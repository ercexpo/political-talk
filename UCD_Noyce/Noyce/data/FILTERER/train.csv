"In what news have you heard is misinformation?

Also, if one is spreading misinformation, don't you believe is is better to just oust them with facts rather than go out and BAN them. I've seen many times someone banned for ""misinformation"" and ""hatespeech"" and when I read it myself it's a complete lie and unfair. In fact I consider them irrefutable at certain times. If one is so wrong surely it wouldn't be hard, certainly if you acknowledge it as wrong, you know the reasons yourself and can specify them for the public.

Especially with twitter who ban posts on covid they label as having a potentisl risk of spresding misinformation. By doing this they pretty much acknowledge people are incredibly credulous and naive. Otherwise why else would they ban it? Surely the individual could judge for themselves whether it is misinformation or not.

Besides. How do we reslly believe a corporation like twitter has our best interests?(As a citizen of America) They are openly are leftist and actively censor snd silence opposing views. Trunp is banned while we have terrorists like the Taliban alloud on there.

In my opinion they just censor opposing views because they know there is the fear of convincing them they(the poster) are right. In which they don't want that for propably some self centered reason or they want to maintain along with all other sources a monopoly on news with leftist indoctrination(Trans, LGTBTQ+, Feminist movement?, and whatever else.

"Not to belittle a tragedy but the people killed by covid make up an extremely small percentage of the population. The US is home to over 328 million people. Total cases over the entire pandemic is only 40 million. The covide death toll is absolutely not responsible for the labor shortage. 

To provide an example where a large event did cause some labor problems look at WW1. The war depopulated entire villages, but even that was due in large part to poor conscription and assignment practices. It saw around 20 million dead spread across Europe and other participating nations.

The black death also caused some labor shortages, but again it killed way more people. Estimated around 25 million.

Many teams have aggressive names: the Bears, the Bengals (tigers), the Eagles, etc.  In a similar vein, the name Redskin was chosen because American Indians were viewed as tough warriors.  It was really intended as a compliment.

The people claiming that Redskins is a racist term have not been able to find a single documented instance of the term Redskins being used in a derogatory manner since the 1920s.  It's doubtful there is single person alive who has heard the term Redskins used as a racial slur.  The meanings of a word sometimes changes and the word Redskins is one such word.

Education is a good investment from an individual, family, community or national perspective and tuition free education will reduce the burden from the root on our medical expenses too for example.

Healthcare for all is actually CHEAPER with the insurance industry off of the table along with most of the time lost due to billing among many other reasons.

A universal basic income (UBI) is CHEAPER than all of the thousands of individual federal, state and local social safety net programs including things like Social Security and unemployment insurance, etc with all of their budgets, overhead expenses and inefficiencies eliminating the humiliating need for people to lose time to prove their poverty to qualify for aid.

Internet for all is a great and necessary investment to give everyone the opportunity to study, search for work, work remotely, etc online.

Solar power is CHEAPER and electric vehicles are soon to be CHEAPER to make and already are considerably CHEAPER to maintain and operate, especially if charged from your own solar power.

What do you think will happen to crime rates, peace and equality in general after we launch universal healthcare, a universal basic income, universal education and internet for all, raising the starting point of capitalism from zero, we‚Äôll let you die with no money, to a level of life with dignity, reducing societal daily fears on a massive scale and freeing us to welcome the automation revolution with open arms rather than with fear and great harm? üòÉ EqualityMovemen

"The declaration of independence was a document explaining why British citizens were overthrowing their government and included specific examples of abuses by the king to justify why they were doing it to gather support from other British subjects living in the colonies and other European powers.

The Constitution was created to create a new constitutional republic to replace a failing confederacy of states. It includes a blue print for how this government should operate and how it can be changed through constitutional amendments. All states ratified this through a vote making it the new law of the land.

The bill of rights were added later through the amendment process established in the constitution because it was the law of the land. 

There is no, we declared independence so you can legally do it whenever you want clause.

A choice to live for themselves and their selfishness or to live for God. ""Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve."" [Josh.24:15]. People are born with a CHOICE!

"CENK! I admire you but the way you silenced Ana here was prettier horrendous. This was after all a section introduced and presented by her about the Taliban literally holding new media hostage in Afghanistan. You decided to steal the segment by turning it into an attack on your American media rivals. When Ana tried to respond to this you cut her off repeatedly and then said ""hold on"" which suggests you will allow her to respond at the end. But once you made your point you ended the section without allowing her any retort. 
The Taliban taking total control of the media is an important story but you dismissed it and silenced Ana voice by wagging your finger at her and then holding your hand up to silence her in a very dictatorial fashion. 
This came off terribly. I'm not saying this as some sort of fan of Ana, I actually think she too often doesn't do her due diligence before reporting on a story and it clearly shows but as a boss I would never raise my voice to literally drown out the voice of a female staff member while wagging my finger at her and then use the ""stop!"" hand gesture to silence them.

"Sorry, but this data is completely made up.  Please check the government sites for Sweden and Israel for factual data.  Also, no country is currently on their 3rd shot of vaccine in other than critical care deployments.   This is just designed to rile people up and try to prove a point that isn‚Äôt supported by either measured fact or by critical reasoning.  Vaccines work.  Masks work.  Social distancing works.  The USA proved this was effective under both Trump and Biden.  Now we‚Äôre suffering again thanks to people spreading these lies.  Viruses mutate.  That‚Äôs why we get a different flu vaccine every year.  Covid mutated in the the more aggressive and dangerous Delta variant.  Now people with no defenses, folks who refuse to get vaccinated, are being hit hard.  This sucks and is completely avoidable.  How do I know this.  I‚Äôve got two doctors in my family, both working ICUs.  Both watching people suffer and die.  Direct observation of fact.  Please get vaccinated and end this.

Edit:  As I noted in a follow up comment below, I was looking at the unvaccinated occurrence of infection, not the overall country rate.  But this also bought up the key difference in vaccination between Sweden and Israel.  Sweden is far more vaccinated than Israel is.  Hence lower  Hence relaxation of mask and social distancing.  Vaccinate and wear masks to help protect the unvaccinated.",0

From the things you said you liked, you are def more Democrat as Republicans actively want all those to go away.they hate unions. Hate regulations. Hate employee protections. Want no min wage. Want no osha. Want people working more hours and less days off. Democrats don't like big govt they think the govt should be there to help people when they need it and protect people when they can. Gop uses that to con people into saying dems want to control our lives. Which is what they want to do while claiming they are getting govt off people backs. Whatever that means.

What is your basis for the punishment for murder? Or do you not believe murderers should be punished?,1
A police chief talking to the president of the United States like that should be fired.,1
"No it doesn't. Nor does it have to have ""exceptions for life of the mother"" either. The latter is the only possibly compelling exception and even then it falls flat on its face because in no other realm is failure to medically save (in this case the baby) applicable to murder. 

You cannot fail to save with malice aforethought and despite taking every reasonable action still murder the person. That's just nonsense because the malice aforethought part is contradictory to the actions trying to save another. Doctors aren't perfect and fail to save people all the time and it's not murder. So why would it be any different for the unborn child that you suggest abortion be legal so that they can be killed? It doesn't make sense. Either the child is going to die regardless what you do and you can save the mother, or the child lives and the mother lives.

So no, the law doesn't need to make any exceptions for this. If you murder the child, you should be punished. Period.",0

"1.  Volunteer with your local chapter of the Democratic party.  Party planks and platforms are often written by the small number of people who bother to show up.  Having been involved with local democratic politics throughout my teens and early adulthood (I've had to stop since it's considered a conflict of interest with my current job) I can assure you, the people showing up are not always the people we want writing the party platform.  Most the people showing up have big financial interests in getting certain things done.  If we want democracy to work, we need to be more active in it.

2.  Vote in every election, especially at the local level.  The local level has huge influence on your day to day life, your vote carries more weight at the local level, and our next national level candidates have to get their start somewhere.  Voting in every election also means doing your homework.  Get to know the candidates.  For my most recent state delegate primary, I had a chance to talk with both the individuals on the ballot and got a solid feel for both.  It was clear the less funded guy was better to me, but he lost pretty decisively.  So few people do the homework so the woman with the slick mailers won.

3.  Run yourself.  As I already said, democracy only works if we work it.  If the people running aren't getting the job done, then someone else needs to step up.  And frankly, I'd rather vote for the reluctant candidate running to do the right thing than the person who really wants power.  I'm afraid of people who want power.

You'll notice my advice has nothing to do with this particular issue.  That's because if we don't get the foundation right, we will never be able to get the big stuff right.  It's all hard work I propose, no easy answers I fear.",0

I would assume it extends variably to the rest of the country, but only speaking for my area, the major problem seems to be key industries not recovering fully hold back others. The biggest one I hear from prospects  is childcare. Many childcare facilities that existed pre-covid don't exist now. And the ones that do charge significantly more than they did before, because supply is low and demand is high, so they can easily. Everyone knows childcare is expensive, but when it goes up 30 or 50 or 100% or more over a year, many of the people who were working just dont make sense anymore unless they get a raise or a different job, and thats IF you can find one that can and will take your money. Theres waiting lists everywhere for childcare.

There's been a return somewhat to having a stay at home mom or dad in many families because working where they worked before is now negative money. Our economy has been used to having more adults in the labor force, as opposed to a single household earner. A return to that in any significant percentage easily continues the trend we are in now. Low supply and crazy demand.",1

The Texas 'heartbeat ban' isn't medically accurate because there's no heart that early in pregnancy, providers say

Many women don't know they're pregnant at 6 weeks, when a pregnancy is still an embryo.¬†HUIZENG HU/ Getty Images

""Heartbeat bills"" are misnomers because there's no heart nor beating at 6 weeks of pregnancy.¬†

Doctors can only detect fluttering cells that will become the heart, and call it ""cardiac motion.""¬†

A 6-week pregnancy is an embryo, not a fetus, and fetal heart development is a continuum.¬†

The new¬†Texas law banning abortions after 6 weeks of pregnancy,¬†like others like it, is often referred to as a ""heartbeat bill,"" indicating a cutoff point when doctors can detect a fetal heartbeat.¬†

As Texas Governor Greg Abbot¬†said in a Facebook video¬†right before signing the bill, it ""ensures that the life of every unborn child who has a heartbeat will be saved from the ravages of abortion."" The law is expected to be challenged and, if it prevails, will go into effect September 1, 2021.¬†

But¬†Dr. Bhavik Kumar, a family medicine physician and abortion provider at the Planned Parenthood Center for Choice in Houston, told Insider ""pregnancies this early do not have a beating heart"" ‚Äî and that's a medical fact.¬†

For one, a pregnancy that's six weeks along is still an embryo. It's not a fetus until the 9th week after conception or 11th week after the last menstrual period, according to¬†Healthline.¬†

Plus, most women don't even know they're pregnant at six weeks, let alone get a doctor's appointment to confirm it.¬†

""At six weeks, most women would not have any clue they were even pregnant if they weren't carefully tracking menstrual cycles, and that doesn't even take into account the millions of women with irregular cycles who might go six weeks or longer between periods as a normal part of their life,"" Dr. Stephanie Ros, an OB-GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of South Florida, told Insider.¬†

She said at that point, the embryo is a quarter-inch long. ""It's barely noticeable on ultrasound, we often have to use transvaginal ultrasound to be able to see it at all,"" she said.¬†

What's really happening is 'cardiac motion' from cells that will become the heart

The so-called ""heartbeat"" that's detected at six weeks isn't a heart nor is it beating. ""There's electrical activity within cells that will become a heart, and we see that on an ultrasound machine as a flickering that can be audible through the machine,"" Kumar said. ""We refer to that as cardiac motion.""¬†

""Certainly different people have different feelings around seeing that and what that means,"" Kumar added, ""and that is up to each person to decide how they value that.""¬†

Indeed, the president of the¬†American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which represents more than 60,000 OB-GYNs in the US,¬†made a similar point in 2019¬†in opposition to ""heartbeat bills.""

""Pregnancy and fetal development are a continuum,"" he said. ""What is interpreted as a heartbeat in these bills is actually electrically induced flickering of a portion of the fetal tissue that will become the heart as the embryo develops."" That tissue continues to develop throughout the first trimester.¬†

Only in the past few decades has the technology been advanced enough to detect cardiac motion that early, Dr. Saima Aftab, medical director of the Fetal Care Center at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami,¬†told LiveScience in 2019. The fluttering, she said, also doesn't indicate the viability of the future heart or the pregnancy.¬†",0
"You gave me a tough job today, man. I like you.

While I appreciate your admission here (truly I do), we cannot allow your behavior here. If you truly want to engage us, do so without venting at us. We are not your enemy and your ideas might indeed be wrong, but you won't find out if they are and you won't imporve them if you just treat people like shit.

I do apologize, but I have to ban you. I will make it temporary, but it will be pretty long because you don't seem to be a Republican. Seriously though, I do appreciate that you realize what you are doing and seem somewhat remorseful about it. I seek to be more like Jesus, too. It can be really fucking hard, but it's worth it.

God loves you, man.

I strongly suggest reading the Gospel of John and Acts to see what Jesus teaches. It is so on point with what I am absolutely sure you believe to be moral, that you might even see that he's calling to you. All you have to do after that is ask him into your heart and believe he has been raised.

I hope to hear that you have accepted him into your life soon, he's already accepted you.",1

"When the government spends this massive an amount of money, they are borrowing or conjuring up money in some way.  Those dollars now compete with our dollars in the market for the same goods.  Supply of money is up, demand for goods is up due to government spending, leading to of the dollars in people's savings and retirement funds.   Those in or near retirement are typically on fixed incomes or invested in less volatile, lower return assets such that they can't keep up with high inflation.  Those in the workforce and earlier in thier investing years are invested in riskier assets who's return is more likely keep up with inflation and in theory their wages rise with inflation (in theory...). In any case, every dollar you have is worth less, and every dollar you have borrowed and spent is also worth less.

I was disappointed not just because of how he spoke to the governors but also that he decided to use force as a first solution. should never be a first solution, no matter the circumstances. Here‚Äôs why. First depending on who you‚Äôre picking a fight with and how many, they might beat you senseless. Second all you are doing is making yourself look like the bad guy which is okay if you‚Äôre trying to conquer someplace but not such a good a idea to do with your own nation.

"""Liberals, progressives, Democrats and other rational thinkers must accept one crucial reality if they are to save America's democracy: Those who live in the right-wing echo chamber really do believe what they are being told. Those beliefs are now extensions of their core identities...

And as anyone who's watched Fox knows, its fundamental message is rage at what liberals are doing to our country. Over the years the specific message has changed with the times ‚Äî from terrorism to open borders to Benghazi to Christian cake bakers to critical race theory ‚Äî but it's always about what liberal politicians are doing to cripple America, usually with a large dose of thinly veiled racism to give it emotional heft...

The Fox pipeline is pretty simple. Fox News stokes a constant sense of outrage among its base of viewers, largely by highlighting narratives of white resentment and threats to Christianity. This in turn forces Republican politicians to follow suit. It's a positive feedback loop that has no obvious braking system, and it's already radicalized the conservative base so much that most Republicans literally believe that elections are being stolen and democracy is all but dead if they don't take extreme action."" - Unknown",1

That being said, it's been far easier for me as a nuclear advocate to convince a right winger to support nuclear power than to have a left winger support nuclear.

The left bludgeoned the right with emotional appeal and NIMBYism to shut down our stance on nuclear in the general public, meaning that the only options left if you knew solar and wind wouldn't do anything would be to either be silent and keep voting... Or throw your hands in the air. It's so easy to bring right wing republicans who don't believe in climate change back to believing in reasonable stances on environmentalism as long as A) it's incremental and B) you validate their concerns. Same thing I've done with most topics.

And, to be honest, if the right says don't spend money and not solve the problem, and the left says spend more money on something that won't solve the problem... I think not spending money is still a better option.

Agree with u again, financial worth isn‚Äôt decided by you, it‚Äôs decided by the people paying you, and companies make less money the more they pay their employees. No one should be working for an unliveable wage, and since minimum wage hasn‚Äôt exactly continued to be proportional to the cost of living, many people ARE working for less than their worth. People are realizing they are worth more, and hopefully more and more people will realize in the near future. Maybe you don‚Äôt deserve a  $10 million salary, but you certainly deserve more than you make now, as does everyone else on the fucking planet. Your concept of financial worth works, but the people on the other side think everyone is worth pay as little as they can get away with.

Not everyone can just go work 70-90 hours of work or school, and I think the ‚Äújust get a job‚Äù argument is one of the dumbest and most impractical pieces of advice. Not only is the recruiting process hell for everyone, but especially the disadvantaged. Now I‚Äôm glad that you were able to go to school and get what you wanted, but there is no reality where a significant amount of people could do that. Do you really imagine people unhappy with their job haven‚Äôt considered getting a different one? I apologize but this point of contention is bare bones, shallow, and downright ignorant.

I will say your tbh about 40 hours not being that much absolutely decimated my original statement regarding a 40 hour week. You‚Äôre absolutely right, people who only work of the day 5 days a week deserve to be treated like shit by their employers, and since they don‚Äôt work weekends, why do they deserve a reasonable wage amiright???",0

at eighty bucks a pill.

You're a failure if you can't make ends meet
on impossible wages at an impossible cost of living
with a worthless degree you will never pay off no matter how hard you work
while advertisers blare at you about your insufficiencies
,
while the news man tells you war is normal,
while Hollywood tells you the system is working perfectly,
while armed police guard grocery store dumpsters full of food from the hungry,
while executives go on five billion-dollar space rides for fun,
while you live surrounded by screens that tell you you are crazy

take Plutocracipam‚Ñ¢ for your anxiety,
just ninety bucks a pill.
Side effects may include compliance,
acquiescence, subservience, docility,
menticidal ideation,
a marked lack of interest in guillotines,
a dystopian society and a dying biosphere.

And the pundit says
""A new study by a Raytheon-funded
think tank says war is good for the environment,
but first here's a millionaire to explain the benefits of urinating on the homeless.""

And Hollywood says
""Here's a movie about well-dressed attractive people with nice houses
engaging in amusing antics you're too poor and stressed out to experience yourself.""

And the news man says
""Here's a rags-to-riches story which proves capitalism works fine
and you should hate yourself if you can't hack it here.""

And the advertisement says
""Do you feel like you're losing your mind due to your sense of inadequacy
because you can't afford Google's latest NSA surveillance device?
Ask your doctor about Empiradol‚Ñ¢,
just a hundred bucks a pill.""

They lock us in a room
and fill the room with water
and then shame us for drowning
and then charge us for tiny gasps of air
from a hose that leads to an ecosystem
that they are destroying as quickly as they can.

And hey I've invented a new antidepressant anti-anxiety antipsychotic
that I'm getting to market as quickly as I can.
It's not a pill or a jab or an electrical shock treatment,
it's just a big wad of cash taken by force from thieving megacorporation

Side effects may include peace and relaxation,
an ability to buy food and think clearly,
a fondness for red flags,
and a hysterical corporate media.

And hey I think we just might make it,
past the veil of madness and cutthroat cruelty.

And hey I think there's something deep within us
as yet untapped and as yet unrealized.

And hey I think an earthquake's coming
that just might topple the towers of madness

No need for birth certificates there will now be Conception Identification with only a number until other information is obtained. Can a person legally not have a name? If not- you must be named as soon as conception is confirmed. As a zygote is now *life* a new *possible life* will likely be recognized. As such, male masturbation will be closely monitored and prohibited as it does not occur without external stimulation. Sex without procreative intent will be discouraged and you can bet birth control will be next to go. Any age restricted right will be measured from conception, obviously.

Over the years the specific message has changed with the times ‚Äî from terrorism to open borders to Benghazi to Christian cake bakers to critical race theory ‚Äî but it's always about what liberal politicians are doing to cripple America, usually with a large dose of thinly veiled racism to give it emotional heft...

The Fox pipeline is pretty simple. Fox News stokes a constant sense of outrage among its base of viewers, largely by highlighting narratives of white resentment and threats to Christianity. This in turn forces Republican politicians to follow suit.

Yet, early in the pandemic he pushed the line that the virus spontaneously popped up in a wet market in the same frigging city where they were studying this specific thing. 

He knew, he lied, and he may very well have been the cause of the entire massive catastrophe that COVID19 and will forever be.  It's not a stretch to make this claim. 

It is entirely possible that the man who was instrumental causing the deaths of over 4.5 million people and the loss of trillions of dollars in economic activity is in fact the same man that is being celebrated as a hero by people like Trevor Noah, John Oliver and others. In fact, there appears to be solid evidence to this.

Let me just give you a glimpse to what I'm referring to:

* NYTimes + Senator Coons makeup stories to blame the Ethiopian PM as cause.
   * [
* The Telegraph jumping through hoops to blame Ethiopians of Genocide.

Seriously talk to an Ethiopian. Ask them about news coverage. Ask them about the Democratic Party & Biden. If what I say is a lie you'll see it reflected in their words.

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature‚Äôs God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation‚Ä¶.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.‚ÄîThat to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. ‚Äî That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness‚Ä¶ it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.****",1

"Ok, so to be clear, I gave you an opportunity to defend your statement that this table is false. And you essentially refuse to take it, saying you don't care to research the topic and based on your edit only spoke up in defiance of the information because you want to mirror republican behavior.

But like I said, and proved, above. When we disagree we often have evidence to back it up. We don't disagree because the information provided hurt our feelings.

Also you say stats can be and are manipulated. I 100% agree with you. I have an example.

The other day I saw a news clip that said, ""vaccinated people have a 99.999% survival rate. Unvaccinated people are 25 times more likely to die"" that sounds drastic! 99.999% survival rate vs 25 times more likely to die... Let's do that math.

100 - 99.999 = 0.001 (chance of death while vaccinated)

0.001 x 25 = 0.025 (25 times more likely to die while unvaccinated)

100 - 0.025 = 99.975% chance of survival for unvaccinated people.

Yet people are losing careers over vaccine mandates... For a vaccine that doesn't prevent you from contracting or transmitting. It doesn't even prevent you from dying. For an experimental technology (mRNA) that has never gone past lab trials before this year so there is ZERO long term effect studies.

"I agree, there are a lot of reasons why Bolsonaro got there in the first place. I even voted for Bolsonaro in 2018, but because I was disillusioned with the polarized reality of that time and thought he represented a drastic change and action, but as it turns out he was another right-wing populist nutjob, and I slowly began realizing it just like many americans did with Trump. You rightfully point out the Supreme Court is politically appointed, but guess who appointed a judge who freed Lula from jail? You rightfully point out corruption is rampant, but guess who is the one who destroyed the Car-Wash Operation? Yes, Bolsonaro, because turns out, he is a corrupt crook along with his entire family. In the beginning, I used to believe that ""Bolsonaro is a fascist who wants to be dictator"" was just leftist conspiracy, but the more he began actually voicing against democratic institutions, the more I realized all these speeches about ""cleaning the swamp"", or about ""saving the nation"", or about ""the corrupts within congress"" have always been far-right dogwhistles and I had fallen this conspiracy rabbithole, which I have slowly been escaping ever since the pandemic began.

So no, there's no such a thing as ""communist-inclined"" opposition against Bolsonaro, because a lot of prominent right-wing political movements such as the MBL broke off with Bolsonaro, so his opposition is pretty broad even though there are indeed left-wing people in the opposition, just like every opposition against a far-right government. No, there is no such a thing as ""Bolsonaro is for electronic plus paper ballot"", because even if he was for that, the true intention of his when voicing for this agenda is to make people distrust the system and de-stabilize democracy so he can come out as ""the man who will solve it all"", and this entire agenda of electronic plus paper ballot is another dogwhistle for ""the democratic system is bad and I want to be dictator"". Yes, there is no transparency throught society and yes Brazil is a banana republic, but the ""twist"" is that Bolsonaro himself is part of the infamous ""Centr√£o"" of brazilian politics, you know, the ""banana politicians"" themselves, of the rich and powerful?

To summarize: the only thing Bolsonaro ever did for Brazil is to pave the path for the gangsters of Lula to come back and continue their legacy of corruption in the name of the poor, he destroyed the legacy of the sane right-wing who only wanted to fight the corruption of Lula and the PT, and most importantly: the deaths of thousands who fell into his far-right rethoric that the ""virus doesn't exist"", or ""if it exists, China made it up"", just like what happened to many americans with Trump. So fuck Bolsonaro, fuck his far-right nutjobs and fuck his terroristic ""milicias"".",0

What he said was, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a nice ‚Äúnews‚Äù skirt‚Äù‚Äî  They played a clip of Dore saying, (this is not verbatim) ‚Äúi made her feel terrible, and ashamed‚Ä¶ I did that‚Äù ‚Äî then the clip stops and Cenk calls him a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù.

He didn‚Äôt sound like he was advocating for that, but just making a point on reparations as a whole.

Financially you are only worth what someone else is willing to pay you. You don‚Äôt get to determine your own financial worth. Otherwise, I‚Äôd determine my financial worth to be $10 Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have any skills that are worth $10 therefore no one values my financial worth at $10  

> People want to be able to survive and be happy without having to kill themselves working 70 hours a week. 

Then get a new job. If working 70 hrs a week is not paying for your needs, you either need to reduce your expenses or get a higher paying job. A few years ago I was making I didn‚Äôt like making that little money. I decided I wanted to make more money. I went on google and looked up high paying jobs. I found one area  that was high paying that I was relatively interested in, and I googled what qualifications I needed to get one of those jobs. For this specific job, it was a specific college degree. Now it doesn‚Äôt have to be a college degree, for some high paying jobs it could be trade school, a software coding boot camp, a certification program, etc. But for this specific job, it was a specific college degree. I then decided to go to school to get this degree. It sucked, and between school and my job I was putting in 70-90 depending on the week. I had no life whatsoever for 4 years, and like I said, it sucked. But it was totally worth it. I now work in the industry that I had originally researched. 

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the pay for your current job, you need to get a higher paying job. In order to get a higher paying job, you need to acquire a skillset that people will be willing to pay you money for. Like I said above, this doesn‚Äôt have to be school, as school can be expensive. However, there are plenty of affordable ways to attend school, and I am perfectly happy to share these with you (or anyone else) if you care, and I would love to help. Regardless, trade schools and certification programs can also be great ways to increase your skillset. 

> Even people working 40 expect to make a reasonable wage and be valued as employees. 

Tbh 40 hrs a week really isn‚Äôt that much. At 8 hrs a day, 5 days a week, that‚Äôs literally of the day you don‚Äôt have to work, and you still have the weekend on top of that

> People want to be able to retire comfortably without having a $100k salary their whole life. People want to work to live, not live to work. 

You don‚Äôt need anywhere close to a salary for your whole life in order to retire comfortably. You can retire comfortably on far less (I guess it depends on what your definition of comfortable is). Again, if you (or anyone else) wants more information on how to do this, please let me know, or visit It‚Äôs really not difficult at all, and I‚Äôd love to help where I can.

">The basis behind anti work is just providing the bare minimum shelter, food, healthcare to everyone so they're not 'forced' to work.

Everything essential for living could be provided to an individual but work would still absolutely be required. In fact it would no longer be optional at all. when services are provided for free what incentive is there to do it? I don't know how many people would work in a warehouse for free and the same goes for teachers, doctors, surgeons. These are absolutely essential positions that now need to be assigned rather than staffed voluntarily. You can't just not pay these people.

You can advocate for a higher wages thats fine, but removing or severely reducing salary *(Which would absolutely be necessary in a gov. controlled scenario)* has dire consequences. This is why the USSR had so many problems. Magnitogorsk is a prime example. So many people died in that industrial hell hole due to the sever lack of any real experience since they just assigned random people to work in the mines & foundries. I mean imagine being told to work as an ER tech with no option to leave or find another job else where.

In any scenario where a large group of people are permitted to contribute nothing to society. There is other which must suffer greatly to provide it. If you can't see that your either an idiot or don't want to acknowledge it.

"In California, a recall election can be put into motion solely by getting a petition signed by a proportion of state citizens equal to or greater than 12% of the number of voters in the previous office election. As such, to force a recall election of Gavin Newsom--who won with 62% of the vote in 2018--only required 1.4 million signatures, or 3.5% of California's population. The recall is costing California $276 million and represents an attempted power grab by Republicans to take advantage of a non-regular election to unseat the democratically-elected governor.

According to the law, the recall is based on two questions: question one is a yes or no question about recalling Gavin Newsom, and question two is who would replace him were the yes vote to receive a plurality of the vote. So, technically, 3.5% of the population forces the other 96.5% to turn out in an irregular election to vote ""no"" by a plurality, or the most popular ""other"" candidate running (currently Republican Larry Elder with about 26% popularity) becomes governor. If a plurality votes ""yes,"" regardless of who they prefer, a candidate with less than 30% popularity can supplant the governor elected with over twice that popularity during a standard, regular election.",0

"How does that alleviate the burden of carrying a rapist's child?  How does that (to put it bluntly) undestroy their body?  How does that prevent the hospital bill, or the trauma of childbirth?  How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria?  How does that make it less of an economic burden to take an unwanted child and foist them into a poorly organized and definitely underfunded foster system (it's Texas, in case you think they care) that _mostly_ results in molestation, prostitution and abuse?  How does that not further the burden of guilt placed on someone who never wanted that child to begin with?

Utterly and completely destroying a good section of the work force, emotionally, physically, financially and in all ways permanently, (unless they have a neuralizer, panacea or a winning lottery ticket respectively) is not good for the economy.

Americans are being killed by the cartels coming into our country with tons of drugs and creating crime nation wide. He is not competent to hold the office. He did not win the election. He has caused more destruction to our country faster than any President  that has ever served. We must remove him asap to give our country a fighting chance to save our country. Please contact  our goverment and let your voice be heard. The phone numbers you can call at the capitol to let your voice be heard is 202-224-3121   202-225-3121. These numbers will connect you with capitol switch board where you can ask to speak with the office of your state politicians. Please get Biden out now before we all pay dearly.,0

You owe it to your American family members that fell at places like Gettysburg, Normandy and Iwo Jima. ¬†You owe it to your current American family and to family members not yet born and whom you will never see but most importantly, you owe it to yourself.

You are now facing the strongest opponent to American freedom that America has ever known and the odds of survival seem long. ¬†How did we succeed in the past against tyranny, oppression and assault?¬†

Some might say that we sent our former family members into battle with the best technology and resources available and they would be partly right. ¬†But our true strength has always resided in our steadfast faith in God. ¬†Our belief that our cause was just and that it was by God‚Äôs hand that we would prevail. ¬†

Let us renew that trust and faith and accept the promise of help in dark times. ¬† Let us unleash the greatest power in creation and call upon our creator to help us in the shadow of what seems to be the death of our Republic. ¬†One nation under God and in God we trust is the cornerstone of this nation.¬†

And so on Wednesday, July 8th let all God loving members of the American family and across the globe unite in prayer that first begins by acknowledging that without Jesus Christ we can do nothing and with Jesus Christ all things are possible for His glory. That in our own words we ask for guidance and direction to do our part in restoring the founding principals of this nation. ¬†And if inclined to do so, share those prayers with others by posting on YouTube. ¬† (Please share this message)",1

It absolutely is.  However, those don't relate to orders Lt. Colonel Scheller was given.

His first video was a violation of Article 88 of the UCMJ.  His second video was a violation of that, and arguably Article 94 also, because it included the statement  ""Follow me, and we will bring the whole [expletive] system down"".  The possible penalties for violation of Article 88 are dismissal, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for one year.  Article 94 has the potential to carry a death penalty.

"Hey man, in this polarized time I'm happy to find common ground. One of my best friends since I moved to GA is a traditional auth left guy, and when we have to talk politics that's our common ground we loop back to.

It is true both sides have their derps, we just need to reel them in. I remember being 'shut down' by someone on the left calling me a climate change denier because I said renewables can't fill our energy needs.

And I get that nothing is being done if you do nothing... But sometimes if you're given two shitty options I'd rather we do the least shitty one. 

As an example, let's say we told two people to each pick up a cinder block and carry it 100m east. If one person is fiddling with the block and then walking 30m south, and the other is kind of sitting there... That would mean the person sitting there is putting us in a better position.  That's how I view it; if we spend ungodly sums of money in renewable tech that won't solve the problem were essentially wasting money. Don't get me wrong, I think the gov should be, in general, supporting tech advancements... But we need to prioritize. If we took half the renewable funds and gave it to the scientists and engineers trying to make  nuclear stations cheaper or faster to construct, it would have actually made a dent.

Cheers to finding common ground, from a right winger to a left winger!",1

Like a month or so ago when the CDC said Florida's daily covid death rates where through the roof, but come to find out the CDC had messed up the data and took a 3 day death total and displayed it as happening in 2 days. There were news articles proving this mistake, in that instance, yes republicans disagreed with stats because they were proven wrong.  


On that note I am giving you a chance to prove this wrong.

Exactly like with the Covid vaccines. That deal has been outstanding for the American people. Could you imagine if everyone had to buy our vaccines out of pocket or through insurance? We probably wouldn't have 25% of Americans vaccinated, and they'd be coming from Europe.

I would laugh in the face of a drug co CEO if he came to me with a bullshit deal like what we have been getting. I would feel like he was spitting in my face. I would kick them out of the White House and call his biggest competitor asking if they would like to be the first drug company to release xyz drug? Yeah? Great, but if Americans are paying for the research we get royalties on sales which will go to help fund future medical research, and there will be cap limits on American patients, with lower caps for the elderly and veterans.

"I've been an American citizen for 26 years. During this time I've been following Russian and American news. I understand two perspectives. Americans aren't being told the truth neither about Russia nor China. In fact, with respect to both, Americans are constantly told lies, especially about China. When Trump was saying let's make friends with Russia, I began to think that Trump really wants to free America from the control of the Deep State because making any deals with Russia is what the Deep State doesn't want, be they Neocons or Democrats. Trump acted like Democrats were preventing him from making friends with or even talking to Putin or having a negotiation, meanwhile he imposed sanctions after sanctions against Russia. Then, at the end of Trump's term, he truly waged a massive anti-China information campaign, similar to the one Reagan waged against the USSR. What this tells me is that Trump wanted to fool everyone that he is a nice guy who wants to make friends with Russia and others. This tells me that he is still down with the people who are interested in regime changes in Russia and China and are not interested in negotiations, which means that Trump isn't any better than Bush, Obama, Clinton, etc. He almost fooled me. I thought that Trump was against the DS, but he was with the Neocons. If he wasn't with the Neocons, then he was surrounded by them, which means that he just couldn't really do anything from the get go and he wasn't in control of anything. They only allowed him to do certain things and said no to everything else. It is a 2-party 1-party system and the president is just a puppet, whether it is Trump, Biden, Obama, or Santa Claus.",1

"Brazilians are clowns...I know it  ran away from the country as soon as I could. The truth however is more complex and it is not fully portrayed around the world. There are things, a few of them where Bolsonaro is right and on point, others show how ill-suited he is. With that being said, the options were even worse in the last elections.
The Supreme Court in brazil is the biggest joke there ever was, it needs to be completely reformed (The US supreme court should also be reformed, by the way)
The brazilians have a supreme court where ANY lawyer, appointed by a POLITICIAN can become a member, no need to be a judge, no need to be someone suited for the job, and that is a lifetime position! ANY supreme court that is unbiased and trustworthy need to be populated by FEDERAL JUDGES, appointe by election amongst all federal judges in the country, and I said JUDGES, not mere, ill-prepared lawyers. The political appointment process needs to be eliminated, and until it is so, no one will trust the courts. (that holds true in Brazil, US or any democracy).
Also, the voting issue, Bolsonaro is for electronic PLUS paper ballot, so it could be audited, similarly to the US...imagine an election where the electronic votes could not be audited? Yes, that is Brazil. But guess, the brazilian (comunists-inclined) opposition is against that. There is no transparency throughout society, and a society that has its powers opaque to its population, is a democracy of the rich and powerful, (like Russia, Belarus, China....and the list goes on) and all of these countries, including Brazil and US are heading that way unless structural changes are made....and those are usually painful.

"I want to push back in the idea that the Dems are outright hemorrhaging minorities.  I think it's important to qualify what's going on here with minorities starting to vote republican. 

Let's look at the 2020 election. The Trump campaign made significant investments in reaching specific minority communities eg. Tejanos in TX, American Indians in NC, and black men in general.

With the first two, the Trump campaign used messaging that spoke specifically  to those groups. Acknowledging their history, and issues specific to them. In contrast the Dems reached out to those groups as members of the ""BIPOC"" Community. The idea of BIPOC people as a group was created by the left and is defined by their ""shared oppression"". This allowed Trump to win groups which republicans never won.

Trump was able to blunt the Dem edge with black men both through his personal appeal and superior messaging. Saying, if I'm president the economy will be so good you can get rich. But again the Dems just lumped them under the BIPOC label and told them if you like trump you're not black.

In conclusion Trump was able to either blunt the Dem edge or win outright with specific minority groups by tailoring messaging for those groups and giving them an optimistic as opposed to a pessimistic message.  The takeaway is that Trump's approach is replicable and useful, but requires significant investments in crafting proper messaging and finding the right groups to target.",0

"If you took 200 billion from Bezos and just handed it out to all US citizens, it would be about $600 per person, one-time.  It wouldn't change anything drastically.  The scale of government spending is so far beyond the ultra wealthy it's obscene.  My point is the ultra wealthy are not the problem or the solution.  They're an inevitable result of a global economy in my view.  They aren't necessarily evil or good, but one thing that's pretty universal is that they have changed the world on a global scale.

The exception to the above being when special interests and lobbyists are pushing policy not in our best interest with billionaire dollars driving policy.  We used to call that corruption or at least a conflict of interest or ethics violation.

I have no idea how to fix it, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, so hold my beer:

1) Remove the power and money from DC by drastically decreasing federal spending and returning power to the states.  I'm thinking decentralization of this power makes it harder to corrupt and more accountable to the people.

2) Cryptocurrency may be a game changer.  I'm sure with its own set of unforseen consequences.


I don't know what the numbers are currently, but Biden was proposing something like 10 trillion in spending over the coming years.  For my household, of which, I'm the only income earner, if we naively just divide 10 trillion by 330 million citizens, then multiple by the number in my household, that's about 150,000 the government is spending of my earnings, on my behalf.  The reality is worse, because the bottom 50% aren't effectively paying federal income tax (though of course they pay other taxes).  I'm sorry, I have better things to spend on than supporting bloated, inefficient government.  That's only proposed new federal spending, I already pay property tax, sales tax, gas tax (presumably for 'infrastructure'), local income tax, state income tax, medicare, social security, and the corporate taxes, etc built into the good we buy.

All things considered, the bureaucrats are probably really close to controlling more of the wealth we produce than we are.  I am not against all taxes, but the way I see it the bureaucracy in DC is effectively a parasite which is bleeding us dry with debt and wasteful spending.  I don't know where all that money goes, but I'm certain obscene amounts are being wasted or even being spent on causes directly opposed to the interests of the citizens paying for this mess.",1

"Name me one, just ONE, ""Conservative"" policy in the last 50 years that has actually helped the majority of Americans.

And it is not just conservatives. Democrats who fashion themselves as ""moderates"" are working for the same people that conservatives are, i.e., the people with the freaking money.",0

"Bernie Sanders
Are you ready for a radical statement? I happen to think that Joe Manchin is right. Yeah, physical infrastructure is terribly important. But I happen to think that the needs of the human beings of our country ‚Äî working families, the children, the elderly, the poor ‚Äî are even more important, and we can and must do both.
Look, everybody in America ‚Äî whether you're Republican, Democrat or independent ‚Äî understands that, for the last many years, the very richest people in this country and the largest corporations have done phenomenally well, while the working class and the middle class of this country struggle, and we have got close to 600,000 people sleeping out on the streets.

Elderly people in America can't afford to put dentures into their mouth. They have no teeth in their mouth in some cases, can't afford hearing aids, can't afford eyeglasses. Working families cannot afford child care for their kids. Young people cannot afford to go to college.

And then on top of all of that, the scientific community is telling us that we're looking at a cataclysmic crisis in terms of climate. Oregon is burning. California is burning.

People are drowning in New York City. Detroit is flooding. Siberia has seen the largest fire on Earth. Drought is happening in places all over the world.

The United States must lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel. This is a crisis we are living in.

So, what polling tells us is that working families all over this country understand that NOW is the time for Congress to address the long neglected problems facing working families. Now is the time to have the wealthy and large corporations -- we've got billionaires in this country who don't pay a nickel in federal income tax.
So, I think we can do all of this. We can do the physical infrastructure.
We can do the reconciliation bill, create millions of good jobs, and finally tell the American people that we are going to stand up for working families ‚Äî not just the rich and the powerful. Let's get it done.

Reminder: The actual cost of the Build Back Better Act is not $3.5 trillion, it's $0. The funding working families need is going to be paid for by taxing the wealthiest and corporations.",1

"Dear: Republican Party

¬† When it came time to protect America you refused when the Alt-Right and the Neo-Nazis came you kept the door open for them. 

When Trump back these hate groups you protected him, a P.R. statement saying you refuse to support racism, then back Trump's hatemongering declarations the very next day. 

Who are you people to accept racism as a political platform? When David Duke supports Trump you did nothing, just give me my Tax Cuts and my Judges Mr. Trump.¬† 

African Americans are being attacked on the streets by Americans for, cooking, sleeping, shopping by Trump Supporters you could care less. 

When Trump broke the law dealing with Russia you protected him again. 

¬† Meanwhile, the hate groups are getting stronger, Anti-Governments Groups increase, but you Republicans do nothing. 

I say this as an independent voter you have permitted Donald Trump to become an American Dictator to keep your power. 

He Attacked Black Lives Matter for his supremacist racist base, for a Photo Op. 
The Republicans did nothing, Terrorist attacked Michigan's Capital you did nothing to stop Trump. 
Trump told the Proud Boys, I'm with you 
The Republicans did nothing. 
The Capital Has Been Attacked and you have settled back and have allowed Donald Trump and his followers to commit treason.¬† 

I say this to you honestly all of you are cowards to the Ameican People. It might not feel that way with the backing of Right-Wing Media, The Power and Money you have gained. 

We all saw it though, time after time watching you allowing Trump to do anything he wanted. 

A police officer has died and yes every one of you Republicans is to blame for his death, Fox News can't help you spin out of this. 

There is no honor, no integrity, or compassion within your party. 

Why do you ignore white supremacy and their organizations?

"The young turks are missing Mr. elders point all together. Intentionally. Mr. Elder is pointing out the absurdities one encounters when going down the rabbit hole of reparations.

Elder opened my eyes on the matter. Made me contemplate some important questions and consider things I had not considered. 

Would Rachel dolezal get reparations? Would Oprah Winfrey? Obama? Kamala Harris? When today there are FAR more poverty stricken white people in America than any other people. Do all black people get reparations even though many NEVER had relatives who were enslaved? What about those black people whose families were actually slave OWNERS? There were many. Who pays these reparations? All white people? All citizens whether they had anything to do with the slave trade or not? Republican families who sacrificed their own flesh and blood to liberate the slaves and end the infamous traffic? People whose families never even lived in the country until maybe 100 years after the infamous traffic of slavery had ended? They owe, too? The South was home to 250,000 free blacks. Do their descendants get reparations, too? There were ~4000 black slave owners owning more than 20,000 slaves. How does that figure into ‚ÄúReparations‚Äù?¬†Since the country‚Äôs founding 306,000 slaves were brought here, but since slavery ended more than 2,000,000 black Africans have come here by choice... another 1,000,000 Black Americans came here by choice and by way of the Caribbean. how does THAT figure into reparations?

Because of Larry elder it now seems to me that the only proper way to handle the inequities of the past is to make sure that our laws are just TODAY. That they‚Äôre applied equally to every citizen. To continue to provide access to opportunity WITHOUT favoring or handicapping ANY racial group.¬†I think that‚Äôs the best we‚Äôve got.",0

"Do you know how much an abortion at planned parent hood or some other abortion clinic is? Honest question I do not know. I found planned parent hood says it could be $0-$1,500. but I am not sure what other places charge, I know in a hospital it can be 5,000 or a bit more for vaginal birth or higher for C-section. How can any women really afford a abortion then or delivery period then? 

You talk about How does that (to put it bluntly) undestroy their body? or the trauma of childbirth? How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria.  Have you seen the side effects of both a hormonal pill abortion or a medical abortion? For hormonal pill, it is not unusual for a women having to go to the hospital because the bleeding does not stop, but continues to get worse. Some women become sick and mentally damaged seeing that amount of blood and the cells of the baby after cleaning up that mess, During the surgical abortion where they stick a vacuum up there, it is not unusual for the doctor to cause damage to the uterus and other organs that actuary harm the chance of having another baby in the future, along with bleeding, and causing tears that might need to be surgically fixed. So you will have to go to the hospital for surgery. which case is all traumatic in my opinion. and more of an economic burden now they have more bills to pay. (not saying vaginal birth or C-section is better they all have their risk too)

to your other argument, why cant an employer higher a temp from an agency? There are temp agency that people do sign up with to find part time work, they usually work part time or full time during a short period of work, do you think those short term workers would like to have that job for a bit?",1

So, please pardon me if I'm not one of the folks this sub is supposed to be for.  But I just feel it necessary to point out how intellectually bizarre the rhetoric against Ivermectin is.

Now, I'm not an anti-vax guy.  I've had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine and have no problem getting a booster if it's necessary.  I was also one of the first people in my state to get COVID in March of last year.  But I respect everybody's choice about what to do with their own bodies.  I'm not taking a position against anyone's rights or decisions.  The point I'm making is solely to reveal what I believe to be an intellectual weakness in the anti-Ivermectin crowd's arguments.

The anti-Ivermectin crowd rails against it because it's ""not meant for humans"" and other similar arguments.  However, Ivermectin is FDA-approved for human use.  And do you know what is **not** FDA-approved?  **The vaccine.**  

So, here you have these people insulting your intelligence over the fact that some folks are taking a drug originally not meant for humans but that eventually became FDA-approved for human use and recognized as having legitimate, beneficial uses in humans.  But those same people are out there pushing crazy ideas like vaccine mandates and prison time if you don't get a substance shot into your arm that is **not** FDA-approved.  

I'm not usually one to just lay into somebody and call them dumb, but in this case, I think it's safe to say that many of these anti-Ivermectin people are, in fact, dumb.  At the very least, they fail to see the intellectual inconsistencies in their positions.  One can only assume that if those same people were diagnosed with a blood clotting disorder that they would refuse to allow a doctor to prescribe them Warfarin.

Market doesn't create jobs like before, why taxes should be raised to pay for new jobs and infrustructure.
Trickle-down ignores that critical effect of computer automation, fuels inflation to give a boost to job loss from automation.
No compelling reason for citizens to pay for automation job-recovery with inflation when it's good times for market(automation).
Automation is good thing, saves time and gains more value than gold.

We allow politicians to invest in automation, they gain more despite job loss so it goes ignored.

"When I was a kid some gigantically fat, gross woman told me I had to leave a public pool because I was upsetting young children because of my leg (I am an amputee). She even put her hands on me to physically force me to leave the pool area, at which point the life guards (and letter the police) got involved. 
     Never mind that I had every right to use the pool and had paid to be there.
     Also, I have been an amputee for 48 years now (since I was 3) and yea, little kids are sometimes scared, but mostly they are curious. If I can talk to them (always with parents permission) they stop being scared right away.
     When I worked at a resort I was swimming laps on my day off when I saw a little girl, about 4 with my fake leg trying to give it to her terrified looking dad.
    The kid was German and was trying to tell her dad, ""Daddy, someone for got their leg. You need to find them and give it back before they fall over.""
    Dad was thinking, ""Oh god, my kid has found someone's prosthetic leg and is playing with it. What should I say if the owner sees this?""
    Well his nightmare had come true. The owner had seen it, but thought it was hella funny.
    Though the child spoke only German, and I spoke only English the father, once he realized I was not upset was happy to translate.
     I was able to tell the child about my leg through her father. The kid was extremely sweet. After I explained about my leg and got her to put it back, she said something and patted my head (I was in the pool at this point) that caused her dad to laugh. She had said, ""You poor man. Not only is your leg gone, you can't even talk.""

For one, caucasians are way too broad of a group.  You wouldn't say blacks have a lot of blood on their hands after what happened in Rwanda.

Secondly, it's not right to pass the responsibility of a previous generation's actions onto the next.  No one should feel guilt or shame just because of the color of their skin.

The point should be to recognize and accept our history so that we can learn from the mistakes of those that came before us.",1

I was raised steeped in Western culture. Grandparents in the German film industry, photographer dad, actress mom. They taught me (some) German and French. Went to international school. Studied physics and medieval studies in a college with a Great Books program. 

I can't think of a better way to spend an afternoon than at the Met or MOMA. 

Am I ""proud"" of Beethoven and Mozart? I had nothing to do with them. I enjoy them, I love them, I am deeply moved by them. But pride implies personal achievement. Just look it up: 

1. feeling deep pleasure or satisfaction as a result of one's own achievements, qualities, or possessions or those of someone with whom one is closely associated.
""a proud grandma of three boys""
2. having or showing a high or excessively high opinion of oneself or one's importance.
""a proud, arrogant man""

I am quite proud of a short play I wrote that got a good review in the NY Times. It brought me to LA where I met my wife who was a TV writer. (Our little joke is that we met through the NY Times.)

I am proud of my father's work, with which I had little to do, but I helped him in the darkroom and changed his film sometimes. 

I work in the space program and I'm proud of that, though I'm in a support position and have nothing to do with designing or selecting missions.

"That is an interesting question and I think you are seeing the statements that conservatives typically make regarding individual liberty (i should be able to make my own decisions because I am free to do so, I just have to deal with the consequences of that decision) and relating it to this issue. Is that the case? I'm sorry if it isn't, that's just the connection that I see and would appreciate clarification if I'm incorrect. 
I think the distinction is that we regard the pregnant woman and the unborn baby as individuals with inherent value simply because they are human. That idea has ramifications. We believe both of those individuals have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. So because the baby is a living individual, it has a right to life and should be provided that as much as we are able. Additionally, the destruction of a life, which we would say begins at conception, at the hands of another is murder, which is something we believe is wrong.
I hope this helps. If you have any more questions or would like to discuss things more, feel free to dm me. I know I'm not always the best at clearly articulating my view, so I would be glad to discuss it further.",0

"On 6 Jan 2021 the Congress was discussing the possibility of an illegal election. Before the 1st protested state, Arizona, had the full evidence of the irregularities exposed... a fully orchestrated, illegal, domestic terrorist backed riot took place in the Capitol. The intent of the ""deep state"" was realized when the riot stopped the legitimate debate on the issue at hand. Congress was evacuated and the debate stopped. The Capitol was cleared of rioters, and later that evening, Congress returned and, as expected, the fire for finding the problem had burned out, as the ""deep state"" planned it. There are videos of Capitol Police waving the protestors onto the Capitol lawn and into the building. According to some, facial recognition software has identified ""Antifa"" members in the rioting crowd. As they did in the summer riots, normally peaceful people were antagonized by the anti fascists and followed along. The end result was attained... justifying the means. Debate stopped and Biden was certified by unchallenged slates of electoral votes. The Georgia challenge and the few challenges that came afterward received overwhelming votes against and the electoral protest procedure was halted in tis tracks. Not unexpectedly, there were soon calls from the left for V.P. Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the POTUS... and if he doesn't agree, we will start impeachment proceedings. The ""deep state"" has tried for 4 years to remove Donald J. Trump from office an they will not stop... even 12 days before the end of his term. ""He is dangerous!"", they say. ""He incited a riot!"", they say. The truth is, that with the intelligence that he still has access to... he is a threat to their illegal livelihood and has been for 4 years. It scares them to death that their truths may be revealed. For the left and the deep state, it is truly a matter of life and death to remove Trump. As Hillary Clinton said, (paraphrased), ""If that S.O.B. gets elected, we'll all hang by nooses."" Truer words were never spoken. Donald Trump was not as vindictive as he should have been, and he allowed them to slide. BIG MISTAKE!!!! A majority of the left and a goodly portion of the right are involved in enriching themselves from activities that are surely less than above board in the USA. They all fear the consequences. Some would surely face death for their crimes. We can only pray that justice will be served.",1
