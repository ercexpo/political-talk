2,So does that mean men do have a voice when it comes to abortion now? Or does that not compute?
1,Then shouldn’t us men get a seat at the table for the abortion discussion now?
1,If you can program A Generation of children to believe this kind of bullshit you can easily convince them that America is systematically racist and the vaccinated can be infected by people that aren’t sick.
1,"Whats weirder.   Their contradictions in ""science"" or their love for killing babies?"
1,this what happens when allow post modernist scum to overrun your education system
2,"The word ""fact"" has been politicized, unfortunately.  People use it all the time in attempts to shut down arguments, and it really has diminished the meaning of the word."
2,I honestly cannot comprehend the depth of the insanity with these people. It really IS a mental illness.
2,even the devil realises human society is fucked
1,"My god. What is happening with Gen Z? Can't we returning to the old years where there were Girls and Boys, Women and Men?"
1,"Then men have a say in abortion? Is that the new official ""liberal"" stance?"
1,So it's alright to murder a baby because some people with body dismorphia have babies? WTF is wrong with these people?
1,"If you have two X chromosomes, you’re a female. Last I checked, only humans with two X chromosomes could get pregnant. Doesn’t matter what you identify as or what your birth cert says. Science in this case is fact and if you are pregnant or have gotten pregnant, you are female"
1,"Let me check if a man ever had a baby. 

Nope. Never. 

You know why? Men do not physically have a vagina. 

That’s a scientific fact. But reality doesn’t mean anything to the far-left. If they “feel” it, it’s a “fact.”  

The clowns have taken over."
2,"Wait so it's no longer a women's issue because women don't exist. Meaning men CAN have a valid opinion on abortions. Suggesting otherwise suggests that trans men aren't real men.

It is transphobic to say men can't have an opinion on abortions."
1,"And we wonder why mental illness is more prevalent on the left?

It's because from the moment they're born, they are fed nothing but alternate reality, anti-science propaganda. 

How in the blue hell can you not end up messed up if you believe the world is X, only to grow up and discover that 98% of the world is Y and you're part of the 2% that believe otherwise."
2,I have no compassion for the ignorant.
1,"Well let's see, to leftists, wrong is right, bad is good, down is up, and losing is winning."
1,"Because these dummies think a girl can transform into a dude so when she gets pregnant they think men can have babies...

Reading that logic is like trying to follow a psychopath's mind... unpleasant"
1,"hang on , seriously... I think she might be mentally ill ?what she's saying is beyond lefty nonsense its actually genuinely deranged , even the most ardent of Trans ""female"" activists don't think they can get pregnant ?! you sure shes not a troll?"
2,"she should be banned from social media for stupidity, she doesn't even know what fact means"
2,Jen Psaki begs to differ.  She stated clearly that only women could get pregnant and make hard choices re. abortion.
1,"This is the same kind of person that says men can't make laws about women's bodies. Yet, according to her logic, men can get pregnant? Hmmm."
1,Lol Females are defined as having eggs and getting pregnant under the concept of mammals. You can do some sort of procedure to put eggs in men; but that is obviously not  a man anymore it's a cyborg.
2,Idiocracy was not supposed to be a documentary.
2,I didn't know her post meant every single leftist thinks this way. Hmm. 🤔 what an educated reddit post title.
1,"Anyone else feel like this whole gender thing is a bit of an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" type situation?"
1,Dang the libs need to go to a mental asylum
2,y'all Americans lmao
1,"Leftism is a truly disease, and a with a quick visit to the Front page of Reddit you can clearly see how badly it devastates brain function."
1,"I'm honestly not sure if they are humans anymore. Wondering if the report and the vaccines have anything to do with one another. Seems more likely Liberals are actually just aliens, body snatchers. The vaccine is the delivery mechanism.  


LOL. Please don't think I'm serious.  


But that's what it feels like."
1,I forgot which ivy league school did a study and found that 64% of those that consider themselves liberals have seen a doctor about mental health issues at least once.
2,What if a female doesn’t identify with the term woman but can still get pregnant?
2,"I'm pretty sure that in the human species ,the female is the only gender that can get pregnant."
2,"Wait, I don't understand. Someone please clarify.

Is she referring to Female -> Male trans people who still have the female sexual organs necessary to give birth? With the incomplete surgery techniques we have today, it is still possible to get pregnant after the surgery. Wouldn't they would fall into their own category instead of being called a traditional woman?

I don't know if that's what she means. Of course on the surface it looks completely ridiculous, but maybe the above is what she's thinking..?"
1,I never knew stupidity was contagious until I met a leftist and realized they are allowed to reproduce !
1,"I genuinely don't understand how a grown man can vote Democrat. I would rather be associated with *Qanon* or even Flat Earters, than with countless legions of people on the Left, take your pick."
2,"That is true, I heard that people who speak English can get pregnant, that is a fact 😂😂"
1,"Been saying it for awhile now, liberalism is a mental disorder."
2,So a man has control of his body a woman control of her body? Good to know!
0,"Men: afraid of expanding their vocabulary 

The rest: afraid of not having access to essential health care and human rights. 

Yeah this is a real struggle boys"
0,I’m going to demand my job give me paid ma’ pa’ ternity then! 😂
0,"so what are all of your plans for how long you're going to keep pretending to be surprised trans people exist?

fifteen years, twenty-five years? how long you think you can get out of this"
1,I think that person is referring to how people with different sexual identities can become pregnant. The lack of understanding of this could actually be construed as the brain disease.
2,"To Mrs. Gandy’s claim, this is true for male seahorses and perhaps some other species I’m not aware of, but this is not the case for humans.

  My guess is she’s using the scientific definition of gender while we’re using the legal definition which basically a polite way of saying sex."
1,"I'm not sure, because of the username, but I'm getting the sense that this is a troll. but maybe not? I'm not sure. The fact that we can't tell the difference tells you something about the left."
1,"Pretty sure it is a scientific fact--short of being an organism that can reproduce asexually--that only females can get pregnant.  Something about that being the rule for pretty much every species with males and females.  The left is nuts.  Just because you believe something, that doesn't make it fact.  It makes it your opinion.  Opinions are not facts and wishing them so will never make it true.

Being trans is fine if that's how a free individual wants to live.  I literally don't care.  However, it is completely false to claim that men can get pregnant.  It is their opinion that men can get pregnant because it is their opinion that men aren't defined by measurable biological sex characteristics.  Men cannot get pregnant.  Women who want to be men can."
1,"Ok I'll bite. 

Please tell me where the logic falls down.

If a women transitions to being a man, yet still had a uterus, then they can get pregnant and therefore an abortion.

I'm not trying to argue. Genuinely can't see what the point of disagreement is."
1,"I get the sneaking sense that that's actually the point of the post, and it's actually not a leftist post, but rather someone trolling the left. The fact that we can't even tell the difference shows how ridiculous the left has become."
1,"They are called birthing people now. Remember.
The word mother was not inclusive enough.
It also sickens me how so many people are so for infant murder."
2,Nope. Just the ones who will be getting the abortion. Full stop.
1,Brain damage from those vegan diets and getting vaccinated every two weeks for a virus that cannot be immunized. Pretty sure that's why they also want to be forced into totalitarian rule. Severe brain damage and extreme dependence on the teet of big government.
1,"Depends on your opinion.  We only believe in diversity of genitalia and race, not thought."
1,"Well... I'm with you but how about this?......   
  For the folks that say a woman can have an abortion if they want and a man has no say so, then the man should be able to decide whether he wants to pay child support or not!"
2,I think it's always been batshit. But so many people have access to the internet now. And stupidity breeds stupidity
1,"Imagine someone saying this just 10 years ago. I guarantee 99% of Democrats would think that this is fucking crazy. 

  
They are just so easily brainwashed."
1,Ever since we started having “fact checkers” which is like the Ministry of Truth in 1984
2,"The opposite of a fact would be a falsehood.


>  A lie is a statement made by one who does not believe it with the intention that someone else shall be led to believe it

Or something close to that at least.  "
1,Seeing people denying this biological fact makes me wish there was an actual way to change your biological sex at will so people will shut up about it.
2,"Well said, with little parenting they are in for a big surprise when they need to bring in income to pay living expenses. No more time to ""protest"" day and night when you have a 9-5 job to attend. my office hires recent college graduates, I have been there over 6 years now, more than ever we are denying candidates after the 1st day working interview. It may be coincidence but so far I see a trend of lazyiness and unwillingness to proactive"
2,She's referring to trans men who haven't got bottom surgery
1,"> The funny thing is that they are right. Transmascs and non-binary people with female genetalia can get pregnant. But watch how quick I get banned, because you don't care about the facts, all you care about is ""FuCk ThE LiBs""

They're not right.  Only women can become pregnant.  Men who pretend they are women are not women and can't become pregnant.  ""Non-binary"" is not a sex.  Humans are male or female.  Females can become pregnant, males cannot."
2,However English speakers born without ovaries can’t get pregnant. Lol
1,"I don’t think trans people don’t exist, I think they living a lie. 

You can’t simply change your gender and go against science and biology simple because your feeble reptilian brain “thinks” so.

I feel like a potato sometimes, doesn’t that mean I can identify as one and force my pronouns on others? No, because one you force others to say something, it’s not about respect and more about manipulation and force.

And back to transgenders, I believe everyone should live their life. If you wanna be XYZ behind closed doors go do so. But don’t make it my problem, and force yours views on me. I think everyone should love themself for who they are. 

Don’t even get me started on forcing kids to choose a gender. It’s stupid and pointless. If a child wants to do something, let them do it, unless it could permanently harm them or hurt them, like hormones. And let’s all agree that a 3 year old might not be able to count their fingers twice and get the same number, let alone choose what they want to be in life. If you were to ask a 3 year old what they wants to be when they grow up, they might say Spider-Man FFS."
2,I'm not surprised they exist. I'm surprised they're allowed out of the asylum.
2,"I'm guessin the whole transitioning part? I align with you but I understand the conservatism on this.

One has to understand that LGBTQ community is a part of world's culture not just America. It's a global community. One that can't be done away with."
2,"I had someone I work with comment on Facebook the exact sentiment of the op, unironically. Some really do think this."
1,I mean yeah.. The left is ridiculous... But the right is taking horse dewormer for a virus that doesn't exist....
1,So why do Cali libs care about Texas abortion laws then? 🤔
1,"I always see liberal media say ""What is the Republican Party's obsession with blue hair?"" and play dumb in the article, as if there couldn't be a more obvious indicator of political beliefs by the cookie cutter look that has evolved. It's funny. I have nothing against blue hair, I just think it's funny that obvious signaling is presented as a united front for those that support the politics behind it, and act like it's surprising that other people notice it."
2,"Back in my day, crazy hair and clothes were our way of rebelling against government and authority. Just like everything they steal it. Now to rebel I have to look normal. The future is stupid."
2,Like Trump's?
1,I’m pointing out the obvious hypocrisy of the left saying men can’t weigh in on abortion debate but also men can get pregnant.
2,Exactly. Before most people would just tell them to shut the fuck up. But now they find each other online and continue the echo chamber
1,XXY is sterile so don’t have to worry about abortions
1,"the term trans men its purely  a term I use to be polite , they are not men and never will be men  ..science"
1,"A person who identifies as male but was born with female parts can get pregnant, fact."
2,Because its a societal issue... Not a state issue.
1,"Hm? I didn’t say that at all. I said if a man is pregnant, then that man should have the right to decide what to do with his own body."
1,"Oh I know, I'm agreeing and just saying they don't care about the hypocrisy at all. 
 They only care to hear the opinions of those who fall in line with their insanity, while hypocritically claiming they care about diversity."
1,"They can identify as whatever they want, but this hypothetical person is still a female. An XX biological female human being. Female is a biological term. Whatever is going on inside their head doesn't change their biological sex."
2,"What lie? 

The left IS ridiculous.

The right IS taking horse dewormer."
1,But men can't call it a societal issue because.......? (Insert elitist liberal hypocritical nonsense here)
1,A man can't get pregnant.  I think you mean a woman who identifies as a man.
2,she lives in a fantasy world where her weird world view is universal and uses language like things  have  already been decided in her favor even  though the  vast majority don't agree with her at all
2,There are actually very experimental surgeries on uterus transplants for Trans going M to F but I doubt they mean that since you wouldn't need a abortion if you are actually trying to get pregnant with a huge rare experimental surgery unless something went wrong.
2,"The virus does exist.

Ivermectin is not horse dewormer."
2,The medicine that won't a Nobel Prize in 2015 for its effects on humans? Gtfoh you dipshit. Google shit before you embarrass yourself anymore.
0,Because no one should control another persons body - there was a war about this or something
2,No I mean a man who was assigned female at birth but is a man. But there can of course also be an intersex or nonbinary person who has a uterus.
2,"The first sentence is just blatantly false. Without surgery that is just not the case, except in a super small percentage of genetic mutation cases. Almost universally males have XY and females have XX. This observation is also universal in every mammal on earth"
2,"Sarcasm also exists... Its been the stance of conservatives that covid is a fake for a while... I was being sarcastic.

It is also a cattle-dewormer. And works on PARASITES

Covid... Is a virus."
2,"So much wrong. 

Its an anti-parasite. It won said prize for its work vs parasites. 

Covid is a virus. 

Full stop. 

PS. It 'won' a NPP, not 'won't.' But keep telling others not to embarrass themselves."
1,Then explain how the left is still calling this a wAr oN WoMeN
1,Removed and banned for liberal talking points.
1,"I never met or seen a conservative that believed the virus was fake. Not even Trump. 

Also Ivermectin is IN some horse dewormers, it's primary purpose for being is not as a horse dewormer."
0,"Yes. Trump did call it a hoax. (Which is another way of saying fake) 

Its still only effective against parasites... 

Covid is still a virus."
1,"No... I 'got you' on the definition of a virus v a parasite... The rest was to prove you're full on dumb not just half way. 

Dr's, much like states are unfortunately, woefully, pathetically inequal. Its like comparing the basic humanity of Texas vs Cali, its not a proper comparison. 

Those Dr's should lose their jobs."
2,Yet it IS an parasite med being used for a virus... It deserves the agro.
1,What if you're a pregnant woman? Then it's okay? Just trying to understand the liberal nuance of justifying any and all immoral stances in order to personally benefit
2,I mean if you want to deny him the respect of telling you what he means. The media and leftists were the only ones who thought he meant the virus itself wasn't real.

We have all had quite enough of clown world.. time to get the adults in the room to manage matters.. this is rediculous."
1,"I'd bet that if we had an election again right now, Trump would win by a landslide. Even the most hardcore liberals are regretting voting Biden in, even people I know in real life. There is absolutely no way Biden can even retain a positive approval rating at this point."
0,The worthless Republican squishes must not be awake yet.  I don’t see any “that’s not who we are” crap.
2,"Took 8 months for everyone to hate him and the people that voted for him to take their signs down in shame. The reality is, it isnt your fault if you were fooled by the media and we have all made decisions. Start looking further into things and start fixing how you make decisions or process information. Billions of dollars goes into creating lies and propaganda because it works. This isnt JFK democrat party anymore or the Bush Republican party. Your representation shouldn’t be religious level of faith to a political party."
1,It’s crazy how liberal Reddit is. I think it’s brainwashing voter bots or something it’s like the plague. I’ve considered deleting it because most everyone on here is a Biden dick rider. Nice to see some like minded people on here
1,"Wouldn't ""Dump Joe Biden"" be more accurate?  I mean..I doubt even Jill wants to fuck him."
2,cant believe someone would vote for that douche unreal how dumb people are
1,"Joe Biden is the most professional loser I've ever seen. The guy has gotten away with plagiarism throughout his ""career"", election fraud, having a piece of shit son etc. I doubt Democrats will remain in power after 2022-24 if their house of cards start falling next few years."
2,"Someone named Orange_Star commented on me somehow treading on a groups domain. Sorry to say it this way, but I love my republican brothers and sisters, and I could have once called myself one. Now all I do is watch others be radicalized in an echo chamber of absolute nonsense. 

And I’m even more annoyed to see it working. The radical right and left want chaos and destruction. I want peace and freedom. Also I like to make people think a little deeper about what it is they’re saying. Usually it’s a bunch of bs."

2,"I disagree slightly, not all Democrats are assholes, many of them are good people. The Democratic Party is not the same as the Radical Left. We need the Democratic and Republican Parties to have this country run as intended. We should instead just be chanting the names of people who have changed this country for the worse and have ended thousands of human lives and hold them accountable. Such as Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Patrisse Cullors, Antifa, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and so on..."
2,Wisconsin state I believe.
1,"The Democrats stole the 2020 election, Biden never won in the first place.  But this might all be a blessing in disguise... the incompetence and radical agenda of the Biden administration is showing the country what the left is really about and hopefully that will result in a landslide victories for republicans in 2022."
1,"Sorry.  We were too busy at work.  Checking in at lunch here.  This is pathetic and idiotic.  Biden is a terrible President and I desperately hope the we can put up a candidate who can defeat him in 24, but this accomplishes nothing more than making Republicans look like a moronic fan club to anyone in the middle."
1,Nah. This is who we are. Fuck Joe Biden.
2,"Attacking governments is kinda what Patriots do, hate to break it to you."
1,"You're not entirely wrong, but it must be remembered that Democrats collectively and repeatedly vote to put the radical left in charge.

If you hand the radicals the keys to the bus, and keep giving them gas money, knowing they are radicals, you don't get to claim it isn't your responsibility when the bus goes off a cliff."
2,It just seems like you have no real Argument or point to make against us although you're still angry and so you're just insulting us based on no logic or proof behind your claim. What's irredeemably sad is the fact that you have no leg to stand on and so you're clinging to insults you would hear a 9 year old saying instead of admitting that you're wrong
1,"I share this opinion too. Biden never truly won, I watched it happen on election night and the days after. Although because he's in office now it seems like its given Democrats a taste of what they actually voted for."
1,"Are you serious? Liberal Leftists are the ones trying to disband and overthrow the Government, The Patriots are trying to protect our Free Nation and Government. Patriots wouldn't be supporting America if they weren't supporting the United States Government. Here is the very definition of Patriotic:

2,"Not all of them, a lot of them yes but even some Republicans listen to the left"
1,Latest polls show it would still be a close election. That’s how much the left hates Trump. They would rather vote for the second worst possible person for the job that ran as a democrat.
1,"I saw it happen with my own eyes, in Pennsylvania at my local voting place.  We were given the paper ballots and told to fill in our choices with black sharpies, then slide the ballot into this machine that supposedly read the ballots.  The problem was, the sharpies were bleeding through the front-and-back ballots leaving numerous ""extra"" sharpie circles.  Several of us demanded new ballots that we would fill in with regular pens but were told NO, we had to do it their way.  There's no way that any ballot reader machine was getting the correct reading on those ballots.  This was in a top critical county that went Trump in 2016 that normally leans slightly left so no surprise they went out of their way to cheat."

1,"Combination of that, but even moreso the fact that the Dems have morphed into a party that doesn't care about morals, truth, facts, or results..  And are obsessed with handouts, freebies, white racism, and wokeism.  They've successfully managed to delude the younger generation on all this. 

So they're going to get at least 45-50% of the vote no matter who is running."

No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with covid 19.

2,"I guess that I am by definition a RINO given that I do vote Republican but only because they represent more of my positions than Democrats.  I'm pretty centrist politically speaking.  So, please pardon me if I'm not one of the folks this sub is supposed to be for.  But I just feel it necessary to point out how intellectually bizarre the rhetoric against Ivermectin is.

Now, I'm not an anti-vax guy.  I've had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine and have no problem getting a booster if it's necessary.  I was also one of the first people in my state to get COVID in March of last year.  But I respect everybody's choice about what to do with their own bodies.  I'm not taking a position against anyone's rights or decisions.  The point I'm making is solely to reveal what I believe to be an intellectual weakness in the anti-Ivermectin crowd's arguments.

The anti-Ivermectin crowd rails against it because it's ""not meant for humans"" and other similar arguments.  However, Ivermectin is FDA-approved for human use.  And do you know what is **not** FDA-approved?  **The vaccine.**  

So, here you have these people insulting your intelligence over the fact that some folks are taking a drug originally not meant for humans but that eventually became FDA-approved for human use and recognized as having legitimate, beneficial uses in humans.  But those same people are out there pushing crazy ideas like vaccine mandates and prison time if you don't get a substance shot into your arm that is **not** FDA-approved.  

I'm not usually one to just lay into somebody and call them dumb, but in this case, I think it's safe to say that many of these anti-Ivermectin people are, in fact, dumb.  At the very least, they fail to see the intellectual inconsistencies in their positions.  One can only assume that if those same people were diagnosed with a blood clotting disorder that they would refuse to allow a doctor to prescribe them Warfarin.  You know, since Warfarin is rat poison."
2,You may want to check Merck’s website in regards to ivermectin in regards to covid. They are the company that created ivermectin.
1,"At this point we might as well be a monarchy where the is a figure head. Our country is ran as a buisness. Import, import, import, spend, spend, spend. Money runs this country as do the corporations. Politicians are men and women trained in manipulation and word play through their education. They gain power, maybe for selfish or selfless reasoning but it always ends up with them stuffing their pockets. 

How else you think things dimwitted democrats have such money? Pelosi is worth over $100m. She didn't get that by GIVING like they all say they want us to do. Big pharma and many, many other corporations pay them off. They talk about being Sweden or Switzerland but that'll never happen when you run a poorly managed buisness where more money leaves what its ment for to go to pockets of assholery. 

Sorry for the rant. Been alittle wound up recently."
2,It is 100% idk msm is claiming people are doing this. A hospital had to come out and deny that a doctor said they could not accept gunshot patients sue to beds being full of people who died in this.
2,"The Pfizer vaccine is FDA approved though, at least for ages 16+"
2,"You almost had it then lost it in the second paragraph.  Corruption runs deep in congress. Not a left side or right side. NRA, oil and fuel companies funds GOP .  Green energy  pharm funds the left. Problem is no term limits. Problem is the middle class and lower class working people cant afford to donate $10k to their representatives to keep them in a seat in congress. So what does congress do? Look to the top 1% for funds. In return, bills and laws are passed that are more in line with corporations than in line with we the people. Our donations are petty and not enough for them. 

Our founding fathers warned us of a two party system. Its destroying our country.  Last time this country came together was/2001. There was no hate against race, religion and sex within America against  each other. that didn't matter. Now we cant even come together for a virus thats making millions of people sick making 10s of thousands of people die. My parents were and still is trump supporters but they still took their chance on science  and took the vax.

My opinion. Our country is more in line with Corporatocracy than anything else."
1,"yeah its sad people dont wonder where people like Pelosi life long grifters worthless insects , that have done ZERO worth mentioning , get so much money from ,"
1,"The rest aren't, though, which is the whole point.  The whole ""get the vaccine"" crowd have pushed any vaccine you can get your hands on.  And they've been doing it since well before the Pfizer vaccine was approved, so the fact that it is approved now doesn't give them a leg to stand on.  They still pushed experimental substances that were not FDA-approved to be forced on people while using disgusting rhetoric against people who tried other experimental treatments.  It was always an intellectually dishonest position."

2,"I honestly don't think it is going to have much of an impact. I deal with hiring in Florida where the extra benefits were gone over 2 months ago, and it has only gotten more scarce. Way more scarce if I am honest.

I would assume it extends variably to the rest of the country, but only speaking for my area, the major problem seems to be key industries not recovering fully hold back others. The biggest one I hear from prospects  is childcare. Many childcare facilities that existed pre-covid don't exist now. And the ones that do charge significantly more than they did before, because supply is low and demand is high, so they can easily. Everyone knows childcare is expensive, but when it goes up 30 or 50 or 100% or more over a year, many of the people who were working just dont make sense anymore unless they get a raise or a different job, and thats IF you can find one that can and will take your money. Theres waiting lists everywhere for childcare.

There's been a return somewhat to having a stay at home mom or dad in many families because working where they worked before is now negative money. Our economy has been used to having more adults in the labor force, as opposed to a single household earner. A return to that in any significant percentage easily continues the trend we are in now. Low supply and crazy demand."
2,I see the economic collapse is still coming together right on schedule.
1,"With how much they were getting from unemployment I personally know 2 or 3 people who just saved that money to continue living without working for any wages, eventually those savings will run out but this whole thing has really made people lazy as all hell."
2,I’m sure another “relief bill” is on the way
1,Unemployment shouldn't be a way of living. Nobody should be on unemployment for more than a month or so.
2,"Speaking as someone who was laid off because of COVID last year and who was using the extra benefits, it's about time. After I got laid off, I qualified for a state program that I used to go back to school 100% paid for, and have about a year left until I graduate. Trying to find work in the IT field with no experience is tough though."
2,I just wanna know what all these fucking Marines are gonna do to keep busy...
2,Most people in the states with low cost of living will just collect regular unemployment since they probably have a pretty nice savings. Imo I don’t think the labor market will return to pre covid levels until next year.
2,Good news their are 10 million job openings
1,"This is not the time to spike the football.  Unemployment benefits are a smokescreen wedge issue that Democrats are going to use to climb back over the ledge that Afghanistan, COVID and the economy pushed them off.  The campaign ads write themselves: ""Republicans want people off benefits so they can go back to the jobs that are in demand: servile, demeaning unskilled labor that keep people in a cycle of poverty for generations.""  Instead of letting the clock run out, maybe conservatives should have come together to push policy that expanded the middle class.  That way, when Democrats did block it (because it has Republican names on it), they would have to eat more shit at the ballot box.  Instead, our guys handed them a W, it's fucking retarded."

2,I was talking to my dad because he is in charge of hiring for his company that he’s part owner of and he says that between this and about 2007-2008 this is probably the worst job market he’s ever seen because of the unemployment
1,"I caught imagery of DDL at the end of “There will be Blood.” These benefits, IMHO, have been a harsh detriment on the country for the past 9 months. At first, yes, of course, these benefits were needed and wholesomely welcomed. But then the prolonged shutdowns  and stay at home orders created this golem in humans; which was lazy, un-dedicated and slothful. Maybe some of these people already had this golem in them and these benefits just fed into it more. Maybe some of these people were hard workers and developed this golem because of the hardy benefits. Whatever this case, the government should be held accountable for this, but they won’t."
2,There’s 9Million jobs open right now - staffing levels are still going to be difficult for the lowest paid jobs.

> People are tired of the working conditions and expectations that have developed, and have finally discovered their worth as employees, 

Financially you are only worth what someone else is willing to pay you. You don’t get to determine your own financial worth. Otherwise, I’d determine my financial worth to be $10 Unfortunately, I don’t have any skills that are worth $10 therefore no one values my financial worth at $10  

> People want to be able to survive and be happy without having to kill themselves working 70 hours a week. 

Then get a new job. If working 70 hrs a week is not paying for your needs, you either need to reduce your expenses or get a higher paying job. A few years ago I was making I didn’t like making that little money. I decided I wanted to make more money. I went on google and looked up high paying jobs. I found one area  that was high paying that I was relatively interested in, and I googled what qualifications I needed to get one of those jobs. For this specific job, it was a specific college degree. Now it doesn’t have to be a college degree, for some high paying jobs it could be trade school, a software coding boot camp, a certification program, etc. But for this specific job, it was a specific college degree. I then decided to go to school to get this degree. It sucked, and between school and my job I was putting in 70-90 depending on the week. I had no life whatsoever for 4 years, and like I said, it sucked. But it was totally worth it. I now work in the industry that I had originally researched. 

If you aren’t satisfied with the pay for your current job, you need to get a higher paying job. In order to get a higher paying job, you need to acquire a skillset that people will be willing to pay you money for. Like I said above, this doesn’t have to be school, as school can be expensive. However, there are plenty of affordable ways to attend school, and I am perfectly happy to share these with you (or anyone else) if you care, and I would love to help. Regardless, trade schools and certification programs can also be great ways to increase your skillset. 

> Even people working 40 expect to make a reasonable wage and be valued as employees. 

Tbh 40 hrs a week really isn’t that much. At 8 hrs a day, 5 days a week, that’s literally of the day you don’t have to work, and you still have the weekend on top of that

> People want to be able to retire comfortably without having a $100k salary their whole life. People want to work to live, not live to work. 

You don’t need anywhere close to a salary for your whole life in order to retire comfortably. You can retire comfortably on far less (I guess it depends on what your definition of comfortable is). Again, if you (or anyone else) wants more information on how to do this, please let me know, or visit It’s really not difficult at all, and I’d love to help where I can.

Okay"
2,"Thanks for the reading suggestion.
I, too, have been skeptical about the financing method of UBI, and it's a semi absurd concept for me. Europe already has quite extensive basic income systems, but they are bound to conditions. A few countries have UBI test phases from time to time.
I think it's an interesting concept and am interested to see how it will work out.

I can somewhat relate to many if these topics, because i changed workplaces during lockdown for a job that sounded less prestigious on paper, but pay was significantly better, more time off, more benefits, less micromanagement, less pressure ""from above"". And that functions quite as well.
I understand you can't have all the benefits in every job, and sometimes you'll need minimum wage to mop up the floor or something, but everyone need to finde their niche where they can lead a fulfilling life."

1,">The basis behind anti work is just providing the bare minimum shelter, food, healthcare to everyone so they're not 'forced' to work.

Everything essential for living could be provided to an individual but work would still absolutely be required. In fact it would no longer be optional at all. when services are provided for free what incentive is there to do it? I don't know how many people would work in a warehouse for free and the same goes for teachers, doctors, surgeons. These are absolutely essential positions that now need to be assigned rather than staffed voluntarily. You can't just not pay these people.

You can advocate for a higher wages thats fine, but removing or severely reducing salary *(Which would absolutely be necessary in a gov. controlled scenario)* has dire consequences. This is why the USSR had so many problems. Magnitogorsk is a prime example. So many people died in that industrial hell hole due to the sever lack of any real experience since they just assigned random people to work in the mines & foundries. I mean imagine being told to work as an ER tech with no option to leave or find another job else where.

In any scenario where a large group of people are permitted to contribute nothing to society. There is other which must suffer greatly to provide it. If you can't see that your either an idiot or don't want to acknowledge it.

This capitalist society we've been living in isn't democratic.

Agree with u again, financial worth isn’t decided by you, it’s decided by the people paying you, and companies make less money the more they pay their employees. No one should be working for an unliveable wage, and since minimum wage hasn’t exactly continued to be proportional to the cost of living, many people ARE working for less than their worth. People are realizing they are worth more, and hopefully more and more people will realize in the near future. Maybe you don’t deserve a  $10 million salary, but you certainly deserve more than you make now, as does everyone else on the fucking planet. Your concept of financial worth works, but the people on the other side think everyone is worth pay as little as they can get away with.

Not everyone can just go work 70-90 hours of work or school, and I think the “just get a job” argument is one of the dumbest and most impractical pieces of advice. Not only is the recruiting process hell for everyone, but especially the disadvantaged. Now I’m glad that you were able to go to school and get what you wanted, but there is no reality where a significant amount of people could do that. Do you really imagine people unhappy with their job haven’t considered getting a different one? I apologize but this point of contention is bare bones, shallow, and downright ignorant.

I will say your tbh about 40 hours not being that much absolutely decimated my original statement regarding a 40 hour week. You’re absolutely right, people who only work of the day 5 days a week deserve to be treated like shit by their employers, and since they don’t work weekends, why do they deserve a reasonable wage amiright???"

Folks bitching about air conditioned Amazon warehouse jobs that pay in my area to start a “dystopian future”?  

Their definition of being “mistreated” usually means getting to work on time and doing the work as expected.  Then they want machines to do the work, and are surprised when that means less jobs."
2,"> See, exploitation shouldn't be allowed under law.

Generally it isn't.  An objective view of exploitation is a bit different than what you seem to think it is.

In the US.  I've done it twice."
0,"If i understand you correctly, the problem with  1. seem more of a social issue than economic issue.
And with 2. has it been calculated before? I only know of interviews with andrea yang, who claimed the maths works if you eventually begin to tax filthy large companies like amazon and the likes.
I do not have a clue, but from my lofe experience i learnt that it is worth it to aim high and land somewhat lower.

Tl;dr is it really doomed? Why not give it a try?"
2,"The values of the house probably not by much if they do. But there will be a lot more houses on the market with foreclosures and people moving as they get new jobs or lose current ones. In 2020 no one could really move and start new jobs except for small number of cases. 2021 we see people start trying to get back to normal and we have shortages left and right which causes a supply and demand effect making my home 40% more valuable than it was the previous year. As more homes are on the market the supply goes up to meet the demand again so we could see a 5%-10% drop in value. 

Im not a financial expert by any means tho. Just some idiot on Reddit."
2,Probably gonna stabilize but a lot of foreclosures now that they can evict
2,"You gave me a tough job today, man. I like you.

While I appreciate your admission here (truly I do), we cannot allow your behavior here. If you truly want to engage us, do so without venting at us. We are not your enemy and your ideas might indeed be wrong, but you won't find out if they are and you won't imporve them if you just treat people like shit.

I do apologize, but I have to ban you. I will make it temporary, but it will be pretty long because you don't seem to be a Republican. Seriously though, I do appreciate that you realize what you are doing and seem somewhat remorseful about it. I seek to be more like Jesus, too. It can be really fucking hard, but it's worth it.

God loves you, man.

I strongly suggest reading the Gospel of John and Acts to see what Jesus teaches. It is so on point with what I am absolutely sure you believe to be moral, that you might even see that he's calling to you. All you have to do after that is ask him into your heart and believe he has been raised.

I hope to hear that you have accepted him into your life soon, he's already accepted you."
0,"I don't think that able bodied people of sound mind should be assisted unless they need assistance.  Someone who lost their job last year when most businesses were shutting down needed assistance.

Someone who is out of work because they choose to not work, does not need assistance, they need a swift kick in the rump.

Many of the homeless are not of sound mind.  We need to go back to putting these people in asylums where they can be cared for, rather than leaving them on the street."
1,Look up LBJ’s war on poverty we’ve been trying at it for going on 50 years now but the poverty rate has barely changed so giving people welfare doesn’t seem to be the answer
1,"Yes and we have dumped trillions at this problem and it never gets better. 

So your answer is to poor more money at it.  Government can’t solve this it’s not in their best interest"
1,"That is hopelessly optimistic. And almost immediately debunked by the current labor shortage. You remove the fear of eviction and supplement their income than nobody works. Because social welfare temporarily eclipsed what they could make by actually working. The greater the social welfare received by all the more people will be affected. If given the option most would rather settle than work for additional benefits. 

The real kicker is the less people work the more expensive basic goods would become. Since they need to encourage people to work who otherwise don't need too. The new cost of living would require an increase in social welfare provided creating a cycle until provider just gives up. The only solution here would be to mandate people work or directly assign them which kind of defeats the purpose of your above scenario."
1,Or what the tipping point is for other people to be so angry and disincentivized that they stop working. Which is a separate problem than the straight math of it.
2,Well I live in Alaska and we do have a permanent fund dividend that we get once a year that comes from taxes paid by oil companies but the thing is we only get $1000-$2000 so it’s not enough to live off and plus since Alaska has a small population were able to give it but if you took a bigger state like Michigan where my dad grew up the dividend would only be like $25 a person.
0,"So, anecdotally it's easy to make a company. Perfect. Let me gather my vast funding and do so. 

Nothing is objective about exploitation, my friend. Exploitation happens between at least two people, with one of them believing it's not exploitation. That's very subjective. 

I can tell you that the folks believe that extracting profit from a laborer is exploitation, and that's why they hate working in the current system.

It's not fulfilling to have your boss take upwards of 80% of the money you make for them. I can attest to that. Quite frankly, it's soul crushing. It shouldn't be fulfilling to have a bunch of *people* laboring *for* you. That's some kingpin bullshit. If you want to be king of the castle so badly, go play chess, instead of literally exploiting people for your own personal gain."
0,"Dude you’re not understanding what I’m saying. People who work 40 hours aren’t as valuable as people who work 100, obviously. I am trying to put across that people want to make a few more dollars an hour and not get treated like shit, but you seem to be too proud of throwing years of your life away working in a flawed system to understand that you, along with everyone else except the elite, are getting fucked"
1,"> If i understand you correctly, the problem with 1. seem more of a social issue than economic issue.

No, its economic.  The amount Yang was talking about was $1000 per month, and Yang was talking about getting people off welfare by moving them to UBI.  Very few people can live off $12,000 per year, so they'd still need to have another source of income.  Nobody would voluntarily switch from welfare to UBI - they make far more on welfare - and if forced, they would riot.  So we're talking about UBI *in addition to* welfare.

> And with 2. has it been calculated before?

328 million people times $1000 per month is $4 trillion per year - which just happens to be about the same as our total Federal revenues.  It would leave nothing left to pay for the rest of government.  Even getting rid of welfare would just reduce the amount of programs you can't pay for.

> is it really doomed? Why not give it a try?

It is really doomed.  It has been tried, and the effects were exactly what conservatives warned about.  If the amount was high enough to live on, not only was it even less affordable, people simply stopped working."
2,"Then again, sometimes the banks choose not to foreclose. I know somebody that lost their business around 09 and they just stopped paying their mortgage. The bank did everything in their power to not foreclose. Not because they wanted to be nice, but because the bank would have been under water on the house too. The bank even paid the property tax and didn't evict or foreclose on her for over five years."
2,Just report these trolls and move on.
0,No. No you didn't. 'Trillions' have been spent to keep homeless people out of view. Very little of this money has been spent on actually helping the homeless
2,Seriously. Neither of those articles provide support for your “Biden is importing illegal aliens to fill jobs”.
2,"The truth is we all base decisions of marginal utility all the time. Ceteris Parabus, who would work if they could make $500k a year without working?

Simply put, people only do things that they perceive as being “worth the Every person has different values placed in different/their own time… the better you make life without work, the fewer people will decide that the juice (extra is with the squeeze (time+effort)."
0,"The labor shortage is caused by much more than just people not wanting to work. More than half a million people are dead now, and many of those were ""essential"" workers such as cooks and fast food workers, which is where we are mainly seeing the labor shortage. Covid has also made restaurants and other labor providers have shorter hours, reduced dine in capacity, and as a result they are providing less benefits to people. 

If you had to work and still not have enough to eat or have benefits vs not work and still not eat or have benefits, why would you work?"
2,"That's closer to a tax break than UBI, though. In order to be UBI, it would have to be enough to live off of, and as far as I know most pilot projects either give very little or only to a small group of people, which doesn't really study any of the effects we would be interested in seeing in relation to a larger economy and work culture shift."
2,"Agree, unlikely near term - at least a decade a way - lots of work on AI, machine learning, genetic algos, vision recognition, neural processing, etc that might change that - but it's probably going to take at least a decade or two to mainstream at scale

Good news is that the rise of the ""citizen programmer"" and code tools will likely end up building such a mound of utterly brittle crap that it ends up sucking a lot of business resources to demolish and rebuild things 🤣🤣🤣"
2,That’s a very unique situation. That’s very fortunate for your friend as well. Do you mind giving me some more info? Was this a small local bank or a big bank? And after 5 years did the bank finally foreclose?
1,"Trillions spent on section 8 housing, on programs to make education cheaper.

1,"So why do you think he's allowing in twice as many illegals as have ever come in before?  Keep in mind, the border patrol only catches between a third and half of those who come across the border, so we'll get something on the order of 6 million this year.

...and do you think employers who can't get Americans to take their jobs will turn up their noses at illegal aliens who will work for less, when the Federal government will turn a blind eye?"
1,"Not to belittle a tragedy but the people killed by covid make up an extremely small percentage of the population. The US is home to over 328 million people. Total cases over the entire pandemic is only 40 million. The covide death toll is absolutely not responsible for the labor shortage. 

To provide an example where a large event did cause some labor problems look at WW1. The war depopulated entire villages, but even that was due in large part to poor conscription and assignment practices. It saw around 20 million dead spread across Europe and other participating nations.

The black death also caused some labor shortages, but again it killed way more people. Estimated around 25 million.

The problems you cited above are a result of not having enough people to staff the restaurant. They are unable to function at full capacity with only a skeleton crew assuming they even have enough people to open in the first place. The solution is to bump wages, but many small businesses can't afford it without also bumping prices or corporations who just don't want to."
2,"Dude there are over 10 million unfilled positions right now, and a big percentage of Covid deaths were retired."
2,Exactly I would agree it’s closer to a tax break or a tax refund. Because again you can’t live off of it. And plus the money comes from taxes paid by the oil companies because the Alaska constitution says the resources belong to the people so instead of government sending you a 55 gallon barrel of oil they send you some money
2,"I would argue that it’s better to hold real assets (eg house) during an economic crash rather than having the cash. During a crash there will be inflation, so your cash will be worth less, but a house will still have inherent value. Please share your thoughts on this because I’m not sure if this is correct."

2,And they supposably want to hand out another 2k to almost everyone. What good is giving away money if it's worthless because of the inevitable hyper uncrease in inflation.
1,"It's stealing from those of us with savings rather than debt, and those who are retired.  So as usual, punishing success and rewarding failure."
2,"How is this stealing from those with savings and the retired?? Seniors will be taken care of in this bill, and I understand the ultra wealthy will be a tax break.. these are good things right?"
2,"When the government spends this massive an amount of money, they are borrowing or conjuring up money in some way.  Those dollars now compete with our dollars in the market for the same goods.  Supply of money is up, demand for goods is up due to government spending, leading to of the dollars in people's savings and retirement funds.   Those in or near retirement are typically on fixed incomes or invested in less volatile, lower return assets such that they can't keep up with high inflation.  Those in the workforce and earlier in thier investing years are invested in riskier assets who's return is more likely keep up with inflation and in theory their wages rise with inflation (in theory...). In any case, every dollar you have is worth less, and every dollar you have borrowed and spent is also worth less.  Reducing your effective debt if you're in the red, but harming your savings if you are not.

The ultra wealthy primary have money in corporations whos assets and value are pretty well hedged against inflation.  It won't harm them, it'll mostly harm middle to upper-middle class."
1,"So, what is the avenue of change that limits our government from the u.s. dollar? Government spending and tax breaks for the ultra rich seems to be a problem that we have to deal with.  Spending money on needles wars that go to the military industrial complex seems to be a moot point in all this. How can we get rid of special interests stealing from normal folks? Do we not target corporate interests in how they do business in the U.S. and beyond? Shall we make folks like Bezos and Musk pay more taxes to offset this spiral?"
2,"If you took 200 billion from Bezos and just handed it out to all US citizens, it would be about $600 per person, one-time.  It wouldn't change anything drastically.  The scale of government spending is so far beyond the ultra wealthy it's obscene.  My point is the ultra wealthy are not the problem or the solution.  They're an inevitable result of a global economy in my view.  They aren't necessarily evil or good, but one thing that's pretty universal is that they have changed the world on a global scale.

The exception to the above being when special interests and lobbyists are pushing policy not in our best interest with billionaire dollars driving policy.  We used to call that corruption or at least a conflict of interest or ethics violation.

I have no idea how to fix it, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, so hold my beer:

1) Remove the power and money from DC by drastically decreasing federal spending and returning power to the states.  I'm thinking decentralization of this power makes it harder to corrupt and more accountable to the people.

2) Cryptocurrency may be a game changer.  I'm sure with its own set of unforseen consequences.


I don't know what the numbers are currently, but Biden was proposing something like 10 trillion in spending over the coming years.  For my household, of which, I'm the only income earner, if we naively just divide 10 trillion by 330 million citizens, then multiple by the number in my household, that's about 150,000 the government is spending of my earnings, on my behalf.  The reality is worse, because the bottom 50% aren't effectively paying federal income tax (though of course they pay other taxes).  I'm sorry, I have better things to spend on than supporting bloated, inefficient government.  That's only proposed new federal spending, I already pay property tax, sales tax, gas tax (presumably for 'infrastructure'), local income tax, state income tax, medicare, social security, and the corporate taxes, etc built into the good we buy.

All things considered, the bureaucrats are probably really close to controlling more of the wealth we produce than we are.  I am not against all taxes, but the way I see it the bureaucracy in DC is effectively a parasite which is bleeding us dry with debt and wasteful spending.  I don't know where all that money goes, but I'm certain obscene amounts are being wasted or even being spent on causes directly opposed to the interests of the citizens paying for this mess."

1,"Fauci was well aware that specific research into bat cornovirus was taking place at the Wuhan Virology Institute. He specifically approved funding of this type of research. Yet, early in the pandemic he pushed the line that the virus spontaneously popped up in a wet market in the same frigging city where they were studying this specific thing. 

He knew, he lied, and he may very well have been the cause of the entire massive catastrophe that COVID19 and will forever be.  It's not a stretch to make this claim. 

It is entirely possible that the man who was instrumental causing the deaths of over 4.5 million people and the loss of trillions of dollars in economic activity is in fact the same man that is being celebrated as a hero by people like Trevor Noah, John Oliver and others. In fact, there appears to be solid evidence to this.

Someone needs to ask him why he pushed the story that COVID 19 developed in nature when he was very well aware that research into that specific type of very unique virus was being funded by the NIH in the city where the virus originated."

They’ve promoted him as a sort of God-like figure who isn’t to be questioned.   They’ve bashed you and called you a conspiracy theorist crockpot for daring to question him.  

DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO QUIETLY DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM DR FAUCI.   They need to be constantly reminded that the man they put on a pedestal is one of the main reasons we have this virus unleashed upon the world.   Every Democrat you know needs to be confronted with this."

2,"? I have all sorts of flags that I put up depending on what we are learning. Don’t tread on me… Soviet Union … nazi flag… Texas independence flag …. 

I feel like this is half a story. What other things were in the room ? I’m guessing a US flag and all sorts of things the parente approve of. And heaven forbid the teacher have some sort of activity where the kids have to self reflect on their own beliefs. 

I’m sad to watch republicanism become the party of censorship and identifying “wrong think” so many of us talk about the participation trophy ruining achievement (it did) but here we are. Angry cus someone doesn’t do something the way you want. 
 

I hear “indoctrination” all the time but really What that means is people want kids indoctrinated with THEIR viewpoints. Heaven forbid a kid is introduced to Both perspectives. 
Tax paid classroom. Pls. Taxes paid for the 4 walls. The teacher paid for everything else in the damn room.

2,There's an endless number of businesses looking for employees. People should have been getting a job long before.
1,"7 million people that sat around for a year.  Who wants to hire that lazy sack.  Millions busted their asses through the entire pandemic and made less money than the people leeching off our tax dollars.  In 9 months that will be an additional 7 million people on welfare.  With high wages, increased taxes, huge inflation on cost of goods all because of the current Marxist, authoritarian regime running this country, how many jobs will be around in a couple of months with 7 million people earning less than what they received in handouts.  Don’t forget to add rent to the equation.  The moratorium is over.  I hope I’m wrong, but I have a negative outlook on this economy."
1,"Yeah, Amazon is always hiring billions of people!  Stores are paying $20.00 an hour for unskilled labor.  How can 7 million  people be so lazy and still be able to sleep at night?"
1,"> 7 million people that sat around for a year. Who wants to hire that lazy sack. 

This is something I said early on.  If I'm a hiring manager and someone comes in looking for a job who last worked in February 2020, they had better have an explanation other than ""Unemployment paid more than working"" for why, or I won't touch them with a 10 foot pole."
1,"How could anyone hire someone that hasn’t workforce a year and a half?  I can’t imagine how demotivated an individual that literally did nothing for 18 months.  How will they wake up every morning ready to go to work?  

What I love most is the complete 180 the unions took to defend union members that do not want to take the vaccine.  The teachers union spent over a year telling the public how vaccines and masks are the key to open schools, now they want to fight against vaccine mandates.

These leftist clowns always implode on their own policies and ideology.  Defund the police , no don’t fund the police.  We need vaccines, no vaccine mandate.  1996 Biden, we need to lock up these animals, 2021 Biden, institutional racism.  Turn of the 20th century Democrats, Jim Crow laws and KKK, 1960s Democrats welfare, 2020s Democrats equity and everything is racist.  Nothing they say is true.  It’s all rhetoric.  They don’t even believe the BS they are pandering to the poor.  They are Marxist, authoritarian  and now cultural imperialist by controlling how will live, what to believe and censorship.  It’s all party first and centralize power to a federal , single party system.

They don’t want anyone to have their individual freedom or the right to pursuit happiness.  They want people on government programs.  Those in the middle get to pay for it because any bit of success is due to systemic racism."

1,"I want to push back in the idea that the Dems are outright hemorrhaging minorities.  I think it's important to qualify what's going on here with minorities starting to vote republican. 

Let's look at the 2020 election. The Trump campaign made significant investments in reaching specific minority communities eg. Tejanos in TX, American Indians in NC, and black men in general.

With the first two, the Trump campaign used messaging that spoke specifically  to those groups. Acknowledging their history, and issues specific to them. In contrast the Dems reached out to those groups as members of the ""BIPOC"" Community. The idea of BIPOC people as a group was created by the left and is defined by their ""shared oppression"". This allowed Trump to win groups which republicans never won.

Trump was able to blunt the Dem edge with black men both through his personal appeal and superior messaging. Saying, if I'm president the economy will be so good you can get rich. But again the Dems just lumped them under the BIPOC label and told them if you like trump you're not black.

In conclusion Trump was able to either blunt the Dem edge or win outright with specific minority groups by tailoring messaging for those groups and giving them an optimistic as opposed to a pessimistic message.  The takeaway is that Trump's approach is replicable and useful, but requires significant investments in crafting proper messaging and finding the right groups to target."
2,Biden recently put some visa restriction on people involved in the current genocide against the Tirgray and Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia. There's currently debate around a house resolution(H.R 445) to formally condemn Ethiopia and Eretria for genocide and crimes against humanity. Pompeo and Inhofe are lobbying on behalf of the Ethiopian and Eritrean government in opposition to Biden and most of congress.
1,"Great question. Sorry for not including information (this is something that is practically common knowledge in my circle - apologies)

See [

Also Twitter is a good metric as well [ 

Currently there is 0 coverage from MSM - in fact any coverage is anti-Ethiopia pro-interventionist (akin to Libya).

Here are some sources to why I thanked Senator Jim Inhofe & Sec. Pompeo.

* [Jim Inhofe](
* [Mike Pompeo]("
2,"The sad fact is that the narrative of ""Tigray Genocide""  has successfully reached the international audience, despite the facts on the ground.

* Cause of war was the Nov 4th attack by the TPLF (Tigray People's Liberation Front) - the ousted former ruling party of Ethiopia for over 30 years (BAD DUDES).
* Amharas have been ethnically cleansed from many areas  (Wollega, Mai Kadra, Chena, Agmasa, etc...)
* TPLF using Child Soldiers to continue their crusade in Afar & Amhara regions.

Yet TPLF has rebranded it's name (in name only) to TDF)and cries genocide while killing civilians of all ethnicities (Crocodile tears). 

In Ethiopia, there are 80+ ethnicities. Yet, TPLF (The Tigray Rebels) are literally the only faction which is actually using ethnicity as a target - yet you probably don't hear these narratives."
2,The MSM has [posted]( about the atrocities committed in Ethiopia.
1,"I haven't came across this NPR article - thanks for correcting my hyperbole.

Most outlets that reaches our circle Amnesty International, CNN, NYTimes, BBC, & The Telegraph has reported one sided stories that coverup or sympathize with the TPLF (the aggressor) by appealing to their ethnic base despite them even targeting their own who disagree.

Let me just give you a glimpse to what I'm referring to:

* NYTimes + Senator Coons makeup stories to blame the Ethiopian PM as cause.
   * [
* The Telegraph jumping through hoops to blame Ethiopians of Genocide.
   * [

There is so so so much more - if you know an Ethiopian talk to them and they'll tell you. At the moment MSM isn't reporting the facts (at best cherry picking & downplaying). I'll be doing my best to TLDR the series of events - I'm just one dude trying to clear the misinformation.

Seriously talk to an Ethiopian. Ask them about news coverage. Ask them about the Democratic Party & Biden. If what I say is a lie you'll see it reflected in their words.

Promise I'll centralize all the info. Currently, misdeeds are lost in Tweets & Local News - this shit is much deeper than they tell you."
1,I have a coworker who’s not from Ethiopia but her parents are. The way she tells it is that it started out as basically a group wanting their own freedom and then the bigger government coming in and squashing the attempts. So the little guys started taking hostages and killing civilians Vietnam style and then big government started ethnic cleansing. Basically just sounds fucked up all around.
2,"Unfortunately, you'll hear 2 stories and it's mostly divided on ethnic lines and allegiance.

If they're from Tigray (most likely but not universal) will tell you that story you shared.

Ethiopia has 80+ Ethnicities, but one political group (from Tigray) is trying to make a comeback after being ousted from power - after 30 years of being the ruling party. The TPLF is not a small guy - it's literally a political group that has used Racism to divide Ethiopia.

TPLF's aim is to make itself look like the good guy using it's operatives across the world. They are a rich & extremely corrupt group that got the boot due to a popular uprising.

Democracy has emerged; and ethno nationalism (their bread & butter) is under threat.

Imagine having the US dividing states based on ethnic lines (like This is for Whites Only, This is for Blacks Only, etc...) That's who they are... racism is a political opinion in their mind :)

Here's a joke

* Republican talks about race... they're a racist
* TPLF kills, borders & imprisons based on race... they're a fledgling democracy
* ^ That truly happened (Susan Rice & Barack Obama said that) ["

The only thing Biden has been doing for COVID is doling out the vaccines Trump had made, and trying to set up vaccine passports so minorities can't participate in the economy."
2,No lol it’s all media. All companies. All politicians. All subreddits etc. if they support the person then what they do wrong gets swept under the rug for the blame gets pushed to someone else. Iv seen it here plenty with random republicans. I see it over in every day.
2,The one he provided a bit of support to develop yet somehow his followers seem very prone to believe strange conspiracy theories about. Perhaps it would of helped if had started to actively promote it back in January when he secretly took the jab?  Maybe?  Possibly?
2,Sure absolutely…not disagreeing with you there. But I believe journalism has a huge responsibility on being unbiased and truthful and saying what needs to be said. But….you’re right….lol they all suck.
0,"Such an echo chamber in here. I remember when the Republican Party actually had values, but sadly it seems the decades of mind-numbing propaganda has changed your brains to mush. As void of any principles as the 2020 platform."

This is a place for Republicans to discuss issues with other Republicans. To those visiting this thread, we ask that unless you identify as Republican that you refrain from commenting and leave the vote button alone. Non republicans who come to our sub looking for a 'different perspective' subvert that very perspective with their own views when they vote or comment."
2,"I understand this is for Republicans, but are you going to excluding the type of Republicans who actually have values and live partially in reality, or is this just for people who want to relive the greatest hits of Trump and replay all of the episodes of Fox News propaganda?

I am old enough to remember Bush Jr working together with Fauci to make a massive impact on AIDS in Africa. I am old enough to remember Bush Sr working towards a balanced budget since he felt deficit spending was deeply immoral. I am old enough to remember Reagan standing against authoritarian governments. I am not quite old enough,  but vaguely remember that Lincoln guy who fought *against* the Confederates in the Civil War. 

Gone is any desire for a smaller government and gone is any desire to have candidates that have a shred of personal character or stand up against authoritarian dictatorships such as Russia and N Korea."
2,The man is a damned disgrace. A national embarrassment.
1,You call that a president we call him joe biden
1,Biden is a piece of shit on a napkin
2,Yep. They celebrate a lifelong societal parasite but disrespect heroes who defend our country.
2,im 48 years old he is by far the worse world leader ive ever known

can you believe people still support this guy? 😞"
1,He’s kneeling because he fantasizes about being the cop that did it.
1,Dems are the most spiteful obstinate group of reckless and morally corrupt people. All they want is to devastate the core foundations of decency all because someone they courted back in the early 2000s decided to not play ball with them and instead ran as their opposition. The strategy is to convey ineptitude and all the negatives they couldn’t pin on 45 during this potato regime. They embody all the worse they criticize in others. A self licking ice cream cone.
2,"Hero of the loser left: bottom right, though both men pictured are criminals."

2,A literal nothing burger. Let's stop doing to Biden what they did to Trump.
2,"It saddens me when people resolve to personal attacks, berating, calling names... It's really not a productive way to debate our differences. I'm sorry to see such response, when all I wanted was to express my opinions.

Well, what can you do?"
1,Finally someone beats Jimmy Carter as the most worthless President in history although they both agreed that Middle East oil costs to much but there’s nothing we can do unless we hire someone more Trump-Like to take over for ole Joe.
2,"He did that as well when asked to speak about and that goes back 20 years. Checked his watch and said while he was answering questions post-speech that ""I'll take one more but I have to get outta here."" He has no soul, no conscience. It's all about Joe yet Joe is no longer all there."
0,And you've *never* committed any type of faux pas I assume?  The last handful of republican presidents have their fair share of them....  Have you ever been at a bar to watch a football game and didn't support the troops by not standing for the Televised national anthem?  Let they who is without sin cast the first stone
2,I think you mean drug addicted loser that threatened to shoot a pregnant woman in the belly that got caught trying to pass fake money to a store owner that wanted to fight with the police and became a hero. Wtf
2,"Simply my take, but Tik Tok is used for spying on people and collecting their personal private data. I don't think any military-related things should be documented on that nasty app."
2,when I was in we were told we can’t use it in places that require clearance. That was it really.
1,Express your opinions on sloppy Joe here is the red carpet
1,"if your sad over a druggie woman abuser  criminal , you have issues, Floyd was a vile ..trash.. person find someone else to feel sorry for , how about real victims, like Ashli Babbitt?, or does she not count cause she is white?"
1,"Why?  The third picture was him virtue signaling kneeling for the loser in the fourth picture, like the rest of the leftist dumbasses"
2,"Sadly, not an American citizen myself. I'm sorry to criticize your president, but I found his actions repulsive. I really don't care if he was a Republican or Democrat, it's irrelevant. What is relevant, however, are his actions."
1,"> Have you ever been at a bar to watch a football game and didn't support the troops by not standing for the Televised national anthem?

Right, because that's remotely in the same ballpark. Biden got these people killed, then couldn't be bothered to show an ounce of decorum for the 45 minute ceremony. He then went on to roll his eyes at the mother of one of the dead marines, among other things, and wouldn't shut up about his own son."
1,"Haha seriously? You have the Commander in Chief and hes checking the time instead of respecting the fallen soldiers of his FAILED PLAN. Yes, President Trump was going to evacuate the troops but sleepy Joe had no plan. He fucked up, he disrespected the fallen soldiers for making sure it wasnt time to take his dementia medication. Joe is a joke."
1,"In this case, those people were dead explicitly because of the actions he took.  Had he followed Trump's plan, we'd have been out of the country months before that attack occurred."
2,"Officer had to stand his ground. Gave plenty of warning not to enter cross that doorway. I fell very sorry for Ashley’s family but the force the officer used was justified in this case. 

In the case of Floyd. It’s well documented that he should not have used that amount of force. Digging up someone’s past to try and justify it after the fact doesn’t work."
0,Ignorant statements like that are the reason a lot of centrist think this sub and Republicans are racist. I hope you realize how wrong you are one day.
2,3rd picture is him doing a cringe kneel only for political points. Not because he actually cares about the situation.
2,"If you're not an American, frankly, I don't give a damn.  If you haven't been living under a rock you'd understand that this was a forever war and nobody was going to pull out perfectly.  20 years, hundreds of thousands of lives lost, yet all you care to critique are the few thousand people warned to leave that didn't and 12 of the thousands of soldiers that have already died?  The entire last decade was a disgrace and you can scrutinize the actions of the last 3 presidents but *this one* ooooh this one really screwed the pooch?  Grow up"
1,"Oh, adding in extras to move the goalposts?  The initial critique was a still image, which in sure you'll agree are extremely easily taken out of context... honestly I'm my opinion you and I and every American got those soldiers killed, along with the thousands of other US soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Afghan soldiers that have died over the last two decades for supporting this war not just in the first place but along the way.  There was *never* going to be a clean pull out no matter who was in office. Period. 

The difference here is that Sundowning Irish Joe (or likely the people around him) saw that he doesn't seem to care or realize there's an election coming up so they ended it."
1,"Your argument re: Babbitt would be correct, IF she had actually crossed through the doorway - she had not, he shot her THROUGH the doorway and she fell on the other side of the door because she had not crossed through at that point

Home owners have been prosecuted for shooting through the doorway at someone attempting to crash through their door - there is fear, but insufficient fear of imminent death or great bodily harm as long as the aggressor is on the OTHER side of the door (like Babbitt)"
2,He was a junkie who robbed a pregnant woman by holding a gun to her belly. We'd be calling him a total pos no matter what color they are. Stop being stupid
2,Politicians made a movie out of him
1,"The Dumbocrats don't care about ANYONE except themselves - sure, it's virtue signaling for political brownie points - doesn't make it any less vile"
2,"> If you're not an American, frankly, I don't give a damn. 

Maybe you forgot that it wasn't only American troops fighting in Afghanistan. Coalition forces had soldiers from many other nations. For example the British had close to 500 dead, the Italians 100ish, etc etc (and many more were wounded and will most likely suffer the consequences of that for the rest of their lives). You're spitting on their graves with that statement. Have a modicum of empathy, for fuck's sake."
2,"I sense hostility. No need for that.

We need to clear a couple of things: first, this is not about the war in Afghanistan as a whole. Second, this is not about drawing comparisons between Biden and the last three presidents, it's about this one particular instance.

I understand why my opinion may not matter to you, because this is your country, not mine. And I respect that. I have always respected Americans for their patriotism.

It's also absolutely fine to discuss different opinions. Mine, for instance, is that an American president should be more mindful of his behavior. Yours may be different.

Let's come together, and in words of Joe Biden during his inauguration speech, ""We can treat each other with dignity and respect""."
2,"Yeah,  because it's not like there were blockades and checkpoints preventing Americans from leaving right?"
2,Another thing I forgot to add. Shooting through a closed door isn’t the same as a police officer defending congressmen as they evacuate the building. Seems like we have slightly different views but I really appreciate you keeping it light as opposed to immediately name calling and cursing like a lot of folks do
2,But we are the racists they are the communist Marxist
2,Just because I don’t believe the same thing you do doesn’t make me a liberal. You’re welcome to review my comment history I’m on here a lot. I just keep call out people the few times I feel it’s necessary
2,"The blockades that prevented Americans from getting through were at the airport gate and staffed by the US military.

What is preventing 6 planeloads of people - including Americans - from leaving right now, is the US State Department."
2,Case law has been consistent - until the aggressor is actually on the other side of a doorway and capable of presenting real imminent threat - it's not justified to shoot
1,"Except there were in fact no congressmen in the building - it had already been emptied when this happened

Recall that AOC was in a completely different building - later claiming she had to hide in her bathroom because people were going to her - even though there was absolutely no one there"
1,I lost my lunatic-lefty cherry back at the end of 2015
2,">   The initial critique was a still image,  which in sure you'll agree are extremely easily taken out of context

To

> To critique the comment you brought in additional evidence 

So you both want to dismiss the image for having no context, then whine about someone introducing additional context? That's... an interesting take.

> you brought in additional evidence that was not part of the initial argument, moving the goal posts.

Kudos for showing you can read but not comprehend, and are so lacking understanding that you think introducing evidence in a debate is a logical fallacy. That's absolutely precious."
2,"I just rewatched the video again. 



I’m not going to pretend I have any knowledge whatsoever about case law or anything castle doctrine. I’m just a guy on Reddit. 

What I see is a justified shooting. Since the officer was cleared of the shooting I’m guessing others thought that as well."
2,"This is a statement from Chief of Police following that day 

“As protesters were forcing their way toward the House Chamber where Members of Congress were sheltering in place, a sworn USCP employee discharged their service weapon, striking an adult female.  Medical assistance was rendered immediately, and the female was transported to the hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries.  She has been identified as Ashli Babbitt.”"
2,Yeah I do know about the AOC thing. But I’m under the impression that there were a few reps In the “gallery of House of Representatives” is that not in the same building?
2,"This isn't castle doctrine related - the only issue in situation like this is whether the cop had a legitimate fear for IMMINENT death or great bodily harm - in the process or climbing through a window isn't there yet - imminence doesn't accrue until the person is on your side of the door and in a position to cause imminent harm

Officer was ""cleared"" of the shooting by the Capitol Hill police - of course he was

That's like the Chicago Police having initially cleared the dumbass who illegally shot that Laquan McDonald buffoon"
0,What threat did an unarmed woman pose to an armed secret service officer. He could have fired a warning shot or he could have moved to arrest her when she came through the window. There was also a swat team at babits rear coming up the stairs which I imagine had contact via radio with the shooter. You can see them signal eachother with a thumbs up after the shot
2,"The standard CYA statement - like the CPD tried in the McDonald (and a lot of other) cases

They were ""sheltering in place"" in a completely OTHER building - video that was shown of the chamber at the time shows it was empty"
2,"> in the process or climbing through a window isn't there yet - imminence doesn't accrue until the person is on your side of the door and in a position to cause imminent harm

Particularly given that there was a second door between them."
2,"People who’s job is to decide whether lethal force or not is authorized chose to acquit the officer. I’m going to side with them. 

You also just used the exact same argument that the loved ones of Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, and countless others have used. Did you defend them the same way?"

That made the Admiral unhappy because no plutonium = no big booms."

That being said, it's been far easier for me as a nuclear advocate to convince a right winger to support nuclear power than to have a left winger support nuclear.

The left bludgeoned the right with emotional appeal and NIMBYism to shut down our stance on nuclear in the general public, meaning that the only options left if you knew solar and wind wouldn't do anything would be to either be silent and keep voting... Or throw your hands in the air. It's so easy to bring right wing republicans who don't believe in climate change back to believing in reasonable stances on environmentalism as long as A) it's incremental and B) you validate their concerns. Same thing I've done with most topics.

And, to be honest, if the right says don't spend money and not solve the problem, and the left says spend more money on something that won't solve the problem... I think not spending money is still a better option.

It's so irritating if you look at it and see how the the nuclear regulatory commission called a lot of the anti nuclear attacks ""leftist trash"" all the way back in the 80s. If they let us keep going we would have been like France and this wouldn't have been an issue."

The problem with don't spend money and don't solve the problem is no steps are being made towards solving the problem. Not saying spending money is great, but it can at least create progress to a solution if well managed.

Now whether you think the left can manage it well is of course a valid concern... I also believe government is wasteful and stupid in many situations after all."
2,"To be fair, I’m somewhat left leaning and super into nuclear.  It’s not a lost cause.  I actually find a lot of the older more conservative men who don’t know much about nuclear are the ones still quite nervous about it!"
2,"Hey man, in this polarized time I'm happy to find common ground. One of my best friends since I moved to GA is a traditional auth left guy, and when we have to talk politics that's our common ground we loop back to.

It is true both sides have their derps, we just need to reel them in. I remember being 'shut down' by someone on the left calling me a climate change denier because I said renewables can't fill our energy needs.

And I get that nothing is being done if you do nothing... But sometimes if you're given two shitty options I'd rather we do the least shitty one. 

As an example, let's say we told two people to each pick up a cinder block and carry it 100m east. If one person is fiddling with the block and then walking 30m south, and the other is kind of sitting there... That would mean the person sitting there is putting us in a better position.  That's how I view it; if we spend ungodly sums of money in renewable tech that won't solve the problem were essentially wasting money. Don't get me wrong, I think the gov should be, in general, supporting tech advancements... But we need to prioritize. If we took half the renewable funds and gave it to the scientists and engineers trying to make  nuclear stations cheaper or faster to construct, it would have actually made a dent.

Cheers to finding common ground, from a right winger to a left winger!"
1,"Not to keep pointing fingers back and forth, but the resistance to nuclear power really is a primarily left-wing phenomenon in politics. The sooner we all get behind it though, the better!"
2,I could see why. Nuclear is a clean and reliable power source but accidents do happen
2,"Yep, you guys just also have to work on your older conservative ally’s that really only have poor knowledge of the (mostly man made) disasters of the past.  People like me will work the left. 
Most libs I know are in favour of a *diverse* energy economy.  More wind, yes. More solar, yes. Nuclear additions, yes. nationally refined oil products, yes.  Not everyone left wing is ultra progressive, just like not everyone right wing is alt-right extreme. There’s a middle ground somewhere with a lot of overlap on these issues."
2,"In the documentaries I’ve watched, the ‘major’ accidents have been due to negligence.   I’m definitely open to links citing otherwise, however, it’s my understanding that Chernobyl for example was a direct result of plant management ignoring power source protocols and straight up causing an avoidable disaster (trying to cover it up obviously didn’t help) and 3 mile island for another example, was the result of a leak that was not registered by any sort of sensor or properly maintained and was an entirely avoidable incident in itself as well.  Sadly, communication technology wasn’t at the level it has been at for the last couple decades to lead to faster, more experienced troubleshooting either.  Both examples are tragic and damaging to the psyche, but, when studied, the argument of how dangerous they are lessens as the argument for human error grows."
2,"Exactly. I was literally just watching a Chernobyl technical documentary last night and it explained what happened and why. The engineers allowed the nuclear reactor to enter an unstable state without realizing what had happened, and then had pulled too many control rods out causing the reactor to overheat and explode"

1,"No it doesn't. Nor does it have to have ""exceptions for life of the mother"" either. The latter is the only possibly compelling exception and even then it falls flat on its face because in no other realm is failure to medically save (in this case the baby) applicable to murder. 

You cannot fail to save with malice aforethought and despite taking every reasonable action still murder the person. That's just nonsense because the malice aforethought part is contradictory to the actions trying to save another. Doctors aren't perfect and fail to save people all the time and it's not murder. So why would it be any different for the unborn child that you suggest abortion be legal so that they can be killed? It doesn't make sense. Either the child is going to die regardless what you do and you can save the mother, or the child lives and the mother lives.

So no, the law doesn't need to make any exceptions for this. If you murder the child, you should be punished. Period."

1,"They still won't get the court packing. They know they'll lose big time if they pack the court. They're already up against the redistricting and the increased security against exploiting mail in voting in several of the swing states they used to put Biden in, the first midterm after a president's first term is the hardest to maintain for the president's party and the president is already in hot water with the whole Afghanistan debacle. Plus if Harris gets 25thed into the white house between now and then, it's even worse because everybody will be coming out to stop her. That's why Biden only did the commission instead of just nominating new justices. Also Pelosi's commission isn't really moving very well. Even the social media platforms, facebook included are starting to regret propping up the democrats because now they want to come after them with regulations not to make them uphold free speech which they were afraid of under Trump, but to censor more than they can handle without hurting their bottom line. Add to that people's weariness with the pandemic and the flipflopping of government officials on what actions need to be taken to mitigate COVID and it looks less and less good for the Democrats.

1,"That's because it doesn't actually have to. Failing to save an unborn baby because we're unable to do so is not abortion. That's a miscarriage, even if facilitated by surgery to remove the child from a fallopian tube. The child is guaranteed to die in that case and so it's not murder to save the mother's life by removing the child whole from the mother and allowing that to happen without killing the mother."

2,I will vote and I will pay attention to the news but I am done putting the news on a pedestal in my life. Not long ago my day shifted based on how bad the news was and every day it was bad so my days were all bad. Eventually I just decided to leave the room when the news is on and only read off of this subreddit. I’m still keeping my eyes open to the possibilities but now I’m slowing down on the politics. Now i sadly watch my dad fall deeper and deeper into this political hole and lose care for everything.
1,"That is an interesting question and I think you are seeing the statements that conservatives typically make regarding individual liberty (i should be able to make my own decisions because I am free to do so, I just have to deal with the consequences of that decision) and relating it to this issue. Is that the case? I'm sorry if it isn't, that's just the connection that I see and would appreciate clarification if I'm incorrect. 
I think the distinction is that we regard the pregnant woman and the unborn baby as individuals with inherent value simply because they are human. That idea has ramifications. We believe both of those individuals have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. So because the baby is a living individual, it has a right to life and should be provided that as much as we are able. Additionally, the destruction of a life, which we would say begins at conception, at the hands of another is murder, which is something we believe is wrong.
I hope this helps. If you have any more questions or would like to discuss things more, feel free to dm me. I know I'm not always the best at clearly articulating my view, so I would be glad to discuss it further."

2,"It is encouraging to hear that my response was helpful. Thank you.
I agree that is important to listen to the opposing side. I find i often become arrogantly certain that I am absolutely correct when I either just think through it on my own or only listen to those that agree with me. But hearing the other side often adds perspective or brings up things that I didn't consider. This doesn't always change my position, but it helps me consider more aspects than I originally did which is important to having opinions about the world as a whole and how different things work together."
2,Murder of a human or murder of a fetus?
0,"I get that ""pro-life"" see life at conception, but why not also support adequate sex education and contraceptives instead of abstinence only to prevent unwanted pregnancies, and welfare to help these kids after they are born so the mother doesn't feel like she needs to abort because she has no future?"
2,Just murder. Or rape. Or any crime that should be punished. What is your basis for punishing crime in general?
1,"Thank you for your questions. As before I think those are important questions to ask especially since they can have a big impact on the lives of people involved. 
Would you expand on what sex education would look like? I think I would agree that sex education is important. I don't always agree with how it is put into practice (for example I live in a state that begins sex education in kindergarten. In my opinion that is far too early to begin discussing that topic). So if you clarify what you would desire in that regard, I could give you my opinion in that area. 
In regards to your point on abstinence verses other options, my personal belief is that sex is something reserved for marriage. In holding that view, I acknowledge that others do not hold that view. So I would hold abstinence as the ideal. That's what I believe people should do, but since they aren't going to, providing instruction in the other areas would be beneficial, but I would still emphasize the ideal. I don't believe contraceptives are wrong, I just don't think they are best before marriage. 
I think another reason abstinence is promoted over the other options is that no matter how effective the other options are, there is still a chance that it doesn't work, while with abstinence, it should be entirely effective because if you don't participate in the act that gets you pregnant, you can't get pregnant. Actions have consequences, if you do not want to be pregnant or to deal with a child, the most effective way to prevent that is to avoid participating in the activity that results in pregnancy. If you participate in that activity, you risk the result. 
I don't know that this specifically answers your questing, but one objection I personally would have to welfare being used as a solution is I don't believe it is the government's job to take care of children whose parents would struggle to provide for them. Instead I would say it is the responsibility of the people in that community to come alongside that mother and assist her in the provision and raising of that child. One of the ways this manifests is through charity like Pregnancy Resource Center and individuals seeing the need of that mother and child. 
If a person is truly holding to the pro-life view, they must continue to value the life of that child after they are born and so must be willing to do what it takes to protect that life. The child doesn't cease to be valuable as a human just because they have left the protection of their mother's womb. 
As before I hope I was helpful. If you have any questions or would like clarification, you are welcome to dm me. Thank you for your time."
2,Murdering a frog never got me in jail though. Your analogy is false.
1,"You can't murder a frog because a frog is not a human being. Unborn children are unquestionably human. 

You're deflecting through equivocation because you have no answer. Answer me or expose yourself as a zealot. Upon what moral basis do we punish ANY crime?"

1,"These kinds of statistics will soon be scrubbed from the internet. I’m already noticing this in many aspects. Not only will they scrub the historical crime data, governments that have succumbed to identity politics will simply stop tabulating data on criminality altogether... Well, they’ll obviously still calculate the criminality of white individuals because we are the biggest threat to western civilization, (obviously). - I still cannot believe that the President, and one of the most powerful department of defense employees said that fucking bullshit. Sorry for the tangent"

I’m a republican, but this is a stupid meaningless chart."

For example I am a relatively progressive person , but I believe that in case that someone is a criminal (like killer ,rapist), bigot, doesn't believe in gender equality  etc then we shouldn't allow them to stay in a country or they should be deported. But if someone is a tolerant and nice person, I would be okay with them."
1,There is a reason why that statistic stops at 2014. Happens to be about that time the “centrist” party The Radical Left got in Office and made it illegal to collect ethnic data on violent and sexual offences.
2,white privilege
1,"Republicans are usually opposed to unchecked and illegal immigration, expecting some level of assimilation or cultural affinity before being allowed to enter the country.

Statistics like these vindicate those positions, since it is often native citizens suffering at the hands of these criminals, and by extension, their government's policy."

2,I Think it shows the impact of Americas Foreign policy in the middle east over the last 20 years on crime stats in Europe.
2,"I think it's, for every 100,000 people who were born in Denmark, 0.7 persons have committed and was convicted of a rape. So for 200k 1.4 was convicted.

For those of Somali origin over 25 have been convicted. This doesn't even include Somalis who were born in Denmark because it's by country of origin"
2,"You're right, probably missing some context, or maybe is the definition of rape that differs"
2,"I wont down vote you yet, I will give you a chance to come up with proof of your claim. Please provide a link to validate that this claim that these stats are faked.  


Also, note that not all, but a lot of times when republicans disagree with stats its because there is a reason to besides they hurt my feelings. Like there are conflicting reports. Like a month or so ago when the CDC said Florida's daily covid death rates where through the roof, but come to find out the CDC had messed up the data and took a 3 day death total and displayed it as happening in 2 days. There were news articles proving this mistake, in that instance, yes republicans disagreed with stats because they were proven wrong.  


On that note I am giving you a chance to prove this wrong.  


But, while these links don't confirm these actual stats they do confirm the sentiment that the refugees from africa and the middle east are causing crime and rape problems in europe.

2,"You are right, in this statistic you need to take into account weather getting that statistic uses a general definition of rape or if it uses it's own countries law or definition of rape which it's actually surprising how laws differ extremely from country to country.

However even if their using the country of origins laws you would still have to wonder why Denmark has a low rape count? Do they have extremely strict laws or are they hiding their cases from us? Does Denmark stack up in comparison to other western countries(where the laws would be somewhat similar, obviously there would be some differences between them all) and would that show us something vastly different in comparison?

Also, if you were to look at the stat through a different lens like ""ohh well Denmark is just more civil"" or something of the sort then suddenly this has a vastly different meaning to what is presented as truth.

In other words, this statistic paints a pretty incomplete picture and it would help if it had something to drive the point home that wasn't itself."
2,"Or they just have less rapes in general. If you only have 2 rapes per 100,000 people, it would end up that you are arresting around 35% of them which is about twice as high as the rate of the US."
2,"Like ostriches sticking their head in the sand. Ignoring the problem doesn't make it go away. They're accomplices if you ask me, they know what will happen and its a price they are willing to pay. It's sick."

2,Well for 12 of the past 20 years the US had republican president's...
2,"True, there were no male witnesses and the woman were showing their faces.

not rape, culturally"
2,"I appreciate the opportunity, but I don’t really know, and I never purported to.  I am however, skeptical, and I always am when I see online tables because statistics can be manipulated!  And to this fact, there is no arguing.  There are entire libraries filled with books about how statistics can be misleading and purposefully deceitful.  

To reiterate and be clear, I simply disagreed with the prevailing sentiment and pointed out that statistics can be misleading. I have not done research into this specific instance, and I don’t care to.

As far as statistics being misleading, I am not going to link a bunch of articles you probably won’t read."
2,Less reported rapes* or else the families honor is shot
2,"Yup, in their culture it's not rape, shouldn't be in the same graph. 

Also, we should most likely start going by their laws in order to be inclusive."
1,"Ok, so to be clear, I gave you an opportunity to defend your statement that this table is false. And you essentially refuse to take it, saying you don't care to research the topic and based on your edit only spoke up in defiance of the information because you want to mirror republican behavior.

But like I said, and proved, above. When we disagree we often have evidence to back it up. We don't disagree because the information provided hurt our feelings.

Also you say stats can be and are manipulated. I 100% agree with you. I have an example.

The other day I saw a news clip that said, ""vaccinated people have a 99.999% survival rate. Unvaccinated people are 25 times more likely to die"" that sounds drastic! 99.999% survival rate vs 25 times more likely to die... Let's do that math.

100 - 99.999 = 0.001 (chance of death while vaccinated)

0.001 x 25 = 0.025 (25 times more likely to die while unvaccinated)

100 - 0.025 = 99.975% chance of survival for unvaccinated people.

Yet people are losing careers over vaccine mandates... For a vaccine that doesn't prevent you from contracting or transmitting. It doesn't even prevent you from dying. For an experimental technology (mRNA) that has never gone past lab trials before this year so there is ZERO long term effect studies.

See when republicans reject things, we typically have logic and facts to justify our stance."
2,"No we shouldn't why should we placate a bunch of murdering, terrorist, rapists?"
0,"I was responding to a comment about statistics being xenophobic. I simply stated that was false and foolish and that statistics can be misleading.



Denmark is the fifth most safe country in the world, and while mainstream news admits there are issues in respect to this area,



The reality is that reporting lags behind. I don’t know the reason for this, but since under reporting is rampant, it makes sense that criminal convictions would follow suit.  Instead of blaming a minority, this article describes a traumatizing process as the major issue.



This article expands on how antiquated the laws are, specifically calling for changes to acquaintance rape, the most common type of rape.  

The statistics are misleading because people are using it push a false narrative which blames refugees coming from a particular locality. It fails to account for the realities of the law and the people living there.  In short, statistics are misleading, and some people in this community are pushing their own narrative instead of actually doing the legwork."

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation….

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.—That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness… it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.****"

The exception is orders that are illegal - soldiers are expected to disobey an illegal order - however, they will have to defend doing so in a court martial (though in wartime they might not make it that far).

The issue here is that this Lt. Colonel was not personally given an illegal order, so he had no grounds to disobey one.  At present, we don't know of any other instance where anyone involved was given an illegal order.  We know lots of **stupid** orders were given, but even so, not to this LTC.

1,"Quite clear you didn’t do military service. 

You complete a mental health exam EVERY year, so don’t buy into he had one because he criticized the president. He completed one because he was required to complete his annual. 

Joe Biden blatantly put marines in danger, despite an abundance of military intelligence without a single doubt telling him exactly what is going to happen months before the Taliban even took Kabul. 

He blatantly disregarded intelligence, armed the Taliban to the teeth so when we inevitably go in next it will be a slaughter, and made one of the worst military decisions possibly any president has made. 

We abandoned our allies, are openly being disrespected across the world, and made this world a lot more dangerous of a place because of his immaturity. 

Or are we going to talk about the blatant disrespect for every dead service member brought home according to a barrage of witnesses’ and gold star families?  

This president is effectively the sole reason for tens of thousands of deaths and ensured many more to come in the future. 

Calling out this administration for the blatant disregard for human life is only right, if he faces jail time so be it, he did the right thing.

The military may not be a “democracy”, but having completely arrogant and disastrous leadership that directly leads to the death of the men you swore to protect under your command, you morally have a right to say something."

Still millions of Americans out of work because our economy is shit. Democrats extended unemployment way too long and paid bonuses to people too lazy to look for a job. Many businesses closed because they couldn't find workers. 
 So you're full of crap if you think a majority support attacking an honest General that told the truth about Afganistan. Even the deep state leaked Bidens phone call with the Afganistan president asking him to lie about the Taliban having power."

0,"He didn't respond because Uniform Code requires him not to speak on political matters which is what he said - I'm not defending him I'm answering a question as to why he is not in violation - when did the GOP become so touchy Feely - he broke the code,  - he's undisciplined - military discipline is crucial to the national defense - end"

That is the punishment for treason

Declare your independence and get to fighting. Otherwise 

If you don't love it, leave it

1,It's not political correctness. It military law to maintain order and discipline.
1,"...and when you violate the UCMJ to do so, there can be consequences (unless you are a leftist)."
2,You get to say all that because your not in the military - he doesn't cause he is - he could have resigned and said anything he wanted - he didn't so he violated military law - it ain't about your feelings - it's about maintaining discipline
2,"Yeah that's why I said none. 

Thought it made more sense to work here to build America than nation build in the Middle East.

Interesting timing on his annual ""Schelle acknowledged that he was the one who was forced to undergo a mental health screening after his initial video."""
2,He's was a Lt Col. and I'm not talking about Biden - I'm talking about military discipline - 93 upvotes
2,"No? Immoral or unethical behavior should always be questioned; since you mention UCMJ, I should tell you we are required to disobey unlawful orders and are supposed to question seemingly unethical actions are report them."
2,Yep.  That's how the military works.
2,He could have resigned his commission as an officer and flapped his gums all day with no worries or repercussions - he didn't and violated the law
2,"So you think the only reason this was added to the declaration of independence is because Jefferson was only justifying their actions? I think it was more so those that came after them would know what should be done and create a legal path todo so. I'm sure no lawyer but it seems to be more than justification but a warning to be prepared for future tyranny.

I definitely agree with the love it or leave it part tho. I think more than a few need to have their citizenship revoked and sent out of the country and some should be held accountable for their actions that have lead to our current situation."
1,"What happened to the military officers like Alexander Vindman who not only criticized Trump, he lied under oath for a phony impeachment? He filed a false whistle-blower complaint claiming he heard the Ukraine phone call. He didn't. An Obama holdover Eric Ciara-mella heard the call and used Alexander Vindman as a phony witness. No charges were  given to Vindman even after he was caught lying."
2,"I am in the military and nothing restricts my speech off of duty hours or out of uniform. 

For commissioned officers it is indeed different. My point is there’s a different between morals and laws. 

He was have been limited by law in technically, but morally he had an obligation to defend the honor and the lives of the service members serving under him. 

Countlessly the president and other high appointed officials, military and not do things that are blatantly against the UCMJ and against the law. Almost never do they face repercussions, and even very little do they receive scrutiny, that is as long as it sides with the left viewpoint that almost every corporation sector  and power house in this country supports."
2,The reality of Military service
1,"Correct.  What immoral or unethical order was Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller given, that he had a duty to disobey?

Contrary to leftist belief, *not liking* the President or senior officers does not grant military personnel carte blanche to disobey their lawful orders or act disrespectfully toward them."
2,So you can tell the difference between President and commanding officer?
1,"There is no legal path to overthrow the government.

There is a constitutional system to create laws, judge them and amend the constitution. You should know that as a ""constitutional conservative"".

You advocate something else it's called sedition or treason against our constitutional republic. They make tall trees and short prices of rope for them folks."
2,Then he should have resigned his commission and then complained - citizen presidents don't get court martials bc their not soldiers - who was the last president some country didn't want tried for war crimes - they don't get a fcking opinion - nor does a commissioned officer - period
2,The UCMJ and code of conduct clearly restricts speech of any enlisted or commissioned officer in the military.  You might need a crash course on military law.
2,"No, abandoning our people and actively arming a terrorists organization is plenty of ammunition to question what the hell is going on.  If you can’t even admit that point, I don’t see a reason in continuing this conversation."
2,"Yeah like the the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of a military department who are also covered and who I assume probably had something to do with the withdrawal - it's getting sad now"
2,Do you personally believe the current president and his administration have become a danger to America?
2,So your saying the declaration of independence is nothing but paper or our constitution?
2,"Go ahead and look up the hatch act and DOD Directive 1344.10. 

The UCMJ directly states commissioned officers."
1,"> No, abandoning our people and actively arming a terrorists organization is plenty of ammunition to question what the hell is going on.

It absolutely is.  However, those don't relate to orders Lt. Colonel Scheller was given.

His first video was a violation of Article 88 of the UCMJ.  His second video was a violation of that, and arguably Article 94 also, because it included the statement  ""Follow me, and we will bring the whole [expletive] system down"".  The possible penalties for violation of Article 88 are dismissal, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for one year.  Article 94 has the potential to carry a death penalty.

Biden and the senior officers under his command did a lot of bad things, and they should all spend time in prison.  ...but what Scheller did was dumb."
2,"The declaration of independence was a document explaining why British citizens were overthrowing their government and included specific examples of abuses by the king to justify why they were doing it to gather support from other British subjects living in the colonies and other European powers.

The Constitution was created to create a new constitutional republic to replace a failing confederacy of states. It includes a blue print for how this government should operate and how it can be changed through constitutional amendments. All states ratified this through a vote making it the new law of the land.

The bill of rights were added later through the amendment process established in the constitution because it was the law of the land. 

There is no, we declared independence so you can legally do it whenever you want clause.

Again, you want a revolution prepare to get bloody. And if that's you intention, quit pussy footing around, declare you rebellion and get to fighting"
2,"Well the only thing evil need to spread is for good men to do nothing. 

I would rather find peaceful legal solution. However I won't choose doing nothing while evil destroys our country and the American way of life. 
My family had fought in every war this nation has ever been in from the 1st to the last. I won't be the one to change that. While it scares the hell out of me, I won't comply with what my heart tells me is wrong."
2,"So when does your declaration of independence get released. 

The colonists had 27 abuses and usurpations by the king to justify their treason. Let's start with the abuses and usurpations you feel the Constitutional Republic has completed against you."

1,It's good to see President Sippy Cup finally getting tough on border control. /s
1,"Biden and Democrats want to believe their lies that everything went okay that they are going to leave Americans to die there. If they helped then it would be acknowledging they messed everything up. 

Democrats strategy appears to be just parrot the propaganda for months and hope people believe your shi$t doesn't stink if you do it long enough."
1,It's possible that all of this was intentional. What if the Americans left behind were Biden's enemies. Biden hands the Taliban their name and addresses and let's the Taliban do his dirty work for him. His enemies are dead. Problem solved. He will take a hit in the polls early on in his administration in the hopes that by 2024 it's all forgotten.
2,"But he said efforts to get people out would be ""ongoing""."
1,Two things Democrats are great at.. supporting death through abortion and abandonment.
1,"The Taliban is holding some outgoing flights for ransom so I would understand if this was a preventative measure, but considering it's the Biden administration, I'm sure that wouldn't be the reasoning."
2,"> Clay received word on Thursday that their flights out of Afghanistan would eventually receive approval following the State Department’s review of their manifest — a task that could take several days even as just the initial 800 names are subjected to the vetting process.

You want 100% of the people in those planes to be vetted, right? If they were all US nationals, this would be different."

1,so true. the USA should take note. ugh nvm we got Joe and the hoe running the circus.
0,"Sorry, but this data is completely made up.  Please check the government sites for Sweden and Israel for factual data.  Also, no country is currently on their 3rd shot of vaccine in other than critical care deployments.   This is just designed to rile people up and try to prove a point that isn’t supported by either measured fact or by critical reasoning.  Vaccines work.  Masks work.  Social distancing works.  The USA proved this was effective under both Trump and Biden.  Now we’re suffering again thanks to people spreading these lies.  Viruses mutate.  That’s why we get a different flu vaccine every year.  Covid mutated in the the more aggressive and dangerous Delta variant.  Now people with no defenses, folks who refuse to get vaccinated, are being hit hard.  This sucks and is completely avoidable.  How do I know this.  I’ve got two doctors in my family, both working ICUs.  Both watching people suffer and die.  Direct observation of fact.  Please get vaccinated and end this.

Edit:  As I noted in a follow up comment below, I was looking at the unvaccinated occurrence of infection, not the overall country rate.  But this also bought up the key difference in vaccination between Sweden and Israel.  Sweden is far more vaccinated than Israel is.  Hence lower  Hence relaxation of mask and social distancing.  Vaccinate and wear masks to help protect the unvaccinated."
2,The county we live in has nearly 100% vax participation and the R-eff has been 0.9 for almost two weeks. Mask mandates still in place...
1,I took a lot of heat on arguing that mask mandates don’t work. They’re quite a hive
0," boosters just started so that’s not relevant. 

Look at Sweden’s vaccination rate. Additionally because mask mandates don’t exist doesn’t mean people aren’t wearing masks and distancing because they are.  Nordics take community efforts seriously and usually don’t need to be mandated to do the right thing."
2,"This is really true data, and it’s not a bad two groups to pit against each other, they are both relatively small countries that are mostly homogenous racially, and the only true difference is claimed it (and I do wonder if that has anything to do with it, the Middle East is… Well, desert, and isn’t Sweden fairly cold?)"
1,Mask killed my mom it has no use they just recommend it to us so we vote dems
2,"I’m not antivaxx, but don’t give over 330 million people a vaccine until your positive it works. That’s just common sense"
2,you realize the population is only bigger by 1 million in swedes yet it’s 21x bigger?
1,I'm happy to be in the control group until human trials are over.
2,not to mention sweden is 21x bigger then israel with a slightly similar population
2,"Seems legit to me.  
[Sweden](

[Israel](  

From swedish government:  
  

  

55 in ICU in entire Sweden atm."
2,"Swede here. I live in Stockholm. Hopefully my tourism in this sub will be tolerated. 
 
Practically no one wears mask, if someone does it is almost always old people and they usually wear the good tightly fitted ones. Slightly more people wear on public transport, some put them on just when they travel. Walking in central stockholm, maybe 1 in 100 you see wear mask. Cashiers and working people are some times required to wear one. Mostly people stopped caring.  

[Here is Stockholm, July '21, 600 people [sound]]("
2,"Sweden is also over 10x larger with a significantly higher income population and a similar population size, most of their mandates that restricted public crowding and enforced social distancing were lifted in mid-July. In terms of vaccination, Sweden is at about 60%, and while climate can affect viral transmission, it is likely in large part to Sweden's much lower population density that we see these numbers"
1,Weren't Sturgis and the Trump rallies the superspreader events that didn't happen?
2,"The alternative to facts and knowledge isn’t OK when it comes to a subject, a very communicable disease in this case, that affects people in a community.  If it only affected an individual then do as you like regardless of observable fact and measurement."
0,"You are correct.  I was looking at unvaccinated case rates, not country wide case rates.  That was my mistake and I apologize for the error.  The statistic that’s missing here is the country wide vaccination rate.  Sweden is far ahead of Israel on that which is what’s driving their low case rate

Message stays the same.  Wear a mask.  Get Vaccinated.  If you’re sick, stay away from others.  This is basic healthcare stuff that we’ve known about for several centuries."
1,"They were supposed to be, but it turns out the bigger the crowd of people that don't give a shit, the less reported cases there are. Anyone that got sick probably hung out at home and thought to themselves, "" well shit I'm sick "" then a few days later felt better just like 99% of everyone else that gets this.   They didn't go on national TV and talk about their positive test and how everyone should get vaccinated, so the news is not interested."

2,"Doctors have a duty to do no harm, if you wanted lots of pain killers that could stop your breathing and kill you, there’s a limit to what they will give since they can’t practice what would be literal suicide at that point. Also there are laws. In the case of a doctor won’t intubate or use resuscitative measures if you have that signed along with other treatment modalities you can chose to refuse. Plus depending on the drug many have drug-drug interactions that could either enhance or decrease the current efficacy of medications you’re on based on its metabolism. Lastly it’s for prevention of law suits. Let’s say you ask for a bunch of random medication and survive yet have side effects that cause permanent damage or require surgery or other things, now you’ll be suing the hospital. 

Lastly in the case of this tweets correlation doesn’t equal causation. Ivermectin is used to treat parasites. People are buying animal formulations and overdosing themselves, and the media is having a field day calling it medicine. Just like I’ve seen people struggling financially use animal antibiotics and getting deathly sick or using insulin doses for pets. Covid is a virus. Viruses aren’t alive. Just like antibiotics which work on bacteria wouldn’t help in this case, neither would anti fungal medication. 

I also don’t understand why the people who adamantly argue that this virus is a hoax or man made or not that serious and won’t get vaccinated or wear a mask suddenly feel so scared of it that they have to take ivermectin.  

Next thing you know, covid patients are gonna be asking for chemo and radiation to kill everything in their body."
2,"Yes, the hypocrite oath. Yes, assisted suicide is for the most part illegal in the US. I am familiar with DNRs, I used to be a paramedic and worked in a trauma center. Also I am familiar with contraindications when I comes to medication, I was a line Medic in the Army. However, if I was in sound mind and sighed a liability waver or give power of attorney to a family member, thus relasing the attending physician of any and all legal liability prior to my contraction of ANY virus or illness, why not?  The virus is not a hoax but, my job allows me to view certain government materials. The last brief I read was that COVID spread was ""very unlikely"" to be spread naturally. ""More than likely"" leak out the lab, however not meant to be a bio agent. 

I do not believe any virus is a hoax, we have pictures of them. That was not my argument."
2,I mean I support the whole your body your choice thing. I’m only a 4th year medical student so I can’t speak from too much experience yet. I think if the person is willing to pay and like you said of sound mind and judgement and doesn’t hold anyone liable then by all means. But they shouldn’t then go and claim whatever worked for them as a miracle cure without further testing since there are many factors that go into play. And a sample size of 1 is meaningless.
2,"Much respect for being a med sudent!! We need more doctors in this country. You are a 4th year med student you can absolutely speak. Do not think you can not. I don't advocate for for treatments that work worked for me will work for others. I am a big dude. So my doses are usually higher. However, if look at dose to weight ratios you can see why people do things, without the understanding of rNA insulin vs. Synthetic."
