1,"The anti-American Democrat judges are dismissing amnesty cases and hundreds of illegals are being released into our country.
They are doing this while everyone is distracted. No one is trying to stop any of this insanity."
1,Pelosi is not someone we admire or listen to.
1,"And I see this plain as day on social media....the conservatives want to keep our freedoms, and stand up for our individual rights!!!!! And once you give away those rights, one by one, little by little...they got you!!!

What I see from the left is all about hate, and division and just plain nasty to those who don't follow along blindly....they
seem to enjoy the comfort of being told what to do!

It's sickening
And sad....."
0,"There's a story, a legend, really, of a Japanese American internee during WWII: One of the most stunning ironies in this episode of American civil liberties was articulated by an internee who, when told that the Japanese were put in those camps for their own protection, countered ""If we were put there for our protection, why were the guns at the guard towers pointed inward, instead of outward?"""
0,"She is a rich elite, bitter old has been, that thinks she is better than everyone"
1,That's what happens when you give up your guns.
2,"All control, to everyone who follow the crap these people tell you are weak and spineless! You are all being screwed and quit following the people who call themselves the professionals. This is just sick and Americans need to rise up, we carve our own path not them."
1,"If you're dumb enough to still support the Democrat party in 2021, there is probably no help for you."
1,The second amendment has never been so important...
1,"Living in Melbourne, Australia has become mentally crushing. Yesterday we had only 50 people testing positive to Covid. But we only have 25 people in hospital and 5 in ICU & no deaths at all this year - that is state wide total - not per day. But the entire state of over 5 million is in lockdown, curfew 9pm-5am, can only travel 5km from home, allowed outside for only 1 hour per day to excercise, all businesses except for essential services are closed-most are now backrupt, schools are still closed. This is our 6th lockdown - we have had more than 200 days in lockdown and no school attendance for 200 days. The mental health in the school aged children is our new pandemic but Victorian government will not address it - or even discuss it at their daily press conference. Violent protests are not the answer - but we are not surprised that it is sadly coming to this.üò¢"
2,Had enough? Going to get worse if you don't vote them out! See Australia!
1,Whether you're vaccinated or not please boycott any business that participates in these passports or mandates. Our Freedom is at stake and money still talks!
2,"She's counting on the same ""sophistication
"" parameters that was at Obama's party. You know those elite folks don't need the same directives like the little people."
2,"We've been watching this hypocrisy for well over a year. Americans controlled by fear, who would have thought."
2,"We have been failed by our so called representatives
and they all need to be thrown out of office.
They have ignored the southern border botched Afghanistan screwed up the covid response and so many other things üòûüá∫üá∏üçÄ"
1,"Not a lot of diversity among those rich Democrats either. I thought they loved diversity? Why so white?! Could it be‚Ä¶they‚Äôre the racist ones after? Yes? Thought so. I wish Nancy would put her mask on and breathe in really deep, multiple times."
2,"One of the few things that I am really getting very annoyed with is the claim that it is only/
those who voted for Trump, who are not getting vaccinated. I do not believe that is true., there probably are some. As there are also probably some voters who haven't been vaccinated either."
2,"Anyone listening to politicians for any medical advice deserves whatever happens to them. And by politicians, I include so called public health officials. They are politicians."
2,So sad to see what is happening to this country‚Ä¶ right before our eyes.
1,"They're lying about everything. Everything. Obama's maskless bday party, Pelosi maskless, Biden's open borders letting covid positive people in. They're flat out lying. Actions speak louder than words."
1,The world is coming to an end! People are losing their minds over a virus and other ridiculous things! Good grief‚Ä¶people have so much fear‚Ä¶I can hardly believe this stuff!!
1,"I haven‚Äôt worn a mask from the very beginning. I will not comply to medical staff or to this administrations
attempt to control the American people! Citizens need to stand your ground!"
2,How great has Australia become? The citizens there are unarmed and helpless to resist these tyrants. Covid will never be as dangerous as the scourge that is liberalism and globalism.
0,"Im no longer a proud Aussie.Its disgusting what the governments are doing here, especially increasing police powers. We are fed up here."
1,frightening thing is there are quite a few people in this country who not only accept being micro managed with authoritarian restrictions and mandates but actually demand it
1,Covidiots at their finest. Sadly I know many who do and would think this is completely fine and normal. They are lost and will reap what they sow.
2,Before she sets foot on House floor she must undertake COVID test and show her passport for negative test results before she travels back to DC.
2,"Tucker, you are the closest person I know to any ""elite"". Please pass this on. I do no care what that women thinks, feels, says or smells like. She is NOTHING to me or MY Country."
1,The real American enemy isn‚Äôt hiding anymore. Socialism and communism is open and in the move
1,"Pelosi, Domestic Enemy of the United States of America n the American People, TREASON n Crimes against Humanity!IMPEAC
H HER NOW!!!!!!!"
1,"This is insanity. Welcome to communism. So sad and scary, but this is truly where we are headed."
1,How much longer does this have to go on? Trump won. We need our audits done across the Country and we need our President back.
2,I believe a good reason the lockdowns have not been as bad in the US is because the average american owns guns.
2,"You don‚Äôt need a mask at Obama‚Äôs birthday party either, Covid doesn‚Äôt spread at Democratic functions"
2,"The ""law "" is only for poor and uneducated people. I remember they said that for Obama's Birthday party."
1,People need to start buying guns and protect their families because the government is up to something bad
1,"All about control and one world government. Being locked in your home with no interaction with others is not a life. We either take a stand and refuse to be bullied and isolated, or they will continue to take away our freedom."
2,"This whole segment is very interesting, thought provoking and scary at the same time. I can‚Äôt believe the direction the world is heading, so sad."
0,This is a group of very sophisticated people isn't that what was said about Obama's party? I'm sure covid knows this.
1,Where are all the liberals defending this??? This whole mask issue is just to see who will comply for what's really coming are way. Wake up!! Rules for thee not for me!!
1,"What's funny to me is that the people that are on board with the masks, shot, and stay at home orders REALLY believe that it will end. That it's only temporary. They never notice the gov never speaks of an end. Just more and more restrictions. It's horrifying to think people are this blind."
1,Radical left will try to get every one of our rights eliminated.
1,"After so long of being told to stay home, don‚Äôt talk or interact with anyone and mandatory lockdowns the people will get tired of it! The people will raise up against their ‚Äúleaders‚Äù and we will see countries succumb to revolutions much like the French Revolution! The people will get tired of being controlled, lied to and fed lines that the governing bodies knows what‚Äôs best for you while they‚Äôre actively breaking their own mandates and requirements to semi participate in society."
1,I have a sense of humor. I won't take a joke (Nancy Pelosi) seriously.
1,Maybe now Australians will regret giving away there firearms rights
1,"Pelosi was tricked into giving this speech for $30,000 for each ticket. Just like she got tricked into getting a haircut when she had the salon owner open up her non-essential business."
2,Not all of us are too far gone Tucker. We cannot laugh because once vibrant cities have been destroyed and hardworking Australians have lost all.
0,"The Nobles Elites billionaires all they want is there way. They want to treat humans like slaves, control and you wonder why the Taliban Insurgency got the best of our USA. That why our forefathers wrote the Constitution so as the wealthy Elite could not run over us humans. ""Peace Shalom"""
2,No. She thinks she is above the law. So sad. The world is heading in The wrong direction. Praying we all somehow get thru this.
2,The fact that anyone can ignore this hypocrisy and corruption is unreal. These are insane times.
1,"Highly predictable 0utcomes from and by Governments that want to and have confiscated their guns, loss of free expression and the right to peacefully protest against the government is taken away, and Tyranical Woke Leftist Powers and impositions by the Government follow quickly, who could believe what is and has happened in Australia and New Zealand"
1,"Just another evening in the world of the hypocritical ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù
extreme left, who are all mysteriously immune to COVID 19 and free from government suppression, unlike their masked servants."
2,"Typically you will see the Government gain control by fear or free stuff.
The message: for Thee but not for me.
Hopefully more Americans will wake up and see what‚Äôs going on here."
1,"I live in Melbourne and would move to Florida if the Australian Government would open the borders and let us leave.

It is 1960""s Russia here."
1,People must have been smarter back then because Democrats have been applying the mask mandates for us peasants for over a year but not following the same mandates themselves and we keep allowing it to happen.
2,"I live in Melbourne, Australia Tucker, I'm in my 50s now & am so disturbed about what is happening here üò≥ Thank you for reporting the truth & sharing the plight of my country üôè I'm scared to leave my home here & barely go out, this is not the country I grew up in & loved, this is hell on earth üò¢"
1,Highest hypocrisy from dems. A little bit of science and anyone can get that mask doesn‚Äôt protect but destroys your lungs and immune system.
2,Complete control of we the people using scare tactics until we expose them for what they really are. Domestic Terrorist groups and this Tyranny group are all about totally controlling we the people and destroying our Great Society any way they can so they can stay in power
2,"Here in Washington state the governor's mandate on the vaccine, excludes himself, all cabinet members, all state commissioners, and all state board members, but their employees MUST get the vaccine. Makes you go hmmm."
2,"Worst thing about it: I saw footage of protest here on facebook from some Australian outlet. And 99% of comments was: ""so many stupid and selfish people, they deserve what they got, they treated them too lightly.""
I found only 3 comments supporting the protesters.
I must say I was shocked especially by how many people used the term ""selfish"" parroting the mass media. Brainwashed."
2,"Disgusting. How can anyone continue to elect such garbage? Off topic, and this isn't a left or right thing, because there are plenty on the right too, but holding a government position for this long, gaining the wealth and power she has from it, shouldn't be allowed. For Pete's sake... üò°"
1,We are the deplorable servants. She is the elitist who wants to put a crown on her head so we can bow down and kiss her behind. Over my dead body.
0,"Australia has apparently come full circle.
Prison colony to prison country"
1,"From Australia, here is the link to the 12 year old girl being handcuffed, man -handled, and arrested for the high crime of not wearing a face mask ..... judge for yourselves ....//

2,"I can't believe police in Australia have sunk to an all time low and are arresting citizens for basically nothing.....Ver
y sad .....our world is becoming ""1984)"
2,Cant make this crap up.....Im so disgusted with our current hypocrits in office. Wake up America and take our country back
2,It‚Äôs absolute frightening lunacy! Thank you for showing this. We as Americans need to see where this is heading.
1,"When is Pelosi being impeached? Oh that's right, she's a Democrat. They are protected by hypocrisy."
2,I was just talking about this. I don't watch Fox News anymore but this is exactly what I have been trying to say. Look at the tyrannical policies being enforced. It's coming to the US if people don't wake up. Read the studies and look at the science. Don't just take the word of mainstream media. They are trying to push a narrative that is absolutely not supported by the science. This is absolutely sickening.
1,"Yes it is every bit as bad in Melbourne Australia as it appears!
200 plus days of hard lockdown plus a similar amount under heavy restrictions such as not being allowed to have any visitors, work, travel more than 5kms,( 3 miles), and curfew from 9pm to 5am.
We are under the control of an insane dictator obsessed with eradication of the virus while nuking everything!
Kids and people are topping themselves or attempting to, and going around the bend.
Fine for going to the protest or disobeying rules is $5000 dollars!!
The mainstream media are pushing the same propaganda as the Andrews government has inflicted on us.
Lockdowns mightn't even end after we hit 80% vaccinated, now they're pushing for kids to be included!
I Weep for my children's future, democracy Worldwide has never been more in peril! üòï"
1,"Australia is a perfect example of why Americans should be so grateful of the 2nd amendment and do everything you can to protect it!
I don‚Äôt believe Australia‚Äôs government would be doing what they‚Äôre doing if they had a nation full of arm citizens."
2,"Let's not forget that the government has confiscated all the civilian guns as well. Oh that's right, they were forcefully surrendered."
1,"I am from a Suburb in Sydney, NSW. Every morning at 11am all the MSM televise our Premier, Gladys Berajiglian ranting and raving about this Delta virus and the dangers of it. We went into lockdown on 26 June 2021 and as of Monday 23rd August, she placed a curfew, no one allowed out of their home between 9pm -5am. when this Delta outbreak began, she said 1,000sands are going to get the virus and 1,000sands are going to die. So far 130 have passed away, and I would be confident to say 100 died of old age and the rest died of other illnesses other than Delta. They even listed a 15yr old boy as a Covid death who was in Hospital for menningacoccal.
It is absolute Tyranny in the state of NSW. We are not even allowed to protest, the Government has given the Police force all powers to make sure of that.

They have scared the population so much that 6,000,000 have had at least 1 dose of the vaccine.

We are living in a nightmare in ""The Lucky Country."
2,"She is the poster child for ‚ÄúTerm Limits ‚Äú‚Ä¶.$30,000 a plate to hear this windbag blow‚Ä¶Money could have been well spent on other things within her community she serves‚Ä¶Complete
and utter disgrace‚Ä¶."
1,"I'm in Melbourne I haven't heard any reports about the dog shooting ,we're not under marshal law, the ADF is assisting the police in NSW with checking on people who should be isolating as far as know. We are under a curfew 9pm to 5am,and we need permits to work, and that's if your an essential worker, our lockdown rules are pretty harsh, I can't visit my daughters, can only travel over 5kms for work, not pleasure. No standard retail is open, only essential shopping centres, and Saturdays protest came out of pure frustration, people are tired of being locked away, it's a shame it came to that, but people are on edge. If we do get to 80% vaccination, Queensland and Western Australia have said they may not open their boarders to other states ,because they won't 0 covid, so yep we're doing it hard down under. üá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫"
1,Australia is a perfect example of what happens to an UNARMED population....
2,All Americans should of made a stand to stop the control long before the Afghanistan mess.
1,No one can trust their government and do not give up Any constitutional rights or rights to protect yourself
2,Coming to America soon if men and women don‚Äôt realize today that this country‚Äôs freedoms we still have is worth fighting for.
1,When komunist and fascism gets together everyone will be afraid of flu üò¢. Sad to let the history repeat more worst
1,Thanks Tucker Carlson Tonight It's true here in Melbourne. Lockup 6.0 Only allowed out for 5 reasons. Get caught too far from home they fine ya. Curfew. 5km limit. Permits for everything. Kids still learning online. Mental health issues growing. Vacant shops growing. Yet people keep voting the socialists back in.
1,"All this is Happening because they gave up their Guns..If they were a Armed Society this wouldn't be Happening..Ever
y Gun Manufacturer in the US is Expanding its operations to keep up with the Demand for Guns in the us..People know what's going on an they're getting Ready for It.."
2,"These people are brainwashed and the people that have been elected should be charged with treason that's my background and knowing what people should be charged with. It's disgusting to see that they're tearing families apart friends apart jobs apart this is horrible people need to wake up
."
1,"They first took their guns see what can happen ""O"" it can not happen in the USA"
2,"No. My body, my choice. They do not have the right or power to control medical decisions on anyone else's behalf. Mask mandates are illegal. Vaccine mandates are illegal. Any mandate made by the branch is illegal. Only the legislature can write laws, and still are limited by the United States constitution as well as each individual state's constitutions. That is it's purpose...to limit their control. We the people are the boss, not our representatives
. They were elected to represent us, not rule us."
2,"The fact that people aren‚Äôt fed up with all the blatant hypocrisy going on in our government, media or you name it is appalling!! Wake Up!!"
0,"Question...is it the owner that is requiring the employees wear a mask or is it Pelosi? I dont think it's Pelosi. I think it's the caterer and the employees may be going in and out of a building.

We don't have all the facts.

Plus they are outside...masks
are not required outside."
1,"I live in Melbourne, Australia üá¶üá∫ and I can tell you this stuff is happening. It's scary now the government wants kids five years old and up to wear a mask"
2,This is where police have to draw the line and refuse to do the bidding of the government. To participate is reprehensible.
2,"Love your stuff, Tucker. One thing, the Aussie they are hunting was COVID positive and avoiding isolation (currently 14 days of quarantine). He wasn't just avoiding the lockdown, he was knowingly infecting those around him."
0,You skipped the part where Matt Lawson was shot with rubber bullets! The man being dragged into the blockade was shot i think 8 times on his body while 2 other coppers sprayed him with pepper spray. Gutless wonders is what it's called here!
1,"Tucker‚Ä¶.you need to be an investigative reporter that you are and solidify who is actually running this country and trying to change it forever‚Ä¶.you have hinted to it in the past, but we the people want to know who the hell it is. Thank you for what you do everyday"
2,How are Australians not attempting to overthrow their government right now.
2,"Say this out loud and let it sink in...""ELECTIONS
HAVE CONSEQUENCES"". The people that are being elected at every level of government from your local school board to the President don't have your best interests in mind. They run for positions for power and to execute their will not your will or the will of the majority. Take every election as a serious measure to ensure you only your well being but maintain your freedom. Or else this will become Australia..."
1,This was seriously a scary segment. The hypocrisy from Nancy Pelosi is nothing new. She‚Äôs a disgrace. But the drama going on in Australia is unbelievable. I‚Äôm sure none of them are reporting any deaths from cancer or the flu or heart attacks. Over a year later‚Ä¶. And the WORLD still has zero clue.
2,We need to take back our government they are doing nothing for us.
0,"Martial law is coming to us soon, just watch! Our administration wants 2 classes of people, the very rich and the very poor who work to support the rich. Does this sound familiar? We‚Äôve seen it before, just not here‚Ä¶yet."
1,"Our KY state Governor has done same , caught in photos without mask in public events, after mandating masks.üò°"
1,"Why don't you wear a mask Pelosi and I'll do want I want, FREEDOM!"
2,This absolutely terrifying to me. Americans better wake the hell up & start fighting back!
1,Australia gave in when they gave up their guns they gave up their second amendment and they gave up everything that it took for their first amendment their third and everyone else after that Australia caved and they allowed it to happen plain and simple
1,"And they are coming to New Jersey too because our governor is a feckless progressive who has no respect for his constituents.
He prefers criminals illegals and people who like to give away taxpayers money like water."
1,"This is the end result of gun confiscation, what was shown going on in Australia is what happens to a docile unarmed populace. The only reason the powers that be here in the US cannot do what the Aussie's are doing is because of our 2nd Amendment and 500+ million weapons in civilian hands. Once push came to shove as seen with the authoritarianis
m in Australia, American's would fight back but we would not comply with this kind of brutality on our streets from the government. Of course this is just my opinion on what i just saw."
1,Wow! Mr Carlson it must be really frustrating and devastating for you to to provide these news to us. May the Angels of God be with you and your family. God bless you for your heroic love. A God help us deal with tge New world we are facing.
1,I bet they wish they wouldn't have gave up their firearms now. America would be just like this if we didn't have a 2nd Amendment
1,There is evidence that it also spreads via shedding or fecal matter‚Ä¶ so when they finally accept that bit of scientific data maybe they will realize that all the lockdowns and isolating people in groups trapped in their own domiciles was not the smartest idea. The people in charge are going about this all wrong.
2,"Stop calling our elected representatives
leaders!! They work for us and should be representing us‚Ä¶ not leading anything.. rather serving!!"
2,Apparently ppl back then had more integrity than ppl today!
0,I would suggest that Tucker Carlson and others concentrate on fixing what's wrong it their own back yard before they start knocking other places. As usual the story is dramatised out of proportion.
2,Actions always speak louder than words! She is as fake as they come!!
1,Intolerable laws sparked the 1775 revolutionary war of independence against the British Crown. Here we go again waiting for another war of independence against the Democrstic wealthy elite.
0,It will be alot of blood in the streets if that happens in this country to many people with guns and military training the don't agree with this behavior from the government. Just my opinion
2,"Tucker Carlson how dare you call the New Zealand President ""The lady with the teeth who is very popular""
Tucker Carlson, how dare you imply the Govenor of the State of Victoria is a lunatic for saying ""We are breaking the rules if we watch the sunset"" !
PS. I agree with you."
2,Unfortunately there are a number of people who can have all the evidence continually shoved in their faces and it will not make a bit of difference.
2,The hypocrisy within our government is beyond redemption. These oligarchs need to be removed before Americans will ever trust the government again. Does anyone know what the % is on Americans who don't trust the government is? It has to be higher than ever.
1,"It's so very sad for the real people of the United States of America, to have to continue to put up with the Biden administration what a load of rubbish the Biden administration has TURNED out to be. There's no way the real people of the United States of America are being held accountable for the Biden administration.
God bless you all."
1,"Australia is a perfect example when the people become complacent and allow their government to disarm them and rule over them.

Quite frankly I thought Australians were smarter than this. I can see Brits allowing it but I never thought the Aussies would."
2,They are ‚Äúsophisticated people‚Äù like the ones at Obama‚Äôs b-day party. No masks needed.
1,"Fact of the matter....peopl
e don't wear masks when they eat. Having this type of event in NAP with a high rate of COVID is typically Democratic poor optics and she doesn't care. She is the most powerful person in DC...more powerful than the President, and is in Napa to raise money for the Dems and preserve that woeful Gavin Newsome's governorship. Politics, power, and money are far more important to her...witness what she has or has not done for the people of CA in her time in Congress....and
the Dems continue to elect her......pitifu
l.....I left CA in 2013 for TN and while I love the state and all it offers, the politics, economics, social justice, and environmentalis
ts have ridden the Dem and state train into the ground...."
2,"Facebook keeps removing my ""Like"" and ""Angry"" status on this post. I wonder why? Is it going against their community standards?"
0,"Some of your facts are wrong, example only half of Australia is in Lockdown . Sydney NSW , and Melbourne VIC , the rest of the states ( 4 ) are open fully with no restrictions. The other facts are correct, but not explained fully. The man who sneezed in the lift has covid but will not isolate , he wasnts to spread covid to others that's why the Police are looking for him.
Religious services are banned because of lockdown rules , you can only zoom your services. This minister broke the rules knowingly and got caught. Yes the lockdown is over the top , only because of the low vaccine rate in the beginning, now the rates have increased dramatically . Enjoy your show from down under , Sydney, Australia .üëç"
1,"That‚Äôs the state of Victoria which is run by a communist, Daniel Andrews. The protesters should rally around recalling Andrews and running for political office to change these communist rules he‚Äôs put in place."
1,Her little drama queen aoc needs to be the first to wear a mask as well as Schumer and herself
2,Tucker Carlson Tonight I am Australian and the horse lady made me laugh for a bit then you got to the very real segments about Australia and I cried at how accurately wrong we are being treated it‚Äôs an absolute disgrace and so disheartening. Many here are just getting on with their lives whilst our fellow Australians just across the Queensland border into New South Wales are being treated like leapers. I am afraid for our children‚Äôs futures üò¢
2,Don‚Äôt worry about the police beating you with batons... they just want you to stay healthy. üôÑ
2,I'm surprised you did not mention the forced vü™ìination of children. They physically ripped children from their parents' arms and vü™ìinated them.
2,"If you haven‚Äôt watch the movie ‚ÄúThe Hunger Games‚Äù, go ahead and watch all! If you ever notice movies are years in advanced of what could and might happen to our world/ country! The thing is no one wants to believe it! Quit giving up your control! Vote these people out b4 it‚Äôs to late!"
2,How many times did she say young people in less than a minute. The young people are the vulnerable. Raise your kids right.
2,Oh god. This is too sad. As a New Zealander with friends and family in Australia hearing what a compliant community we are makes me realize just how we would have behaved in Nazi Germany.
2,We should have done this last summer when all the rioting and looting was going on. Our us police in every state should have been allowed to use the same kind of force.
2,It's coming to all nations. This is leading to the return of Jesus for the Church. The anti christ will be revealed. Ppl have seen nothing yet.
2,We are with you Australia stand up and fight for your right.
1,"Im an Aussie living in South Australia, we haven't had a new case of C19 for weeks and have had 4 deaths since the start of the plague, but we are still forced to wear face diapers in public."
2,"Anyone who thinks and feels your beneath them is worst than racism, especially when it's coming from your own goverment"
2,"Believe me, I can‚Äôt stand Pelosi, but in fairness this was outdoors, and I am way against giving the maskholes any more ammo."
1,They need to come after Nancy and Obama..... They just held Super spreader events.... LOL.
1,"The thugs in police uniforms started the violence, and sharpshooters wielding military spec automatic rifles were shooting pepper bombs at people, one hitting a 10 year old boy. Others shot rubber bullets, and at least 2 mounted among them ran their terrified horses directly at the people.

No Tucker, this is NOT the Australia you know, and whose Army Engineers‚Äô uniform I once wore with pride.

It‚Äôs now home to the socialist thugs running roughshod over the people. You‚Äôre right about one thing; Victorian, Queensland and Western Australian voters have recently voted them back in.

It‚Äôs unbelievable and, IF I could afford it, and IF I could leave (yes, locked in, locked up and locked down), I‚Äôd emigrate."
2,This kind of crap has been out there since the beginning the problem is people will not listen people will not take charge of thier own choices own life
1,"Maria Papademetri
You must listen to this. They shot dogs in Australia so people wouldn‚Äôt leave their homes to adopt. Much of what he is saying also took place when Stalin was in power. My mother told me of not being allowed to talk to anyone as they‚Äôre being told in Australia now."
1,"What about the next mandate? Do you really believe, after seeing this and Obamas birthday party, that these people are getting the vaccine? Or is it all for show so the masses are mandated? Vaccine is not mandated for the White House or Phizer employees."
2,"Power mad it‚Äôs dangerous, no caring or compassion for anyone . Very sick leaders"
2,"To be fair, it's NOT the federal government of Australia implementing these draconian lockdowns, it's the individual state leaders, over the last 19 months it's shown the the feds only collect taxes and defend the shores"
2,Democrats can do anything they Want to. It's EVERYONE else thay can't. Just remember if you're getting aeay with something there's always someone else going to get you!
1,People are ignoring reports like this and letting their fellow citizens be targeted and made to be criminals. Covid mandates and lockdowns are creating a reward system. Comply and we give you back your freedoms. Till they stop doing that too.
1,"Im in Queensland, Australia.
Certain States have different rules, Victoria is the most totalitarian, New south wales is a bit better, but stil mandating masks and forced vaccinations, but the other 4 states and 2 territories aren't in lock down.
There may be a 3 day lock down here and there if there are 30 ish cases, but it depends on how much of a Dictator the state health officer is"
2,Well we must love hypocrisy today. Because a lot of it is taking place right now and it seems like no one cares
2,The media here plays scenes of people at these rallies calling them selfish with the evil foreboding music in the background and then switch to hopeful uplifting music when showing people in line to get vaccinated calling them heroes.
2,"More Mandates are coming. If they can legally fire someone for not wanting to take the vaccine. Once they declare Global warming a crisis. Your travel will be greatly restricted.
Anyone in politics... regardless the political party they belong too. Should immediately be voted out of office. Sad to say... but for the most part. All of us on here are a systemic part of the problem. We get riled up but quickly calm down. Myself included."
2,We need to stand together & stand up for our rights!!
1,Who‚Äôs going to print the T-shirt‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a dangerous slacker cause a won‚Äôt wear a mask so shoot me‚Äù cause I will wear one. Totally not tasteful but the whole thing is beyond absurd and most Americans are beyond fed up and that also speaking up in defense also of this heinous crime too. The world has gone insane and it‚Äôs time to stand up!
1,"The only reason why I wear a mask, is because I can't afford the $200 ticket the police will give me here in Israel. It's horrible."
1,Shocking but so happy Tucker is speaking out!!! I hope ALL Americans watch this!!!
1,"I have great respect Tucker, and by no means agree with mask mandate. But they are at a table, outside, fixing to eat. Now how do you eat a 30k meal with a mask on. Even Republicans take them off to eat.
This is getting attention for silly reasons."
1,I can‚Äôt with all this. We are going to start killing dogs now because of covid. Society is sick.
1,It's time we stand strong against this bs! They cannot jail all of us o r get money from the poor? They cannot keep up with rules? Rules are made to be bent and laws are made to be broken as far as this ridiculous mandate goes
1,This is not some communist country -- this is AUSTRALIA! We canNOT let this happen here!
1,Who is giving these leaders these rules. They are obviously getting there rules from some higher authority and it definitely not the WHO it‚Äôs something else. This is a takeover of the world and people need to put politics aside and stand up against this tyranny!!!!
2,"""....the people making and enforcing the rules had no intention of following the rules"".........
YEP, that about sums it up right there"
1,Just like Obama's party they all know this is nonsense. They aren't saying so but they're demonstrating it very clearly all of them. They only put on masks for the TV camera.
2,Our mask mandates go into effect Thursday. Mask exceptions on the list: courts in session and meetings or sessions of the Nebraska Legislature üëÄ
2,"Not all Aussies are taking this lying down. Hence why there were thousands in Melbourne, lots in Queensland (who the police could only standby and watch because they were not in lockdown), and in Sydney. You‚Äôre affiliate in Australia (Skynews) is all over it and has a growing following. As you said, people will tolerate a little inconvenience but not hypocrisy."
1,"I can‚Äôt believe what I‚Äôm looking at. How can people accept being treated like prisoners being herded by thugs in uniform‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ all because of a bloody mask.
It is really sinister watching this. And listening to that New Zealand nut warning people not to talk to their neighbors. This has to stop while we can still stop it."
1,"Tucker Carlson Tonight, you‚Äôre not completely correct in your Australian report. Not all of Australia is under Marshall law, just New South Wales and I think Victoria. Queensland is at this point still reasonably free, but it won‚Äôt take much for us to go under either. Interstate travel is near impossible though."
1,The Delta variant is completely undetectable. There is no PCR test or rapid test that can pick up on the Delta variant. The only thing they can believe is that fear is going to drive people to believe that this is a powerful virus. The Delta variant is a weak mutation
2,"What doesn‚Äôt amaze me is that you have a very big crowd that can easily overpower the officers arresting just one individual, but instead of helping they would rather record and just feel like they are doing something ‚Äúimportant‚Äù. That‚Ä¶ is selfish and ignorant‚Ä¶ no, sorry, that‚Äôs selfish and stupid. My opinion of course."
0,"tucker - you stated tonight that gov. abbott refused to,send national guard t the border - not true. they are there now assisting border patrol in arrests. there have been other guard there as well from other states."
2,"Yikes, they had crazy Karen's back in those times too, but with loaded guns üò≥üò¨ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è....well this type of same hyprocrisy of rules for thee, but not for we happened at the G7 too, and there were videos of it documented so why are we all wearing masks again? üôÑ"
2,The world has gone mad!!!! So many people just don't see it. Governments certainly have hidden agendas!
2,"As much as I appreciate the service that our law enforcement provides to our communities, I also know that at any given moment they can turn their backs on me. Not only did we see this happening in several blue states, but now we are seeing it in Canada, New Zealand and now in Australia. If people continue giving these authoritarian politicians more power, and later realized their mistake, by then it will be too late."
2,Wow what BS from Australia. They do not want people talking to each other to expose the lies that are being perpetrated on people.
2,"We've seen what the ""elite""/
will be-- doing!! I pray it shakes us to the core and simply refuse to do ANY unconstitutional act. Those who blame our ""protectors"" that are daily putting their lives on the line for you, shame on you!! Who are answering YOUR calls for help?? The tooth fairy??"
2,"It's coming people, happening in Australia. When is enough is enough. It's time ""WE THE PEOPLE"" take our country back."
1,We would turn Afghanistan in to the greatest country on earth if they sent all the Maga wearing non vaccinated there.
2,She was caught at hair salon ask about it and said some excuse and that she would not talk about it Any further no one pressured her let it go thus will also go away - it‚Äôs their way but they tell u what to do but do as they please and we wonder why the country is divided.
2,"Gr8. Fearless Pelosi can saddle up wth Biden, Harris & the squad & go rescue people out of Afghanistan."
1,"That's what happens when Citizens give up their arms, they become subjects and serfs."
2,"I have a theory that those people freak out so much about that crap because they've lived such shityy lives like stealing from their constituents, their nations and all around being degenerates that they are almost certain they are going to hell so they are doing literally anything to stay alive. Also take notice that their police and I'm sure ours in America will have absolutely zero issue with just following their orders."
2,It's so sad to see that Australians are now facing pure totalitarian fascism! I lived in Australia - Adelaide - in 2000-2001 and I enjoyed the relaxed freedom of Australians then. This is politics turned amok!
0,Tucker Carlson will you be leaving Fox now that they are requiring vaccines for all staff? It seems the hypocrisy is t just in Washington if you stay.
2,"Feudalism is the society they want to bring back.
""he dominant social system in medieval Europe, in which the nobility held lands from the Crown in exchange for military service, and vassals were in turn tenants of the nobles, while the peasants (villeins or serfs) were obliged to live on their lord's land and give him homage, labor, and a share of the produce, notionally in exchange for military protection."""
0,Friggin hypocrites. This is unacceptable. Why isn't something being done about it. Gutless Republicans need to show this video in Congress.
1,Hey Tucker I love your work man and your courage . Am in NZ and yes our esteemed leader it seems was trained by the best tyrants .
2,WHEN SOME PEOPLE HAD COMMON SENSE AND THE NEWS MEDIA SOMETIMES PRESENTED THE TRUTH! So sad those times are completely gone.
2,To bust the system every protester needed to turn themselves in to law enforcement go to jail and bust the bank account making them feed them it's all about the money
2,When will people WAKE UP and realize the sheer HYPOCRISY of this madness?
1,"This is the Democratic Party. Dangerous and hypocritical. Preaching we must all wear face diapers, while they go unmasked. People are hopefully waking up to the insanity!"
1,Good for thee but not for me. They are only mandating masks to turn us against each other. This happened to me yesterday at the Vet office where I was viscously verbally attacked by a woman and told to put on a mask. I was unprepared for this attack as everyplace is really left to your own discretion in our city right now. The only thing I could muster was I don‚Äôt do masks. She sat on the other side of the room videoing me and the whole waiting room and will probably put it on social-media. -I really don't care. Picking on a 100 pound grandma wearing a huge back brace from my recent surgery is how you‚Äôll recognize me. I work on my health everyday of my life as I have autoimmune and back issues. I have felt great for the past 8 years and even more since this recent surgery. She needs to take a look in the mirror at what appeared to me to be a very overweight unhealthy individual and worry about herself. PS I still have the antibodies from Covid that I got while in the Holocaust museum filled with Chinese students here on their winter break before any of us had even heard of it. I was very ill for 10 days. PS- I LIVED!
1,"Tucker, our leader (the lady with the teethü§£)
Just so happens she was the elected President of 'The International Union of Socialist Youth'
You can see her political beliefs have not changed.
We are locked down with under 30 deaths to covid total. ü§¶"
2,Sounds like Australia needs to be liberated... send in the troops muhahaha
1,Australians let them take their guns a long time ago. Now they have no way to resist.
2,To bad the police are against their own fellow citizens. It‚Äôs hard to believe that the world is willing to give it all up so easily. I‚Äôm sure that soon the sleeping giant will wake up and heads will be hurt.
2,"Man, what the heck is happening to common sense and people standing up! So sad and disturbing!"
2,Politicians are and have always been more sophisticated than the rest of us tax paying types..
2,I like and Tustin to a lot of what you say. However. How about looking at the death rates and exposure rates. A fair bit better than USA and Great Britain. I think there‚Äôs something to learn there personally
1,"Covid-19 spike I'm Fl. Hmmm, could it be nc hundred s of illegal s were transport we there and was told the vaccine is OPTIONAL?!"
0,Good thing Australia already disarmed all there citizens.. lolz
0,"Just scary times. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª. Vaccinated and unvaccinated can still spread covid.
Forced vaccinations will hurt some. Medical exemptions have always been there for a reason. Common sense. Your doctor should help you decide this with informed consent. Some people think they are more important then others. No one deserves to die from covid. Access to antibody treatment should be available to everyone. It is humanity. No one is more important then another. I‚Äôm sad seeing this happen. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüíî. If anaphylaxis with first covid shot or obtain GBs or causes a stroke from blood clots. The injured then aren‚Äôt allowed in public places????? Because couldn‚Äôt get their card. Instantly. The weak physically are told it‚Äôs best for them to protect them. Scary. You stay home. Why I go out because I‚Äôm stronger physically then you. While they still spread the disease. It‚Äôs heartbreaking. üíî
If your vaccinated with a ‚Äúcold‚Äù. It can still be covid and you can still spread it.
Need to enforce SICk POLICIES regardless of vaccination status. Not just punish vulnerable populations.
Next we will see voting rights taken away if don‚Äôt have covid card. I predict this coming. Insanity. Scary times!!!! God help us all!!! üôèüèª"
2,Criminals in commissions of Crimes often wear mask too ‚ÄúNanny Nancy‚Äù.... During the Civil War Slaves did too when they had no voice as their‚Äôs were leather and iron.... Doubt it??? Research it!!!!!
2,"Our health official in Nevada County, California referenced the Spanish Flu and jokingly held up gun fingers.

Everyone is so mad!!! We have called for his resignation. Dr. Kellerman. And our Board of Supervisors refuse to fire him for saying that publicly."
1,George Travancoor that‚Äôs why our governor relaxed rules on owning a gun. I‚Äôll be ready for anyone that tries to force a mask or a shot on or in me.
2,"Do you notice how without a mask, Pelosi is still wearing a mask?"
1,"Australia is now in the grip of dictators, my once proud free democratic country, is no more. The next step will be a license to breath."
1,It does not become any clearer than seeing it with your own eyes . The elite and power hungry are slowly sacrificing the people of this country. The second amendment was put into place to fight tyranny and tyranny we are victims of until we decide to stop playing this game.
2,"Um as I recall, Kamala started the political anti vx movement when she said ‚ÄúBut if Donald Trump tells us we should take it, I'm not going to take it.""üí©"
2,"A million little restrictions can be accepted by so many, when they can‚Äôt stand back and see the big picture."
2,"So much for wanting to visit Australia, looks a lot like North Korea now . Never give up your guns, our politicians still fear us and that is a good thing ."
1,"That‚Äôs what happens when you freely give up your guns. Sadly, this is only the beginning in Australia"
2,"WOW! The New World Order has started in every country. The elite wealthy do what they want and the rest of us are a part of the collective. We are basically told to sit down and shut your mouth you are common folk, we are nothing!"
1,When we gonna stand up and just say no????? I don‚Äôt wear one even when asked I got the Johnson shot because my wife asked me to because of her job she takes care of the elderly as an administrator at a retirement home. But the people telling us we have to wear one a mask because it‚Äôs so deadly but don‚Äôt even believe it‚Äôs that deadly them selves
1,People can‚Äôt turn their heads anymore thinking nothing can happen here! It‚Äôs happening and Nancy is leadings it. She‚Äôs crazy.
0,They make the civil rights movement come back alive in a different way
2,My daddy said his mother told him stories of the government nailing doors shut to keep people indoors in the last pandemic. Did anyone else hear of this happening?
1,They gave up their guns and that's what happens!
1,"This said it all, look how brave our leaders are not fearing the virus"
1,It's not about a virus...if it was the borders would be closed. It's about control at this point...
1,I am Australian I can see the lunacy in this and millions of Australians do but we are powerless our government has also been hijacked by leftist communist ratbags and our police became the Gestapo overnight unbelievable
2,That‚Äôs because they are all brainwashed. If people would start standing up for our freedom and our rights.
2,"Yep, it‚Äôs nuts over here. Tucker Carlson Tonight in reference to the church gathering. They were dobbed on by people for meeting. The church was fined $5000 (AUD) for having no QR Code (Registered government digital contact tracing system) and 31 individuals were fined $1000 each. The NSW Police Commissioner also said he is considering closing down the church permanently."
1,Isn't that indicative of the fact that something is going on. And you can bet that the folks in power had protection before this virus was released.
1,The government stole Australians‚Äô guns for a reason.
2,Leaders create this chaos then blame the cops who they force to control it. Notice their hands stay clean.
1,"Don't post this just on social sides post this on her page LoL.. if this would be a pandemic and be so dangerous and all this drama this witches (B) saying it is, there are the ones who would be in a bunker .. this is a control game and why is no one shows her or who ever get cut this pictures and late them explain it to us WTF THEY THINK THEY DOING .. EXPLAIN THIS where is the Covid .. so much BS makes my head spin.. and ppl believe all this covid crap"
2,Frightening how the sheep follow along... Australia is so far gone... we're not far behind.
1,But the first thing the government did in Australia is take their guns. Now they have no power to resist.
2,Why is this being tolerated by the masses??! We out number them.
2,"Those videos from Australia apply to Victoria and NSW, Most states aren't locked down, and it's certainly not nationwide. Having said that, people in Australia are pissed off about lockdiwns because the federal government refuses to address the continual leaks from hotel quarantine that are causing covid to spread."
1,"Im from Melbourne and i can confirm that this is all true, leaving your house will get you a $5000 fine but because people arnt paying the fine the government now wants to seize property to make up for it, its insane"
2,What is a ‚ÄúMild Protestant‚Äù
2,The ‚Äúslacker‚Äù who was shot was maskless in the street and a health inspector led him to a store to get a mask when the slacker hit him over the head and started beating him. The inspector shot in self defense. Both received charges. Google is free yall
1,"Terry Leef Abood you might like this. What's good for the goose isn't necessarily good for the gander. Really ticks me off seeing Pelosi and the rest trying to control my life. ""We the people"" are forgotten and in some ways dying needlessly to further their agenda."
2,They really shouldn‚Äôt be rich these dark elements in society they should prove and justify or go the hell to jail
1,the democrats are going to try and push this until the vote in 2022 mail in vote is the only way to win
2,"Where are these people who consider themselves "" elite "" going to run when the Country finally cones after them?
Like the mafia, there won't be anywhere that they can hide to escape the punishment that they brought upon themselves"
1,"America does not leave Americans behind Nor do we play nice guy with the enemy.
This is a posture of weakness. We will do what ever it takes . Stand Up Americans Wake Up

0,"Your reporting on Australia is in accurate. I am currently in Queensland where there is no Covid 19 and no restrictions, this is the same for many states. Sydney however has had an out break of Covid 19 D the state there is trying to get it under control, thus no large gatherings. The protesters were told not to go, as gatherings spread Covid. They went there with the intent to break the laws. We have been fortunate in Australia to avoid deaths from Covid and are proud to say only a few deaths not 1000s of deaths that followed uncontrolled riots like the US. Perhaps the way fwd would be to tell protesters they are banned from wearing masks then they would protest that by wearing a mask."
2,Sounding more and more like Nazi Germany by the day.
1,"If the video was in black and white, it would mimic a party on a plantation held by the good ole Southern Democratic Segregationist Party!"
1,It gives me the message that it's having trouble playing this video. This is not the first conservative video I have not been able to view on Facebook today. I think they are censoring again.
2,I can‚Äôt believe people still believe any of this show!!!!!! It‚Äôs disgusting and people need to start asking questions!!! Wake up!
2,Vote these people out of office that is how we will take the country back . Get out and vote in your local elections they are more important than we think ......
1,It‚Äôs insane my siblings live in Sweden and are in the medical field they stated they did not have tons off deaths and did not wear masks so again insanity
1,"The hypocrisy has turned into madness, thanks to the left. As usual there are no rules or laws that apply to the ruling class."
2,we all must stand together against any so called ‚Äúruling class‚Äù ‚Ä¶
2,The police in these countries need to turn on there leaders....
2,Nancy seems to be remembering the issues for the 1918 pandemic
1,Unbelievable that they still have Dr. Fauci on TV and people are again hanging on to every word he says. God help us all! Only God can save us now. Keep praying everyone! Evil will not Prevail!!
1,Government officials police and the military are now Australian super spreaders each time they speak they spread covid
2,"For those of us, who had such a hard time understanding of how the german people before ww2, could allow the insane nazis to get into control, now we know!. All it takes for evil to triumphant, is for good people to do NOTHING!. America better wake up, because we are next!. - Mark"
2,"Ok Biden can save hime self.and amercians,, The talaban is not the legt government of afganistan so launch a drone and take out all leaders of taliban and put legt government back in place."
1,Australia has gone full blown communist.
1,"Never, ever give up your guns / weapons."
1,I bet Australians wish they fought to keep their guns years ago.
1,"South Australian here, yea the states under labor control (the leftards or democrats) who have imposed the most ridiculous lock downs and rules ironically have the worst daily case numbers in our country.. im in south Australia, and we are going to work, myself in civil construction, and dont have to mask up unless being inside a shop or the likes.. its the left wing ideology thats proven to be no help, but scare and anger the people.."
0,All good here Ellen is 6 weeks or so we will be 70-80% vaccinated and things should go back to normal. It‚Äôs stressful but at least we don‚Äôt have to look back.
1,"Thank you Tucker for reporting what is happening in NZ & Australia, you are a brave man, may God bless you and keep you always"
1,Only reason the population of Australia put up with a shutdown is Australian government took all the firearms. That is why we need to fight this government and keep them from taking away the second amendment.
2,Notice those in England and Australia who are enforcing these mask mandates and lockdown are not doing the same. No masks on either
2,Tucker it's the same in Ireland üáÆüá™ the elite politicians doing the same but no vaccinated can only dine outdoor.no pass no entrance to be seated in pubs and restaurants
2,This is China all over. CCP. They do the same to their people. Such a huge overlap.
2,"Tucker, don't you know these are all sophisticated, vaccinated people that are all above us servants who are the super spreaders of the world."
2,God help us. People must take control back before this happens to us. I shudder to think what kind of life my grandchildren have to look forward to IF we don‚Äôt stop this insanity NOW!!!!
1,"Have you noticed, if you watch this on utube , it is edited! Why? The pictures are filled in with Donald Trump in the corner, not the videos/ picture of What Tucker is talking about like the Pelosi gathering without masks. Why edited?"
1,We're being conditioned to accept rules for the surfs but not for the elites. That's why they keep throwing it in our faces.
2,I was just going to say that! During Spanish flew everyone covered up. Then WW1 ended and it kinda disappeared. Everyone masked .
2,"They break their own rules every..single..
time. Stand up or this will never end. Please wake up before its too late and we're doing what Australia and New Zealand are doing"
1,Australians getting arrested for going outside

1,"Hypocrisy at its finest! they DEMAND of us, doesn‚Äôt apply to them! The thinking of leaving our American boarders WIDE OPEN is an open invitation to thousands more Covid in Texas and elsewhere! Sam Gonzales Lydia Gonzales De Vasquez what are your thoughts? Lisa Cavazos Darras Lisa Daniels Feldman"
2,"And yet nothing happens, evil is ruling, this seems like God's judgment"
2,"I have always thought Australia was one in kind with Canada discounting the weather. We here in Canada have seen similar instances in Toronto and Montreal. My main point is, are the police not there to protect and serve the people? This whole thing, even if there actually is a pandemic why brutalize your own! Nothing about these times follow any kind of straight lines. Rule changes at every turn, they say follow the science without any consultation or debate. Science now is what the government leaders say it is. Having had the illness is the best defence from ever getting it again, but that‚Äôs not very profitable and if they can break down your natural immunity with a few jabs well you might just be the next casualty and that‚Äôs worth a few bucks. To say I‚Äôm dissolutions by what has happened is putting it mildly. Well we will March on."
2,Politicians are famous for hypocrisy. This dingbat is on top of the list.
1,I think we‚Äôre all in denial this is communism. We all need to wake up
2,Didn‚Äôt Australians give up their guns awhile back?
1,"The Australian stuff sounds a lot like life here in Manitoba, until last month! Things are quite normal now, by comparison, but employers and schools are mandating vaccination. Sone of us are quite concerned about how that will play out. I think that just refusing will probably be enough. They can't legally compel us"
1,"FACT Check Tucker Carlson Tonight, ‚ÄúNo one is Australia is laughing at this, no one in Australia is standing back far enough and seeing the lunacy on display‚Äù is incorrect!!!

0,"That's funny why Carlson didn't say something when the Governor of Texas, Florida and Atlanta stop wearing mask and you see what is happening. So let's see what will happen."
1,It's because they can't have guns for defense.
2,"Hypocrisy has reached new heights in america and unacceptable.

We do not bow to the politicians who are supposedly elected to serve.

Today's out and have lost their way and believe they are designated through elections to rule.

Goes against american tried and true values no matter how many statues antifa and BLM topple"

2,What the hell is going on??? Why would people allow their country to do this???????
1,yes it is pretty bad in Australia at the moment I live in Victoria and in the last year and a half we have been in lockdown for over 200 days prisoners in our own homes you are allowed to go to the shops Within five k‚Äôs for essential items and you are allowed to go to work if you are considered an essential worker it is pretty depressing Feels like I have wasted the last year and a half of my life gotten absolutely nowhere done nothing that is why there was protests over the weekend because a lot of us are about to snap yeah this is not the Australia I grew up in it is hard to watch it‚Äôs not right

2,Hardly a diverse crowd amongst the non help either... not really seeing many border crossers welcome.
2,"The scary thing is, is that here in Australia the media, ALL MSM is demonising the protesters.
They are giving them outrageous negative publicity.
These are the people that are going to save us, not hinder us.

2,"Hey Tucker, love your show but you got it wrong about Aussie bloke sneezing in lift. Remember TYPHOID MARY - they locked her up in isolation for 20 years because she refused to isolate. This bloke is contagious and refuses to quarantine or self isolate. So I have no problem with them locking him up in forced quarantine (comparison to FEMA camps etc is a bit silly, really. It is just 2 weeks isolation which many countries are enforcing, and if he cops a fine or jail term for breaking the law, so what). Yes our Govt is insane, but that's because, unlike most of the world, they are still aiming for ZERO COVID, which is rapidly slipping through their inept fingers. And high school kids were NOT forced to vaccinate without parents in a stadium - it was totally voluntary, and many opted to not vaccinate. There is enough crap going on in the world to expose, without hyping stuff up - it just diminishes your credibility. Disappointed, but still a big fan :)"

Hmmm is San Francisco reistaling that law? Asking for a friend.
‚ÄòSerious breach of decorum‚Äô ?? Isn‚Äôt that the equivalent of eating a salad with the big fork?!?

What a trashy human being.
New Zealand is run by a woke communist its sad
The hipocracy though it's disgusting and appalling is not New or a Surprise!! On the plus side we can be happy they will ALL go down in history as liers, cheaters, hypocrites and crooks!!! My opinion of course.
Love your work Tucker Carlson Tonight but, we have 8 states in Australia, not every state is in lockdown, they like to take it in turns ü§£ currently NSW and Victoria are in lockdown, a couple of other states just have a mask mandate whilst indoors but you are free to move around, as long as you dont want to move around your country as most borders are shut and wont let you in.üôÑ

2,Are media using the word servant on purpose?
2,too far gone America on it's way at warp speed
1,Obama had a Birthday party with possibly 600 guests of the rich and famous type and nobody wore masks. Mandates don't really apply to the elite in the democrat party or to some of their RINO friends because the mask mandate is about having power and control over others. The jews were forced to wear a yellow star on their clothing when outside.
2,"Decorum???
So they admit mandates are purely a matter of ‚Äúgood taste‚Äù, ‚Äúpolite behavior‚Äù, and/
noun
the state or quality of conforming to conventionally accepted standards of behavior or morals.

And has nothing to do with actual necessities??? üòí"

These charges are all dismissed in court too, police were caught on a hot mic admitting that the rules were BS."

It was true then, but not so much today. Fully half this country are sleazy hypocrites. It's not just leaders that you've shown us, I've seen dozens of pictures of liberal friends partying without masks. Recently, when they were publicly chastising people for not wearing them.

I did not hear that the Australian Police State shot and killed dogs merely to stop people from travelling to rescue them That's disgusting, and I know that liberals here would love that. They don't care about dogs, about kids, about race, about anything other than themselves and their own power"

These draconian rules are being enforced by the army & the police on the streets. People being asked to report others to Crime Stoppers for breaching COVID rules. This has nothing to do with health, it‚Äôs total control of the masses & we are slowly turning into a Penal Colony and all to force every Australian to get the vaccine whether they want it or not.

And as anyone who's watched Fox knows, its fundamental message is rage at what liberals are doing to our country. Over the years the specific message has changed with the times ‚Äî from terrorism to open borders to Benghazi to Christian cake bakers to critical race theory ‚Äî but it's always about what liberal politicians are doing to cripple America, usually with a large dose of thinly veiled racism to give it emotional heft...

The Fox pipeline is pretty simple. Fox News stokes a constant sense of outrage among its base of viewers, largely by highlighting narratives of white resentment and threats to Christianity. This in turn forces Republican politicians to follow suit. It's a positive feedback loop that has no obvious braking system, and it's already radicalized the conservative base so much that most Republicans literally believe that elections are being stolen and democracy is all but dead if they don't take extreme action."" - Unknown"

They have left themselves with no choice, except to annihilate their enemies, or be annihilated, & that is exactly how they behave - like all the Palestinians must be annihilated, all their land taken, in order for Israel to exist, at all. That is a corner they backed themselves into - when they showed no willingness to show compassion to their fellow humans, or seek out peace, thru diplomacy - always resorting to brute force to achieve purely selfish ends, instead of cultivating peaceful relations, in a land they reside in, thanks only to the concessions others have made, on their behalf.

Joe Biden- leave the Taliban alone.
The Obama administration,
otherwise known as the Muslim brotherhood, is running this country right now. You can almost see the foreign influence in his speeches, his actions, his INACTION."

1,She is the only one I ever seen get mad and out of control at a trump rallie..
1,Why are these anti Americans given so much power???!!!
1,Did biden just meet with Israel and promised to keep the program going. Everything this administration has said they would do has been just the opposite of those promises
1,"Yeah but that kind of money, is same as possessing it ,which we don't want ....... as usual islam attacks 1cause of poverty ,pollution, rapes,drugs etc."
2,"I'm aware on how effective the Iron Dome is. How it even benefits Palestinians. Still, I gotta ask...

How massive is the debt in Israel? Why is the USA funding the Iron Dome replenishment? Am I missing something, is funding some metaphor I'm unfamiliar with? I'd think Iron Dome is something important enough that Israel would fund it without handouts from Uncle Sam."
2,Pelosi AND THE SQUAD DID THIS .....all votes for this Bill...are vote to DESTROY Israel...every democrat or republican
1,It is sad so sad. They are using their religious beliefs to cloud their judgment

2,We should not give Israel anything.
1,"What is that saying? Give them enough rope? If the government is shut down because of something four or 5 representatives
oppose, and most of the nation supports, it falls squarely on them."
2,Why is Biden allowing Americans to be punching bags to illegals crossing border?
1,"These 4 Hags should be removed from government, and exported to the middle east."
0,"Anti.Semitism will NOT win. AOC, Pressley, Omar, Tlaib will not prevail. They are evil."
2,No more handouts from Republicans
1,"The elites are segregating allied nations‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre preparing to bring America down. Weakening us by turning us weak, sexually confused, unarmed, sick, broke and broken. Meanwhile, China is getting stronger"
2,The far left anti semite hypocrites are a danger to America and are more than likely radicalized Muslims the squad must be conquered and deported if possible

1,These Anti-Americans need removed. But that‚Äôs what happens when you settle refugees to turn an election.
1,"""Liberals, progressives, Democrats and other rational thinkers must accept one crucial reality if they are to save America's democracy: Those who live in the right-wing echo chamber really do believe what they are being told. Those beliefs are now extensions of their core identities...

And as anyone who's watched Fox knows, its fundamental message is rage at what liberals are doing to our country. Over the years the specific message has changed with the times ‚Äî from terrorism to open borders to Benghazi to Christian cake bakers to critical race theory ‚Äî but it's always about what liberal politicians are doing to cripple America, usually with a large dose of thinly veiled racism to give it emotional heft...

The Fox pipeline is pretty simple. Fox News stokes a constant sense of outrage among its base of viewers, largely by highlighting narratives of white resentment and threats to Christianity. This in turn forces Republican politicians to follow suit. It's a positive feedback loop that has no obvious braking system, and it's already radicalized the conservative base so much that most Republicans literally believe that elections are being stolen and democracy is all but dead if they don't take extreme action."" - Unknown"
2,US will help Australia with nuclear submarines but will not help Israel with their needs. Biden and Harris administration disaster and blunders.
0,"Don't think she has the power to ""gut"" the bill alone. With that being said why are we funding Israel's defense?"
1,"This is a blatant attempt to put Israeli citizens in harms way by reducing their protection from the rockets fired from outside their borders... The ""Squad"" would like nothing better than to see Jews killed!!"
2,Less educated MAGA morons don‚Äôt wanna America contributing foreign aid so no aid to Israel.
1,Can't we just impeach that Cucking Funt?
0,"Why is this a project to be funded by US taxpayers? We already send Israel 3 bn a year, every year, in perpetuity. Why do they need more? Why do they need any at all? We have domestic issues to solve."
1,Far left lunatics üòÇü§°üòÇü§°üñïüèª
0,The agenda continues . The evil media convinced Americans to support the demise of democracy and Israel. This is just the beginning of their agenda!
2,"She and her ilk are abhorrent, Democrats just pulled funding from the Iron Dome‚Äîthe missile defense system that has saved countless lives in Israel from Hamas' rocket attacks. While Democrats capitulate to the antisemitic influence of their radical members, Republicans will always stand with Israel."
0,Night news FOR
1,"how these ""people"" got elected..I may never understand!! oh wait, maybe the same way Sleepy Joe did.. hmm that's an interesting theory..."
2,Yeah let's see if we could be a little more clueless Fox News. Maybe you missed the point where they said there was no point in funding it with the deficit cap bill because it's already part of a defense bill that's going to be passed later this year so there was no need to tack it on twice. Nobody said it's not getting funded it's just not going to be funded with this bill then with the other bill later when it's already been approved with the defense bill that going to be passed in December
1,The squad of four idiot enemies we allow in our government.
2,They want the Jewish people to die that's why. This is sick.
1,"1. You want us to quit aiding other countries, but you don't. We absolutely defend Israel with 3.8 billion already. They are the richest country in that region.
2. You want to talk about abandoning allies. Trump was the first and only U.S. President to abandon our allies on the field of battle, abandon a U.S. base and turn them both over to our arch enemy Russia, who rolled in the next day. Trump got no Kurds out of Syria, not one. The ISIS prisoners then released following this betrayal were quite likely some of the same ones who later planned the attack and killed 13 U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.
Wake up."
2,Terrible enemies from with in. Say goodbye to your American way of life.
1,"The jihadi snakes that hijacked the democratic party hate to see Israel defending themselves. During the last cycle of violence between Israel and Hamas, the jihadi terror organization had launched over 4000 UNGUIDED rockets on Israeli cities. Thankfully, the iron dome has prevented a total holocaust against the little Jewish state. In the next war, without the defense of iron dome Israel will be forced to take it's gloves off and respond propotionally to the threat in order to win the war and ensure the safety of it's people"
1,"If Israel is allowed to fall to its enemies,you will be looking at world war three."

2,The squad is nothing but terrorists sympathizers
2,I‚Äôm definitely not far left‚Ä¶.. but maybe it‚Äôs time for Israel to actually PAY for its own weapons
2,Israel can pay for his own defense program
2,"Raytheon produces the rockets used by the Iron Dome. That $1B goes to the defense contractor, who then starts production, keeping American citizens working. They fill the order and ship the product to Israel. The money doesn't actually leave the country. So, now they'll be unable to replenish the Iron Dome. Leaving the most important American ally defenseless like that is reprehensible"
1,"If the Republicans don‚Äôt do something about these traitor squad members, this country will be gone to their craziness. WHY isn‚Äôt ANYONE doing something to stop these crazy, unAmerican terrorists???"

0,They had better be careful about how they treat Israel God is watching
2,Never forget that the Muslim president brought them in and Democrats voted them in office. God said pray for Israel. Marxists democratic government wants to remove God because the government is to be worshipped.
0,The Iron Dome also saves Palestinian lives as it is a defensive system and by using it Israel can afford to be more tolerant when attacked by the jihadists
1,They are all disgusting and anti Israel they are our ally.
2,It‚Äôs what communist do
