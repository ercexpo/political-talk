2,"Thank you. So important to not let our like of other aspects of a person (policies, etc.) prevent us from holding them accountable to harms they‚Äôve caused."
2,"Although I agree Gov. Cuomo's behavior seemed inappropriate at times & probably is best if he stepped down, don't think of the accounts I've heard that anything was criminal or against the law. Maybe he will find some other work as he seems like a very decent man. Hoping the new governor Kathy Hochul will do good for the great state of New York."
0,"They elected a man who said he grabbed them by the p***y‚Ä¶.yeah, we have a long way to go."
2,I still say he made trump look bad during the first Covid and he's getting payback. I notice that women always believe women. I'm not convinced this time. I think she's (the one all over tv) is collecting a big paycheck. Just my humble opinion.
0,"Well said, the ""lack of transparency"", there is nothing worse than to be blindsided by a system that you trust. It should be a 2 way window with our government and it's; our officials, that we as citizens have elected to speak our voice, on our terms, our agreed terms as citizens. Thank you for your efforts, AOC all the way!"
0,Cuomo - give me a break - the line has moved! Only for you. We women have stood strong for so long along a line that you determined fit your needs. Your line is leading you out the door of the Governor‚Äôs mansion and office!!
2,We should also not elect abusers to become president
0,"Trump should have resigned also. Yet his supporters, wealthy white men could not let that happen. Side note, I am truly sorry for the abuse you are enduring from those around you. I bless the path you are on, and admire your perseverance in the face of assault. Be safe. Your life is too precious."
2,"Sometimes people don‚Äôt tell the truth, and that‚Äôs okay to admit as well. This abuser vs. abused binary is divisive and leaves 0 room for nuance. Sometimes trauma makes us believe something is happening that isn‚Äôt actually happening. That‚Äôs called psychic equivalence, and it‚Äôs a real thing, and it is not victim-blaming.
And no, that‚Äôs not the case all the time, but it does happen ‚Ä¶ a lot. We are entirely abandoning reality with these victim axioms as if there is no way on earth that there‚Äôs another side to things. THAT is just as well the first step toward totalitarianism
."
0,"I was so worried about how you would handle this. Need to clarify that you have no real responsibility to be vocal about business that‚Äôs not your own however as a political (really in career only‚Ä¶. And I mean that as a compliment) you have been and frequently do voice yourself opinions‚Ä¶. A lot, if not all, are not lunacy and I agree with. But as a fellow Democrat I worried you would stay silent, thank you for being unbiased by party. You are a shining example of how to be a public servant"
0,"And people wonder why victims don‚Äôt report right away. The response is so often that they are lying, don‚Äôt know how social interaction works, or were asking for the abuse. Can we stop allowing these powerful men to defend themselves on national television in this pathetic and manipulative way?"
2,"Biden said Cuomo did a hell of a job, except personally. There's the way Cuomo governed and another way he acted in a purely personal capacity that had nothing to do with being governor. And ""Our American Cousin"" was a hell of a play and a fine presentation by Ford's theater until John Wilkes Booth interrupted it halfway through. Patrons never even got their money back. And that's what's so sad, as Biden noted."
0,How about trump and Gaetz and Kavanaugh? Why are they not held accountable!?
1,We live in a hypocritical society where we rant against the police for treating certain POC as being guilty before facing justice of his or her peers in the court of law.. Are all not innocent until proven guilty in a court of law?
2,"Very well said. You are a true hero, not only to the district you represent, but also for all people that deserve better. We need more like you in our government. Get it, Queen."
0,"I agree fully, but why are only Democrats held accountable for their actions?"
0,Thank you. The sexual violence and abuse by powerful men can no longer be ignored.
0,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unrelated I know.
I‚Äôm from the UK and haven‚Äôt heard any official speak about what‚Äôs happening with Line 3.

A treaty is currently being broken, US law enforcement paid by the Canadian oil company for man power.
The indigenous need help along with many endangered species that rely on that water."
0,Well he is guilty like the former Orange Man female genitalia grabber. And all those who cover for them are abuser too.
0,"For every courageous women who refuse to be abused in silence there are multiples who still live in fear and suffering, they must feel safe to come forward, also there must be sever consequences for those who help the harasser cover up"
0,"I'm still waiting for the media and democrats to pressure Congressman Matt Gaetz to do the same and also legally force Trump's hand to submit his DNA in a possible rape case. Cuomo resigning is a win, and his replacement looks very promising comparably, but we need to pressure the other side of the aisle enough to get similar results."
0,"I love this. As a fellow Democrat I'm glad he resigned but am disappointed he seemed to feel no remorse, and took no blame. We have to be the party to take the higher ground, because we know they never will."
0,"I‚Äôm in awe of how AOC (or the person who runs her account) can articulate the modern complexities of civil rights. I do wish he was around to progress the Trump cases,I‚Äôm hoping it gets done with the same fortitude."
2,I don‚Äôt agree he should not have resigned. He was good for the state and got things done. This is the first time I have ever disagreed with AOC.
1,"Once again, the Democrats eat their young while Republicans revel in delight. I wonder how we'll all feel when a Republican wins the governorship and Trump gets a NY pardon."
2,Agreed. I was disappointed in his statement about the line being ‚Äúredrawn‚Äù. It‚Äôs a face saving excuse and he needs to drop that and admit he knew he could flex his power over women because he‚Äôs been the governor. We need truth.
2,"Totalitarianism
doesn‚Äôt work without the introduction of delusional psychosis.
Also, narcissism."
0,"Thank you AOC, for helping blow the dust and cobwebs off institutions of power that have operated in the shadows for too long. Your courage is contagious and very much needed right now. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
0,"I agree with everything you said. But I am getting tired of the Dems always being the ones to stand up and take their own out for this type of BS behavior, while the GOP ignore it and let it continue and refuse to do the same with their own. We need to force them to do the same!"
2,We won‚Äôt forget how you forced Cuomo out with zero due process. Absolutely shameful. You will never hold higher office.
2,You need to recommrnd to your supporters what preferences to give for Mayor

1,"Anybody else notice that Dems have been running America‚Äôs cities and inner cities for 3-4 generations and havent fixed them yet? As a matter of fact they continue to get worse‚Ä¶worse schools, more homelessness, more crime, etc. Yet Dems want you to believe they have more, new ideas that will fix the mess they created. So isn‚Äôt voting D like the definition of insanity?"

2,I remember last year how you helped Ed Markey get reelected to the Senate and saw you on TV with my Congressman Seth Moulton this morning.
0,i love AOC...perhaps the most anti-American congresswoman in the U.S. Bella Abzug would whip her butt for all the bad things she says about the nation. I hope she gives up riding in a car or flying in a jet between DC and NYC. She should walk her way into the Green New Feel! AOC for Prez.

2,How about some personal accountability for the people that are breaking the law and putting themselves into this
2,"Please don‚Äôt continue to support the very system your party now has ostensible power over. The drones, the detentions, the platitudes about common ground with those without human compassion or decency. You were one of the few who gave average people hope. Don‚Äôt be Fredo I beg of you. Don‚Äôt break our hearts."
2,"Pouring gas on a fire. Investigation barely even begun. You're part of the problem, you're helping grow a ""guilty until Proven Innocent"" society. Unless it meets your agenda of course.
Shame on you."
2,"I am angry and appalled at the recent events involving police and deaths of young black men. With that out of the way,I am the mother of a hard working, caring, good police officer who puts his life in danger on a very consistent basis. While those that do wrong should without a doubt be punished, let's not forget that there are more good cops than bad ones. Recruitment of police officers in this day and age is a challenge and it doesn't help that they are not paid enough for what they do either. Just remember to judge the individual for their actions and not every cop on the beat. I sincerely hope to see change to make everyone safer"
2,It‚Äôs a tragic incident for all parties involved.. so sad he had to resist and cause the escalation.
1,Way to incite violence Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A mistake that cost someone their life and was admitted to by the cop. End of story.
0,It is always right to criticize law enforcement in the United States. People think it's a crime -- especially after -- but it's a right.
0,"I heard a report today that none of the Brooklyn Center police force actually live in the community. If this is true, this is also a problem. A community's police department should reflect the community in which they protect and serve. This won't solve everything, but if the police are of the people of their community, they may have a different level of investment in its people. And more good police need to call out bad police."
2,"Question is , what are you politicians doing about it , or do you prefer to talk just enough to get re-elected? Do what they need you to do instead of saying it if you really want to make a difference! Once election season come around we the people Hear and watch nothing but promises and no action !"
1,"At the same time why not educate the ppl not to flee and obey the officers orders, in most cases at the max you would be arrested, warned or cited for wrong doing. But if you have a warrant ofcourse they arrest you. Obeying officers orders was one of things I was taught by my seniors when I arrived into US into 2006. Hope the young and vulnerable learn a lesson in addition to better training and rules for the officers to bring a positive change in the society. Bashing each other and politicizing the issue will only make mattes worse. Side note that kid at 20 should be in college not parenting a 2yr old boy, thats a broader problem this cntry has to address."
1,Just another reminder that it‚Äôs a dangerous profession being a criminal and resisting arrest. Let‚Äôs hold the criminals as accountable as we all want police to be.
1,"It was an unfortunate accident. At the end of the day the main lesson that should be learned from all of these unfortunate events is, ( stop resisting arrest). It will never end well. You fight the arrest in court, not on the street. Stop pointing the finger and take some personal accountability.
If you really want to lead Ms. Cortez, then this should be your message. I know you have good intentions, but you're going at this from the wrong direction."
2,"Your comments are not based on on emotion and presumption. The facts in this case do not support your assertions.This is very irresponsible behavior from a public figure and I would expect that people in positions of power and influence would feel the need to hold themselves to a higher standard. Great leaders seek the facts and stand up for what is right even when it is not popular. They bring people together, they don't divide and instigate."
2,His mistake costs him his life. Her mistake gets her early retirement with a pension and a chance to double dip with another police dept.
2,Or.. It was a criminal with a warrant resisting arrest who unfortunately was shot during a tragic
2,"The actual investigation has barely started. She admitted her mistake verbally on body cam. She resigned, she will be going to court. Ppl so negative b4 anything has even happened."
0,"The real way to end this type of crap is:
- Remove qualified immunity.
- Require ALL officers to carry $1M in malpractice insurance just like doctors and lawyers.
- Tie civil awards to the police retirement fund. Example: If there is a $3M award for misconduct $1M comes from the officer's insurance and the $2M comes from the retirement fund and NOT the tax payers.
- Create a national database of discredited officers (just like they do with lawyers and doctors) so if they apply for another law enforcement position their past WILL follow them."
2,How about people comply with the officers orders. Do not resist
0,"Excuse me for saying so, but it seems a bit odd that a woman who has been a police officer for 26yrs would 'mistakenly' draw her gun thinking it was her taser, if she doesn't know the difference between the two after 26yrs then she shouldn't be a cop at all and she sure as hell shouldn't be excused, or forgiven, for making such a stupid, not to mention fatal, rookie mistake..."
2,She should not be allowed to keep her pension!
0,how does a 25 year veteran not know the difference between a GUN and a Taser? O r better still how do they not know that the punishment for expired tags or misdemeanors is still NOT DEATH.
1,"...says the socialist who wants to increase state violence, authority, and spending."
2,Definitely a tragedy and avoidable. Maybe not run from the cops also. That might help
0,"The reason the cops pulled Daunte Wright over: He had an air freshener dangling from his mirror which was supposedly blocking his view.

I feel like that part of the story doesn‚Äôt get enough attention. Really makes you wonder if they were just looking for a reason to pull people over."
0,"Let‚Äôs not forget the mass proliferation of guns among USA citizens...so that police fear being killed with every racially profiled pull over. You can thank the misinterpretati

2,Time to end qualified immunity.
1,Tip of the day: Don‚Äôt fight with the police if you don‚Äôt want to get shot.
2,"When our grandchildrens grandchildren won't be able to pay back what we spent, it's too much. Especially when the entity responsible for ""fixing the problem"" is well known for its past great successes like the war on drugs, the war on terror, the war on poverty, etc."
2,Funny they never say it's too much when waging war.
2,Too much is when you decimate the American economy and send manufacturing jobs overseas only to create even worse pollution on the other side of the earth. Too much is when the government spends seniors SS money on programs to create more dependent voters. Too much is when govt overregulates businesses including child care facilities so much that they need a lawyer in house to navigate those laws/ regulations.
0,Bernie is not radical. He's just a honest to god democrat. The corporate lobbies just hate the truth. What made america great was a strong middle class not a handful of billionaires. Reasonable people need to vote. Not just the clowns.

while the news man tells you war is normal,
while Hollywood tells you the system is working perfectly,
while armed police guard grocery store dumpsters full of food from the hungry,
while executives go on five billion-dollar space rides for fun,
while you live surrounded by screens that tell you you are crazy

Side effects may include compliance,
acquiescence, subservience, docility,

a marked lack of interest in guillotines,
a dystopian society and a dying biosphere.

think tank says war is good for the environment,
but first here's a millionaire to explain the benefits of urinating on the homeless.""

and fill the room with water
and then shame us for drowning
and then charge us for tiny gasps of air

that they are destroying as quickly as they can.

And hey I've invented a new antidepressant anti-anxiety antipsychotic
that I'm getting to market as quickly as I can.
It's not a pill or a jab or an electrical shock treatment,
it's just a big wad of cash taken by force from thieving megacorporation

Side effects may include peace and relaxation,
an ability to buy food and think clearly,
a fondness for red flags,
and a hysterical corporate media.

And hey I think we just might make it,

2,"Bernie Sanders
Are you ready for a radical statement? I happen to think that Joe Manchin is right. Yeah, physical infrastructure is terribly important. But I happen to think that the needs of the human beings of our country ‚Äî working families, the children, the elderly, the poor ‚Äî are even more important, and we can and must do both.
Look, everybody in America ‚Äî whether you're Republican, Democrat or independent ‚Äî understands that, for the last many years, the very richest people in this country and the largest corporations have done phenomenally well, while the working class and the middle class of this country struggle, and we have got close to 600,000 people sleeping out on the streets.

Elderly people in America can't afford to put dentures into their mouth. They have no teeth in their mouth in some cases, can't afford hearing aids, can't afford eyeglasses. Working families cannot afford child care for their kids. Young people cannot afford to go to college.

And then on top of all of that, the scientific community is telling us that we're looking at a cataclysmic crisis in terms of climate. Oregon is burning. California is burning.

People are drowning in New York City. Detroit is flooding. Siberia has seen the largest fire on Earth. Drought is happening in places all over the world.

The United States must lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel. This is a crisis we are living in.

So, what polling tells us is that working families all over this country understand that NOW is the time for Congress to address the long neglected problems facing working families. Now is the time to have the wealthy and large corporations -- we've got billionaires in this country who don't pay a nickel in federal income tax.
So, I think we can do all of this. We can do the physical infrastructure.
We can do the reconciliation bill, create millions of good jobs, and finally tell the American people that we are going to stand up for working families ‚Äî not just the rich and the powerful. Let's get it done.

Reminder: The actual cost of the Build Back Better Act is not $3.5 trillion, it's $0. The funding working families need is going to be paid for by taxing the wealthiest and corporations."

2,"Bernie ur great, but u been saying the same stuff for years, & nothing been done.

So here's a NEW IDEA.
Can u & ur colleagues start referring to health insurance has a SOCIALIST CONCEPT, and belongs in a SOCIALIST MODEL.

Just saying it's a human right is fine, but that doesn't move the needle to much. U have to get ppl to see the logic, and change their minds. And u can do that better, by exposing the health insurance companies by doing the messaging this way.

How do health insurance companies make money?

They collect premiums r deny ppl coverage. THAT'S IT! And if u think about that, what is that, that's a SOCIALIST CONCEPT. If the CEO of XYZ insurance company is not happy making $5 million a year, they want to make 50 millon a year, what do they have to do, r the only thing they can do, is raise PREMIUMS r DENY ppl coverage. THAT'S IT. That's a socialist CONCEPT & belongs in a socialist MODEL. If u put a SOCIALIST concept into a CAPITALIST model, it will butt heads. It will not be as efficient r effective. And that's what we have now. And vice verse, u don't want a CAPITALIST concept in a SOCIALIST model. Otherwise, we'll all be waiting hours in line for stale bread. It's not like the CEO of walmart, if they want to make more money, they have to sell more, r be more efficient in their operations.Thus
, CAPITALIST CONCEPT, belongs in CAPITALIST MODEL. Same goes for health insurance companies. It's a SOCIALIST CONCEPT, & belongs in a SOCIALIST MODEL. Bcuz all they can do to make more money is raise premiums & deny ppl coverage. And that puts the squeeze on patients & doctors.

If u do the messaging this way, this will move the needle more to universal health insurance, bcuz ppl will see the truth & logic. Instead of just saying it's a human right, which it is, but to get more ppl to believe in universal health insurance, u need to do the messaging this way. A socialist CONCEPT belongs in a socialist MODEL. At minimum it should be non-profit.

I have some good ideas how to make to get this point across. And I'm sure, if u start this messaging, it will get done. Start beating the Republicans at their own game."

,"Immigrants and refugees are on the rise throughout Latin America. The background is the natural disasters and political instability that occurred in neighboring poor countries, and the economic difficulties caused by the spread of the new coronavirus. Many immigrants and refugees will eventually head for the United States, which can be a challenge for the Biden administration.
In late August, a large number of immigrants from Haiti, a Caribbean island nation, flooded in front of the Office of the National Migration Agency in Tapachula, Chiapas, a town near the southern border of Mexico. ""Mexico, Panama and Colombia already have immigrants from Haiti and will continue to grow,"" one of them told local media. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the region. Haiti was on the way to recovery from the 2010 earthquake, which killed more than 300,000 people, and another magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck on August 14. Many homes were destroyed in Haiti, killing more than 2,200 people. In July, the incumbent President Jovenel Mo√Øse was assassinated in Haiti. In Haiti, as security deteriorates, it is likely that more and more people will want to leave the country. The Colombian and Panama governments have agreed to deepen office-level collaboration and help increase immigrants from Haiti. Immigrants from Nicaragua are rushing to Costa Rica in Central America. According to Nicaragua's local newspaper, La Prensa, the number of Nicaraguan immigrants reached 5699 in July, nearly four times the number in May (1485). Nicaragua is preparing for the presidential election in November this year. The anti-American leftist Daniel Ortega administration is strengthening its stance of power, such as detaining the opposition presidential candidates one after another, and more and more people are seeking a place to go abroad. To date, Venezuela has become the largest ‚Äúsending country‚Äù for migrants and refugees in Latin America. Venezuela is one of the leading oil-producing countries in Latin America, but the failure of the anti-American leftist government has caused security problems and food shortages, and about 3.9 million people have fled the country. Refugees from Venezuela are the second largest number in the world after long-standing conflict in Syria in the Middle East. In many cases, Latin American immigrants once head to neighboring countries in the region and then eventually head to the United States. The number of immigrants detained in July on the southwestern border of the United States was 212,672. The US media reports that it is the highest in the last 21 years. Today, the southern border of the United States is often illegally crossed from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico in Central America. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), more than 18.35 million people are being displaced in Latin America by the end of 2020. This number accounts for about 20% of the world total (about 82.4 million people). While the world is focused on increasing refugees from Afghanistan, where the Islamist Taliban came to power, Latin American migrants and refugees are also a major issue.

1,"Russia is about to make a killing and they have Joe Biden to thank for it. After he cancelled the Keystone Pipeline, he then lifted all sanctions on the Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline that runs from Russia to Germany. They will soon be able to sell their excess gas to Europe at a time when gas prices have increased 250%.
During the Trump administration,
we achieved energy independence and we were selling the surplus overseas. Joe Biden has drug us back to the dependency on foreign oil, where we buy oil from countries that hate us. Gasoline prices in the United States have increased by about 50%."
2,"Total Big 6 pharma profits: 50 Billion dollars.

Union pension bailout: 86 Billion dollars.

Now who is bribing whom to get a pension bailout on the taxpayers back greater than the total profits of the 6 largest pharma companies Bernie?"
1,Why isnt congress doing more to cap campaign contributions? Why are you allowing congress to be bribed? Why arent you furious that Biden froze the legislation to reduce costs?
1,"Bernie, you're a rich, fear-mongering tool. Most of what you post is lies. America will never be a communist country, no matter how hard you try. Now, how about you open up your 3 homes to illegals and the homeless??"
2,"There is no ""market"" for pharmaceuticals

That is why companies can charge whatever they want."

1,What about big pharmas power and money grab through the use of vaccine passports and their attack on democracy. Are you going to tackle them on that issue Bernie?
2,"The fact that HCQ and Ivermectin were taken off market is proof that the Covid measures taken by governments and the medical extorsion racket are crimminal.

Ivermectin is on the WHO list of essential medicines for human beings and was always an easy, inexpensive, and most important very effective treatment for Covid and which leads the patient to natural immunity.

At this point and with our knowledge, any doctor or hospital who does not prescribe Ivermectin for Covid is an egregious crimminal fraud and murderer.

Ivermectin would have spared 80% of deaths and hospitalization
s.

But using Ivermectin would have ruined the for-profit gravy train of these psychopath medical industry and government murderers.

2,"In Australia I had gestational diabetes 2 years ago, I was given 6 x boxes of Novorapid insulin pens (5 in a box so 30 insulin cartridges) for a grand total of $40 for the lot. I had so much left over when the diabetes went away because my baby was born. I just gave it back to the pharmacy for safe disposal as it‚Äôs so cheap here no one is in need of it. I did think it was such a sad situation as there are so many actually dying in America because they need it and I couldn‚Äôt even give it away, it just went in a pharmacy disposal bin"
2,"I just paid over $900 for a life changing migraine medicine because I hit a medication cap that I didn't know existed on my fairly good insurance plan. I picked it up because I can't fathom going back to having a migraine almost every day, but I don't know how I'm going to keep paying for it."
2,"Every single citizen in the United States does nothing but play a game of chicken with their medical concerns on a daily basis.

If someone‚Äôs going to steal my hard earned money in the form of taxes, making sure that I have medical support when needed is the one and only thing that I would say that it‚Äôs justified for."
2,"Let‚Äôs go into drugs that you can‚Äôt even get, at any price, in the us."
2,Everything in Michigan is triple! From meds to one of the highest auto insurance rates in the country! It sucks over here
2,Insulin is free in Ireland. You are not punished for having a long term condition.
2,"If only the wealthy can afford the necessary drugs to stay alive, that pretty much tells us all we need to know about our nation' leaders!!!!"
2,This is certainly one thing we agree on. It‚Äôs upsetting. My heart goes out to those who rely on critical medication. As a veteran.. I‚Äôve had my own unfavorable experiences with our system.
2,"I say we don't negotiate. We tell them the price or they don't get another dime in ""research, development or testing"" funding, no tax breaks either. Tired of our tax dollars funding private business. Our entire healthcare system is peppered with greed and corruption."
2,Insulin is cheaper if you bypass your insurance and use a prescription card.
2,"Please fix this issue, and healthcare in general. I for one have lost everything I own due to cancer diagnosis. I have a cost of almost $1,000,000 for treatments in less than 2 years.

You should have to sacrifice quality of life for quantity"
2,Change to keto diet and you can lower your insulin dose completely. See the science.
2,"Most people don't understand the outrageously high cost of medical care & pharmaceuticals
until they're in that boat."
2,"Here is how I think it works: greedy rich hire lawyers, lawyers bribe judges and legislators, judges and legislators pass or block bills or amendments to get more money for greedy rich. I would like to put all four of them in prison.
Next, vote in new Judges and Legislators.
Next, repeat till we get better Judges and Legislators that are not taking bribery anymore."
2,"Make the other countries pay more so ours isn't so outrageously high.

Not all of that money goes to profits.

R&D, manufacturing, distribution...

2,Good luck with it ! Most politicians are getting kickbacks from them!!
2,Then Bernie how bout you get all the ass holes in Congress and the senate and the POTUS to stop taking money from big pharmaceutical companies! Then they will have no power and you may actually pass something against that. Until then nothing changes
2,Imagine my shock today when my senior friend was quoted $4k for hearing aids that he desperately needs! We Can Do Better!!!! Seniors need help!
2,I have been behind elderly who leave their prescriptions at the pharmacy counter because they can‚Äôt afford to pay. This needs fixed.
2,Do you think the mafia could just buy Canadian insulin in bulk at $12 a shot then smuggle into the U.S. and sell for I don't know $22? I'm just saying it would be a good scheme and I'm pretty sure it would be legal
2,"Good luck with that. The pharma companies have your boss and pretty much all of your colleagues on both sides of aisle in their back pocket, as well as the FDA."
2,"The system is so chronic. Wealthiest country in the world, producing own vaccine, but voters allowed to be ripped off. The vaccine costs less than half in other countries who imported the same vaccine."
2,Thank heaven for our PBS and Medicare in Australia. Making huge profits from sick people is cowardly.
2,Wait.... so the vaccines have nothing to do with the *greed* of the pharmaceutical industry... Right... got it. Stay consistent Bernie!!
2,"Why are the lawmakers so susceptible to m the lobbies, I wish lobbies weren't permitted. Especially since they have had detrimental effects on the public, ( i.e. big Parma, NRA, Tobacco, Auto industry, to name just a few). It amounts to greed by lawmakers."
2,"We should add, manufactured and then shipped from what country. USA üá∫üá≤. Pathetic we charge our own citizens more."
2,Heard you today on tv...I can tell your fed up of the GOP alright...they are on their own side...I work with one and he is the most callus person I have ever met. Sad he would sell his best friend on his death bed if he could while claiming he is a Christian
2,It feels like we have lost. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. The vast majority of all US citizens that go into the field of medicine do it for the money and NOT to help people or better themselves. All patients are commodities to be exploited especially the dying - maximum profit!
2,Open the border for Canadians to come to the US ! Canada has over 70 % double vaccination rate ! What is the hold up ? I haven't seen my family in over 21 month & they live only one hour over the border. Why can people fly but not drive to the US.
2,"Hey Bernie Sanders
Canadian here, we're pushing for full head to toe universal Pharmacare. High time the people push back. It can't be done alone"

0,I can‚Äôt understand why our lawmakers can‚Äôt support Sen. Bernie on this issue about exorbitant price of US prescription drugs
2,"Dude, you didn't seem bothered when states where offering incentives to take the vaccines. I've been saying this all along...do we truly care for people's health or just COVID-19 deaths?"
2,"I thought it be free in Canada. shame... Bernie pleace stop comparing the USA to other nations, USA is superior to all other nations by far"

2,We‚Äôre tired of paying American politicians the highest price on the planet. It‚Äôs probably why insulin prices are the highest. Makes sense huh?
2,"The difference is our 700 military bases around the planet. You know, ""for keeping us safe."""
0,"How about including everyone who pays into Medicare through payroll deductions already, in the Medicare program, regardless of age?
How much does a Medicare patient pay for insulin today?"
0,Also need dental and eye coverage for seniors. Why retire and loose two costly benwfits
2,I‚Äôm sick and tired of people being sick and tired. I‚Äôm tired of people needing insulin in the first place. The cost of the drugs isn‚Äôt the problem! The fact that so many need them is the problem. Why are so many Americans sick? That‚Äôs what people need to focus on!
0,"Yes, we need medical for all, apply 2% extra tax for medical below 65."
2,I agree this is a problem. But very few people use insulin in a vial these days. Let's talk about insulin pens and get up to speed. Or perhaps compare the average cost for 1 month's supply of insulin.
0,"Absolutely terrible the way we are charged for drugs. That should be number one for Congress, but hey, they don‚Äôt care about us and they have GREAT medical coverage. Maybe make them have what we do and have to actually pay for it and just maybe there will be a change. Seems like only Bernie is fighting for us. Keep it up Bernie maybe some day we will win."
2,"Paying $12 for life saving medicine should be something everyonr demands, regardless of party. It's ridiculous to let greedy pharmacy companies to have control over life saving meds or any meds for that matter. My wish is to see companies that exploited and caused the of people made to pay restitution. Hey,its better than tarred and feathered...whi
ch would include politicians who support greed companies."
2,"Absolutely. It‚Äôs K Street that‚Äôs responsible for this, and, of course, the politicians they bribe. We should make bribes to politicians illegal."
2,"And for those of us who choose healthy nutritional alternatives, such as juice that has kept my brain tumor from growing for 14 years that I have to pay $153 out of pocket instead of it's being paid for along with my vitamins and supplements which would be paid for in the Canadian system, and hopefully in Medicare for all. Please, please call Congress 202-224-3121 insist they bring medicare-for-al

2,hope it doesnt sound like gloating( im not) but vaccines are free in the uk ( as is all health care)... save the NHS...it wasnt given but hard fought for against the establishment of the time 1948...
2,"We‚Äôve been hearing this problem for years‚Ä¶. No one cares. Congress has so many other things more important to do than these drugs prices‚Ä¶ like fighting over masks, abortion rights, how to take back control of the Congress next year blah blah blah‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs all they care ‚Ä¶ Forget it, we are on our own‚Ä¶"
2,Also insulin is usually free in Canada if you have supplemental insurance.
2,"That's the cost of pharmaceuticals
paying politicians. We are the ones paying for the corruption."
2,Our health care system is probably one of the best examples of how warped the definition of freedom is in the United States.
2,It is my understanding if implemented the proposed changes aimed at seniors won‚Äôt go into effect until 2028.
2,"Until our Congress and that includes every Democrat, Independent, and Republican, man and woman, STOPS taking bribes (monetary donations) from the Pharmaceutical companies in our USA, we will NEVER have the benefit of negotiating the lowest price! It is the same exact reason we will never have Universal Health Care (Medicare For All)! No other Country in our world has paid higher costs for medicine and health care, than the USA!"
2,Drug companies wouldn't have to charge it they didnt have to have stock piles of money for law suits in this country. Ever drug out there a lawyer trying to bv sue them over
2,"Buy a bus pass. Canadian taxes are extremely high, but they get a lot for their money unlike California."
2,As long as the uninsured aren't charged the maximum inflated amount to make up for lost profits.
2,We need to wake up to what's going on. We first need to vote and get out Country back before it's too late. There are way to many distractions. We are so close to becoming a dictatorship. Then we will not have to worry about any of this other stuff. We'll have nothing. We will be lookingüôè for a Country to take us in -as immigrants and see how kind that will be for us.
2,The engine that drives capitalism is competition. When there is a monopoly there is no competition. Russian and American oligarchs gave us rule by monopoly-ist.
2,We should also be talking about how to prevent type 2 diabetes with a proper human diet.
2,"Yup. Having grown up in both, I can say there are some notable and noticeable aberrations in the neighbouring pharmaceutical philosophies."
2,We are all sick of it but Congress is getting paid off too much by big Pharma so nothing will change. Greed needs to stop in Congress FIRST! Can you get that done???
0,"The laws of supply and demand are so easily manipulated to benefit the seller and satisfy the stock holder. ""Nothing personal, it's just business"" a quote from ""The Godfather"" is the mantra of the drug industry. Moral, ethical and fair trade practices are gone the way of the dinosaurs. It's the way of Trumpian economics. I'm left wondering if the corporations can be held culpable of involuntary malicious homicide. Given the drugs the deceased needed are less costly a few miles away in Canada...ü§îüò≤üò°üòî"
2,So lotteries for people with the vaccine. Free testing free vaccines. Huh no free insulin?
0,I thought the solution was to cut the tax of the Novo Nordisk CEO? That‚Äôs what you were moaning about before‚Ä¶
2,"I'm Swedish, but if I had been American I would have fought hard for improving the health care system in the US, the richest country in the world. Sure, many people think of Sweden as a communist hellhole (we're not a communist country, we have a social democratic government, labour party), and we DO pay higher taxes compared to many other countries (but not a 60 % flat rate income tax, a lot of people are convinced we pay that). Anyway, the taxes are spent on health care among other things. Insulin is free, no cost for the patient at all.

Yes, I'm very aware you can't compare the US to Sweden. We're a small country with a different system. But if anyone is going to change the system, it's Bernie. He would be a kick-*ss president.

I'm an outsider looking in, and to me it seems like your system allows the greedy companies to be in control, to do as they please and charge people whatever they want."
2,"Yes, Bernie, who cannot agree? But the shareholders, Bernie, the shareholders! They vote too."
2,"I am sick and tired of hearing you and your ilk using this as a platform, but never actually doing anything about it at all."
2,"Sick of being suckered by the politicians who are paid by big Pharma to keep prices up , we are being scalped by the politicians who are supposed to be protecting us. Vote all the bums out until they stop screwing us."
2,"Yes - this is unacceptable. EVERYONE thinks it's unacceptable - everyone except certain greedy lawmakers. We need to replace representatives
who refuse to do the will of the people."
2,All republicans and three democrats voted against letting Medicare negotiate drug prices. What‚Äôs next?
2,"Cost in Australia if your 60 yrs old or older. Or make less than 39,000 . 5 dollars. For everyone else 12 dollars Australian ."
0,"Go Bernie! That is exactly on point! Keep on it and make it an issue in the upcoming elections. Accountability!
! Thanks for the continued effort."
1,"You know, might as well start a news show, the way you feed us information, but don't seem to be doing anything. If this is the way Democrats deal with being in power.... we got a tough fucking road ahead."
2,Anyone that's been in congress for decades and allowed this to legally happen should be in prison
2,"I bet that vile in Canada costs $100 but since the government pays a subsidy, the patients part is $12."
2,"Why can't Americans just buy the insulin from Canada? Let me guess, because the government says so."
2,"Cost of one vial in Puerto Rico, Lantus $485 dls, Insulin Lispro (humalog) 375 dls. üò¢"
2,"Then do something. Talk, talk, talk. Can‚Äôt rally the troops Bernie?"
2,The solution to this might be to prevent diabetes in people in the first place
2,Who will subsidize the drug companies profits if we won‚Äôt.
0,"Well Bernie, seems like the republicans like for us to pay the higher prices n there is something that you n me can do!!! VOTE for Team Blue!!"
2,You are an angry old man who needs to retire. You bring nothing to our country or it‚Äôs people. Never have.
2,You also need to fix the patent system since Big Pharma routinely game that
2,If government got out of the way the price would naturally come down.

No party has helped it get better and these posts don‚Äôt & won‚Äôt make a difference.

1,democrats so misinformed
2,"What I don't get is how the corporation gets sole ownership of the patent if the American citizens are paying for the research and development of many of these drugs.

First, that sounds 100% like an administrative failure. Drug companies don't just get this research funding out of thin air. They negotiate with the government for them. Exactly like with the Covid vaccines. That deal has been outstanding for the American people. Could you imagine if everyone had to buy our vaccines out of pocket or through insurance? We probably wouldn't have 25% of Americans vaccinated, and they'd be coming from Europe.

I would laugh in the face of a drug co CEO if he came to me with a bullshit deal like what we have been getting. I would feel like he was spitting in my face. I would kick them out of the White House and call his biggest competitor asking if they would like to be the first drug company to release xyz drug? Yeah? Great, but if Americans are paying for the research we get royalties on sales which will go to help fund future medical research, and there will be cap limits on American patients, with lower caps for the elderly and veterans. We would get that drug developed and CEOs would seriously think twice about going to the White House thinking that they are going to scam the American people."

TooFarLeft
Education is a good investment from an individual, family, community or national perspective and tuition free education will reduce the burden from the root on our medical expenses too for example.

Healthcare for all is actually CHEAPER with the insurance industry off of the table along with most of the time lost due to billing among many other reasons.

A universal basic income (UBI) is CHEAPER than all of the thousands of individual federal, state and local social safety net programs including things like Social Security and unemployment insurance, etc with all of their budgets, overhead expenses and inefficiencies eliminating the humiliating need for people to lose time to prove their poverty to qualify for aid.

Internet for all is a great and necessary investment to give everyone the opportunity to study, search for work, work remotely, etc online.

Solar power is CHEAPER and electric vehicles are soon to be CHEAPER to make and already are considerably CHEAPER to maintain and operate, especially if charged from your own solar power.

What do you think will happen to crime rates, peace and equality in general after we launch universal healthcare, a universal basic income, universal education and internet for all, raising the starting point of capitalism from zero, we‚Äôll let you die with no money, to a level of life with dignity, reducing societal daily fears on a massive scale and freeing us to welcome the automation revolution with open arms rather than with fear and great harm? üòÉ EqualityMovemen

Depriving the manufacturers of their intellectual property, investment return, worthwhile risk, and return on costly research. Often times forcing those companies to sell drugs below cost rather than being put out of business. The US couldn‚Äôt care less about protecting innovations and intellectual property abroad so those companies have to make a profit somewhere. That all being said, you are highly full of üí© as usual not sharing free and substantially lower prices that your followers could receive (yes, WITHOUT insurance). I wonder how much innovation in medicine we‚Äôd have if we didn‚Äôt have incentives for companies to make new medical progress. I sure bet a socially managed drug world would stifle the advancement that these companies do and create. Focus on stopping your comrades in other countries and the white house from stealing from innovators and make them all pay their fair share. Why is there never any substance, background or solutions that exist that you can share? Greed my ass. Explain the dynamics and why what happens does. Hint: drug companies need to turn a profit and take on tremendous amounts of risk, failure, and loss. Protect American companies from getting robbed by socialist country extortion artists, defend intellectual property, and the prices will come down. You have such a presence and platform that could be used for good. All you do is fear monger instead of providing existing solutions and support for innovation. Socialist America is its own worst enemy.

How far should rules go? Desert Sun Gannett Article
--- --- ---
I commend the Palm Springs City Council for going further than almost every other city, even the most progressive, in enacting both a vaccine and a mask mandate. Even San Francisco and New York have only mandated one or the other.

The city should now mandate medical grade masks, since cloth masks are virtually useless. In fact, they should unilaterally re-enact Newsom‚Äôs old color coded system, and require strict capacity limitations and masking outdoors. We need at least a 50% capacity restriction, plus a mask mandate, plus a vaccine mandate to control the virus now. And leave more restrictions options on the table if people just won‚Äôt behave.

The fact that some would actually agree with what I just wrote is terrifying.

‚ÄòReasonable people can disagree about when a zygote becomes a ""human life"" - that's a philosophical question. However, regardless of whether or not one believes a fetus is ethically equivalent to an adult, it doesn't obligate a mother to sacrifice her body autonomy for another, innocent or not.

Body autonomy is a critical component of the right to privacy protected by the Constitution, as decided in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), McFall v. Shimp (1978), and of course Roe v. Wade (1973). Consider a scenario where you are a perfect bone marrow match for a child with severe aplastic anemia; no other person on earth is a close enough match to save the child's life, and the child will certainly die without a bone marrow transplant from you. If you decided that you did not want to donate your marrow to save the child, for whatever reason, the state cannot demand the use of any part of your body for something to which you do not consent. It doesn't matter if the procedure required to complete the donation is trivial, or if the rationale for refusing is flimsy and arbitrary, or if the procedure is the only hope the child has to survive, or if the child is a genius or a saint or anything else - the decision to donate must be voluntary to be constitutional.
This right is even extended to a person's body after they die; if they did not voluntarily commit to donate their organs while alive, their organs cannot be harvested after death, regardless of how useless those organs are to the deceased or many lives they would save. That's the law.

Use of a woman's uterus to save a life is no different from use of her bone marrow to save a life - it must be offered voluntarily. By all means, profess your belief that providing one's uterus to save the child is morally just, and refusing is morally wrong. That is a defensible philosophical position, regardless of who agrees and who disagrees. But legally, it must be the woman's choice to carry out the pregnancy. She may choose to carry the baby to term. She may choose not to. Either decision could be made for all the right reasons, all the wrong reasons, or anything in between. But it must be her choice, and protecting the right of body autonomy means the law is on her side. Supporting that precedent is what being pro-choice means.‚Äô‚Äù ~ from a friend"

0,"Republicans and the former guy are only interested in lining their own pockets. They don‚Äôt care about the Country, the citizens (Repub. OR Dems), the economy, the environment, the debt, the Constitution, the Republic, the flag, or any of the rallying points. They care about themselves only."
2,"How do you people, either Democrat or Republican, sleep at night knowing one day you will stand before a Higher Power by taking money to support a classy way of life, when there‚Äôs people who needs help???"
2,"Because they are all multimillionair
es and they WILL NOT pass anything that will take $$$ from them."
2,We have GOT to reform and enforce campaign financing laws. Our elected officials do not work for us; they work for the highest bidder and it is destroying the social stability and economic viability of the American Dream. They have literally rolled us back to the Gilded Age of robber barons.
2,We need to get money out of politics. It is a seriously corrupting influence. Our elected officials spend more time begging for money to finance their election campaigns than they do actually working for us.
1,Let Gavin pay for it. He and the democrats have mismanaged the forest for years. They NEED to burn occasionally.

0,"The closer to ""conservative"" politicians get, the easier they are to buy. Actually, all politicians spend way too much time ""fund raising"". We should really have publicly funded races, and laws that (when elected) politicians can't own stock, accept donations from anything other than individuals, and regulate lobbying. Government is supposed to work for the people, not the super rich and not for big corporations."
1,So why did Gov. Newsom divert money intended for Forrest management for something else? And why hasn't he addressed the water needs of the state? He doesn't know how to prepare ahead of time for these crisis.
2,This is why Insulinis $300 a pan in the United States. And $125 a pound overseas. Isn‚Äôt that awful patriotic of them . They said they sell it for a competitive price
2,"Both parties get paid by the same people. The reason most people vote for Democrats is that they are not Republicans. The reason most other people vote for Republicans is that they are not Democrats. The working class can not be allowed to win. That's why weren't allowed the opportunity to vote for Bernie Sanders and when we did, it was ignored. We are all left voting for the party we hate the least. You won't find the tools to gain your freedom in the master's house."

1,"No one FORCES an ABORTION...but YOU want to FORCE a vaccine? My body, MY CHOICE...or isn't it!! Sit Down!!"
2,Probably because they would have to pay more in taxes.
2,"They make so when a lobbyist comes along offering them millions in perks, it's hard to say no. Our government has a pay structure well-suited to the 1970's, but now it's simply too far behind the scale of what these folks could make in the private sector. A lot of people think we pay our elected officials too much, but the problem is that we don't pay them enough to not take lobbyist money."
0,You're what I'd call a closet Republican.
2,Codify this law now!
0,"I read today the deficit was 7.8 trillion. When are the Democrats going to realize the Republicans are playing them. There is no intention of the republicans agreeing to anything for the present, they are looking at the future. You can see that in what Trump is doing by supporting all these people in state positions dealing with elections, if the the elections in the future is very close. Your dealing with some very nasty, corrupt individuals, that will stop at nothing, to cheat to win. An example is the last Supreme Court judge that shows how evil they are. Again they have cheated in the past when they didn't have the votes and changed it to 50 votes to win. You never trust Moscow Mitch McConnell and you should know that by now. You want to do something positive, start getting the people in the Republican Party with all the criminal activity they have done in the last plus decade. Get them removed from office and put in prison if possible. There supporters don't care how corrupt Trump and the Republicans are. The more corrupt they are the better they like it. You saw who supports them and the type of people they are. It's going to be interesting how hard the punishment will be for the people that were arrested for the insurrection, who was involved in the planning, and weapons that were used to murder the people that lost their life and the type of injuries that caused their wounds. The intent was to do bodily harm to anyone in their way of the attack."
2,"What happened to the billions we voted for and approved for new and expanded water storage??? Yeah,,,, didn't happen, did it!?"

0,In my opinion these people aren‚Äôt Dems‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre wolves in sheep‚Äôs clothing. I‚Äôve said for years that that‚Äôs how they will infiltrate the party and then work to dismantle from the inside. They‚Äôre no more trustworthy than the Russians or the Chinese. They know full well that they can‚Äôt win the public vote fair and square and cheating is their go to method now.
2,"So if they already took the bribes, does that mean they‚Äôre locked in and have to vote against the common good? Their constituents need to bombard them with messages to move them to do the right thing, or else."
2,If the debt ceiling needs to be explained to you every year Senator you should resign. because you obviously need to rest at home.

0,"They are afraid of the GOP and the American News Networks. They are virtually anti-society, anti-Social Democrat anti-people."
