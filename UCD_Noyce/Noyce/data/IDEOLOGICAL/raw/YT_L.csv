0,They don't deserve  a President like President Bidon. They deserve a coward  who can brainwash them.
0,"Jihad defends trump,death in the republicans"
2,It was a disgrace seeing our so called fellow Americans act like that on our Capital!!
2,"The government PAID for this? What I mean is 1+1= priceless.... the life insurance, mortgage, student loans, car titles all in rogue languages now but rainfall grows green money? Mirror images üò∂üòí"
2,"They so should have opened up with machine guns, they needed to wipe out everyone of these sick, seditious fools."
1,Trivial  in relations to the BLM-ANTIFA  summer of Nation Wide Insurrection
1,"Afghanistan: Biden abandoned Americans and our helpers to their fate at the hands of the Taliban. Get people out before drawing down our troops?---nah. Give allies Britain, France, & Germany some advance-notice that we will be abruptly abandoning them too?---Nah.

INCOMPETENCE on a breathtaking scale. Perhaps our worst foreign policy debacle ever. And to further exhibit his senility, Biden now excitedly CONGRATULATES himself about Afghanistan---how's THAT for irony? üôÑüòÅ"
2,"Ah, so, when will this misinformation be taken down? The FBI has already made a ruling on this."
2,"Also, MSNBC can freely show the video of the gun being fired and killing someone, and YT doesnt take it down, while if anyone else who isnt a large news network showed such a clip, it gets removed for violating YT's guidelines.

I can only assume that this is because A) they are MSNBC, thus they are held to different standards and rules, and B) YT actually agrees with the political message and tone, thus they allow MSNBC's coverage to run unchecked.

And this is why people hate you and want to cause violence."
2,"I love the completely "" _unbiased take_ "" of MSNBC.
This is absolute gold anyway, I wish they had succeeded. You know, buildings can actually be burned and be brought into the ground, just saying...."
1,"So bad that people were stuck inside their homes that were set on fire by people? So bad that business buildings burned? So bad that historic statues were damaged? Buildings, cars and more were vandalized? People by themselves were beaten in the streets? Nah. At least on Jan 6, the people peacefully appeared, to the location of the source of our problems. I do not support violence, vandalism or any of that, but It was Antifa and BLM that screwed it up again in this case. Made it look bad for the innocent. Not regular ordinary citizens defending their rights. Enough of Jan 6, Solve 2020 Riots first!
United We Stand, Divided We Fall! This Government has done an excellent job dividing people for their own selfish goals!"
1,"üá∫üá∏AMERICA AND FELLOW PATRIOTSüá∫üá∏ Stand for those who protect our constitution and our freedom! Too many have lost their lives defending us from foreign enemies and communist/ socialist agendas. We will never allow American soldiers to die in vein. This is the USAs future, the future our kids and grand kids. Heros have died for our constitution and our freedom,  NOW IT IS UP TO US TO MAINTAIN THAT FREEDOM! Dig up strength from deep within yourselves. These radical leftists and anti Americans (who have fallen victim to the media) will never get the best of us or our country. If anyone doesn't like it here then they can move out of the USA. PERIOD. As we already know history repeats itself.  We have already won this same war many times over. Now we just gotta do it again. Have faith and stay strong! üá∫üá∏"

0,"Be honest. Had this been a black lives matter protest, there would have been hundreds dead. Discrimination. Starting to see things differently since I married an ethnic girl."
0,Trump needs to go to prison for everything he has done. He keeps getting away with things that anybody else would be charged.  He is not a nice person on so many levels. I watched the video of more footage of the riot and I'm still in shock with what I saw. This riot was way worse than I thought
2,FBI says different.
0,Every Republican in office sould have to sit and watch the Capitol attack on large screen with high volume.  Lets see them talk about it being like a tourist visit then.
2,"In this age of LED lighting, why modern media companies still use gaslighting is a total mystery."
1,You want to see insurrection  look at Afghanistan! That is insurrection  idiots!
2,"On the heels of FBI announcing this was NOT an insurrection & that there was no central or organized plan to 'attack' the capital (without firearms or any weapons for that matter), this didn't age well. üòÜ

Maybe it was the prayer meeting they held on the Senate floor that has their panties on a bunch. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

2,FBI reports scant evidence of any coordinated plot on January 6.
2,"Cops should've shot more of them, like all of them."
2,Hitler's Fascist Government has taken over. We are headed for Orson Wells 1984 book. ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING. WELCOME TO FASCISM. WORSE THAN A DICTATORSHIP. READ THE BOOK. RESEARCH ELEMENTS OF FASCISM TO OPEN YOUR EYES AND SEE THE TRUTH.
2,"I can't stand all this bickering. It breaks my ‚ù§üíî. Politicians and Donors love this. We are distracted by hate, division and rage towards each other. üëøüò£
       Then they can pass all their Fascist Laws. Pay attention to new policies. We have been stripped of all our freedom."
1,Americans need to remember that these news agencies love to claim things that did not happen to make the rioters look even worse. Especially MSNBC. This guy here should be ashamed of himself for not staying neutral and clearly siding against Trump. In other words its biz as usual for them.  Just rem they LOVE to add this and that to try and drive home their thoughts so to speak. Pathetic

1,It is time to impeach Biden for causing the killings of Americans around the world. Americans are being killed by the cartels coming into our country with tons of drugs and creating crime nation wide. He is not competent to hold the office. He did not win the election. He has caused more destruction to our country faster than any President  that has ever served. We must remove him asap to give our country a fighting chance to save our country. Please contact  our goverment and let your voice be heard. The phone numbers you can call at the capitol to let your voice be heard is 202-224-3121   202-225-3121. These numbers will connect you with capitol switch board where you can ask to speak with the office of your state politicians. Please get Biden out now before we all pay dearly.
2,I wonder why they won't put individual one in jail are they afraid of him for some reason or is there some other reasons hint hint
0,They should all have been shot. That would send a clear message to these Trump supporters and trump and the enablers.

2,"This country is destined for failure.  When such a large group of people attempt to overthrow the government, it won't be long before they succeed.  Democracy will be eliminated and be replaced by tryrany.   If not that, the hordes of people from countries that we have been invading for many years will descend upon us and take over just as happened in Rome.

They won't listen to blacks of any stripe; they won't listen to Hispanics. They won't listen to women, or Libs, or Progressives, or children, or ANYONE who insists that the idea of God has to pass even the most feeble standards of discussion, or science, or even education. And why do they hyperventilate so? Because THEIR idea of what God is, can't pass even those abbreviated tests.

ROTpublicans proudly stand for ALL the rest of us, those groups I detailed above, just pulling in our unruly noses, and letting them ride roughshod over us and our priorities.

And since ROTpublicans HAVE NO MORALS to speak of, they are not willing to just go home when they DON'T HAVE THE MAJORITY. No, they've got to then STEAL the votes, by screwing up the entire voting system... and KEEPING it screwed up in a ROTpublican direction.

Our task now is to stop that from happening. Period."

Already there is a great problem with Republican's blatantly, shamelessly lying  and denying, plus refusing  to acknowledge the damage they have done, all to please Donald J. Trump. Please don't use endearing words to describe any of them until we know the depth of their involvement . They are a terrorist gang now, with crimes against America too numerous to mention. Many right-wing politicians became traitors on the day insurrectionists impersonated patriots as they violated America. And now for some bizarro reason-they defy helping America end the pandemic. They are willing to even put their own children's lives at stake to ""own the libs""  they say. That's not even the American thing to do.

1,"A key aspect to a happy world is harmony. Harmony consists everybody. Harmony is influential. Happiness is influential. Those two things don't exist in the overall human race because of a lot of set backs. One key thing that divides the human race is the difference in ethics. Good ethics or morals are principles that contribute to Good conduct and good conduct is a positive influence that contribute to harmony. Good ethics should be universal around the earth just like a smile generally means happiness around earth.

Here's the thing. Besides all the crime and misery that contribute to this sick world that has it's negative influence, you also have loose morals (let's say loose conduct for better understanding) and loose conduct has it's negative influence. Example, parents that regularly curse around their kids might influence their kids even if they tell them not to do it. Homosexuality, is, loose, conduct. It has it's influence as you can clearly see around you in today's world. It, contributes, negatively, to, humanity. How?

Homosexuality challenges the importance of ethics, logic and reasoning. Three common things you need for wisdom and Three common things that are challenged in committing crimes like murder, domestic violence, rape etc.. When you challenge those things in regards to the ethics of sexuality, it attacks the meaning of ethics in general and attacks the human cognition like, 'if I could do this I could do even more' which could lead to recklessness. It also attacks the meaning on quality of life, like how a person experiences life. Influence effects your motivations and your mental and physical wellbeing, and it's contagious because it effects you and everyone else.

So how is homosexuality truly beneficial to those doing it and to humanity? The world is like a family household, if one thing is out of place, everything is. So we all have a part on contributing to earth and humanity, it's best to be in harmony not disarray. But this world won't be in harmony with loose conduct, that's one key reason why the world is the way it is today.

NO ONE is born Gay. There is no scientific proof that people are born Gay. There is ZERO proof. ZERO! There is not a ""Gay Gene."" This is a fairy tale. People believe deceptive lies.

A choice to live for themselves and their selfishness or to live for God. ""Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve."" [Josh.24:15]. People are born with a CHOICE!

You are now facing the strongest opponent to American freedom that America has ever known and the odds of survival seem long. ¬†How did we succeed in the past against tyranny, oppression and assault?¬†

Some might say that we sent our former family members into battle with the best technology and resources available and they would be partly right. ¬†But our true strength has always resided in our steadfast faith in God. ¬†Our belief that our cause was just and that it was by God‚Äôs hand that we would prevail. ¬†

Let us renew that trust and faith and accept the promise of help in dark times. ¬† Let us unleash the greatest power in creation and call upon our creator to help us in the shadow of what seems to be the death of our Republic. ¬†One nation under God and in God we trust is the cornerstone of this nation.¬†

And so on Wednesday, July 8th let all God loving members of the American family and across the globe unite in prayer that first begins by acknowledging that without Jesus Christ we can do nothing and with Jesus Christ all things are possible for His glory. That in our own words we ask for guidance and direction to do our part in restoring the founding principals of this nation. ¬†And if inclined to do so, share those prayers with others by posting on YouTube. ¬† (Please share this message)"

Honestly, whatever cult you subscribe to, your god or cow, whichever you prefer, can go fuck itself. The book you abide by is nothing more than primitive scare tactics. How pathetic that in the era of information we're still falling pray to poorly written, out-dated, evidence lacking, illliterature. This is why the U.S. gets so much flak, because we're a broken nation and the root of it is religion i.e, lack of reason, sheer stubbornness. Put down the gosh darn books and put your morality on the front line and ask yourselves aside from your ignorant ideologies, why you feel entitled to spout your bullshit on the gay and lesbian community as if it holds any weight? You people are too far gone for even Asclepius to heal... I feel as stupid as those I speak of for even entertaining their asinine beliefs. Hail to equality and may the U.S. continue to break down these barriers."

Let me check my memory and I see there was another government entity in the last millennium ¬†that was also UN-ELECTED and served for their entire life, that‚Äôs right, a KING. History tells us what our founding fathers thought of such a government entity when they gave King George V a big ‚ÄúF ¬†you‚Äù when they signed the Declaration of Independence. Today we have ¬†a Supreme Court that is governing just like a king, using judicial decrees to make law, a form of judicial activism that has no legitimate place in the highest court of the land. If the Supreme Court wants to become a political entity of our three branches of government, of which in my opinion they have firmly established with their recent rulings, then they should be subject to the same process as the other two branches, the legislative and executive, and that is an ELECTION. No longer should Supreme Court justices be nominated by the president and then approved by the senate. These justices should be elected by the people through a national election, like any other political entity in a DEMOCRACY."

Jesus said sexual immorality, which includes Homosexuality, make a person ""unclean, defiled and polluted!"" God's Word says, ""Keep the marriage bed undefiled, uncontaminated, unsoiled, for God will judge the sexual immoral."" [Heb.13:4].

Looked up this guy. He is currently a fugitive from justice because it tried to interfere with a trial in Washington state by acting as the defendents attorney despite not having a law license.  He and his wife have fled to Mexico where our ambassador says he is behaving like a spoiled brat because he picks and chooses what laws of theirs he will obey. He insists their cops speak to him in English, he won't observe their Covid19 rules because he doesn't believe in Covid19. Oh yeah he believes in conspiracy theories and is a Libertarian."

I also said, ""You are the worst driver i've ever seen."" He let me go and as far as i could see he drove more carefully after that."
0,This was a great video. I like how this gentleman questioned the officer with a very strong knowledge of the use of unmarked vehicles. This is actually how a actual cop should approach a vehicle. They should walk up and say ‚Äúdo you know why I pulled you over‚Äù without drawn gun. Then they explain why. This doesn‚Äôt happen in the videos I have seen with violence. The cops assume you are a criminal and don‚Äôt tell the person what they have or may have done. It‚Äôs your a criminal and I am judging you.

I know adulting is hard, but if you want freedom, you have to learn to be responsible....jeez"
2,So young girls in bikinis üëô üëô at the beach triggered your porn addiction. So to satisfy your self-serving perversion you approached these young women under the guise of Christ. Then because your fiance had on that wack a$$ Wonder Woman outfit you're mad? Allegedly! The only difference between them and his fiance is her bottoms. But she is showing her skins none the less.

2,"I'd have told him that God created Adam and Eve naked and the beach provides us with an opportunity to get closer to our original state in Paradise. This guys previous job in his previous life was handing out fig leaf's in the Garden of Eden. I'd have called up a photo on my phone of Michaelangelo's Sistine Chapel frescoes as soon as he invoked the name of God. For devout Michaelangelo, the purest expression of divinity is found in the perfection of the naked human form. Unfortunately, the leaders of the Catholic Church were even more uptight about nudity than this guy: they commissioned other artists to paint clothes over the original figures nudity."
2,"When I was a kid some gigantically fat, gross woman told me I had to leave a public pool because I was upsetting young children because of my leg (I am an amputee). She even put her hands on me to physically force me to leave the pool area, at which point the life guards (and letter the police) got involved. 
     Never mind that I had every right to use the pool and had paid to be there.
     Also, I have been an amputee for 48 years now (since I was 3) and yea, little kids are sometimes scared, but mostly they are curious. If I can talk to them (always with parents permission) they stop being scared right away.
     When I worked at a resort I was swimming laps on my day off when I saw a little girl, about 4 with my fake leg trying to give it to her terrified looking dad.
    The kid was German and was trying to tell her dad, ""Daddy, someone for got their leg. You need to find them and give it back before they fall over.""
    Dad was thinking, ""Oh god, my kid has found someone's prosthetic leg and is playing with it. What should I say if the owner sees this?""
    Well his nightmare had come true. The owner had seen it, but thought it was hella funny.
    Though the child spoke only German, and I spoke only English the father, once he realized I was not upset was happy to translate.
     I was able to tell the child about my leg through her father. The kid was extremely sweet. After I explained about my leg and got her to put it back, she said something and patted my head (I was in the pool at this point) that caused her dad to laugh. She had said, ""You poor man. Not only is your leg gone, you can't even talk.""
     I have a huge amount of experience with children. It doesn't hurt them to see disabled people."
2,I spoke to fast...I WAS RIGHT ABOUT HIM and why he had a issue with these women. lol

2,So glad these girls were atheists. Smart

But each one dropped their stone & walked away. I would like to see if other women down the beach, were dressed the same way as the girls, and if he reacted to same way to them."
1,he was not saying all for ivermectin   he was talking about his entire treatment  it got him better     TYT  spreads misinformation by saying Trump was working with putin for four years
1,The vaccine doesn‚Äôt work you can catch it and past it.. let this shit run its course.
1,"he never claimed that ivermectin is the ONLY thing that cured him......   the bottom line is, it wasn't the vaccine that cured him, obviously.......   TYT and CNN accusing someone from spreading misinformation is the MOUNT EVEREST of irony :D:D:D"
2,Segura in the interview tells joe that  he got the vaccine because his cousin who is infectious diseases expert admitted to him is the best choice then rogan does a stink face.
2,he would sue tyt but they have no money.
2,He was talking about suing CNN because they were saying he was taking the drug used on horse's not the one prescripted to humans.
2,"Dr Andrew Hill's post may have been referring to a ""study"" published by the Front Line Medical Care Alliance. Earlier this week, a judge prevented Dr Wagshul, the guy who runs that shit-show, from prescribing Ivermectin to a Covid patient."

Education on this is important, otherwise grifters will continue to grift those who are gullible"
0,"To answer why people will pay for medicine that isn't proven to work instead of taking the vaccine for free is because there is a saying.  ""A fool and their money will soon part"""
1,I'm unsubscribing from tyt due to finally seeing that they will spew left wing talking points blinding .. do your own research about ivermectin.. just to add I'm all for democratic progression
2,I used being vaccinated. That and garlic. Hmm... it looks like I am fine without Ivermectin. Joe Rogan is just some punk who got lucky and survived. Wait until next strain. We will see if he survives that round.
1,Ana is better then Joe. Much better. Joe is garbage.
2,why don't everybody have access to monoclonal antibodies? What's the reason? Are there people who are more important than others?
2,Joe Rogan living proof that comedians are not philosophers and you don't have to be smart to be funny
2,I have watched this pandemic since in began and doctors have said how it tricks people because they naturally get better for a couple of days and then they go down hill fast.......Has Rogan been 'well' for sometime now or only a couple of days?
2,"Please Ana, by all means go talk to him on his show line Cenk did. Engage in a healthy disagreement that may educate how both sides think about it. You debated Tomi Lahren. Why not just be a guest? Not a bad idea for some attention to both points of view."
2,"I listened to a couple episodes of Joe Rogan's podcast a couple months ago while at work. Wanted to see what all the hype around this guy was. I really only knew him from the sitcom ""Newsradio"" and ""Fear Factor"", time killers on NBC back in the day. So I listened, and his interviews where serviceable, and he had no great insight into anything with his commentary. Like most of his show was pleasant enough background, but the level his listeners think he's so smart and the $100 million dollar is baffling. Like he wasn't even a good entertainer really. Like Rush Limbaugh was a horrible man, but his show could be entertaining, and he was a brilliant broadcaster, if not a great commentator who would often say horrific things. However he could stretch nothing into hours of content. Rogan doesn't even have that going for him. So, basically, I don't get this guy at all. However, on a larger scale, he has gotten dangerous and Spotify needs to pull his contract."
1,Joe is endlessly disappointing and really chosen to go down the path of the rightwing grifter in order to make even more money than he already has...
2,Was he vaccinated
2,"Either way he got better WITHOUT THE VACCINE !!!............And weren't they telling people that antibiotics just don't work at all in the beginning ??? So, there's no need in even thinking about taking'em.... They were suppressing and bad mouthing  just about everything(even vitamins ) last year that was Not a wearing a mask or waiting for vaccine ...."
2,You guys all thought that Joe would die and were rooting for it because it would fit your narrative of ‚Äúvaccines for everyone‚Äù. You were wrong. Vaccines are only for those with comorbidities. He got over this virus in ONE day with no vaccine. Lol.
2,Rogan is such an impressionable baby. At this point it seems malicious or it's because he is self-selecting the only doctors who agree with this Ivermectin BS. Data is out there. Read it or shut up
1,"Look up, ""EXPOSED! FDA, CDC WHO is hiding this from you."""
0,"Joe Rogan has got many deaths on his hands. What's he going to do now, sue for ""defamation""? :-)"
2,"His doctor advised him to take it you nimwats, crazy how TYT's content is aligned with CNN's, MSNBC etc, watch the video his doctor advised him, it helped him. he never told people to take it"
2,"I think the other point is, he is constantly claiming that people like him with no comorbidities  and are healthy are fine. 

So why does he need intervention?  It‚Äôs just a cold isn‚Äôt it? 

He accidentally shown that deep, deep down, he doesn‚Äôt believe it."
2,"I mean people can try to use  Ivermectin for covid. And if it doesn't work, they can curse joe rogan on their deathbed lol"
2,Guess ana and cenk won't be on his show anytime soon
2,"Z pac, the antibiotic, will do absolutely nothing against a virus. 
REAL doctor‚Äôs are actually strongly against prescribing antibiotics for anything other than a bacterial infection, because it can cause antibiotic resistance when used when it‚Äôs not needed. 
Yeah, way to go Joe, treat a viral infection with an antibiotic. 
Idiot. üòµ‚Äçüí´"
1,tYt is the most stupid online political content creator rip tyt
0,If there is a virus in the future that is a 100% death rate we are screwed even with a vaccine because people will still be stupid.
1,"Simple !!!! They don't trust the government or TYT, CNN & all the usual propaganda suspects. Maybe because they have all lied about so much all ready !!!"
2,"I have been calling out Kulinski and Talking Points for not calling out ""their boy"". I just saw Saagar back the fool up! ""F**k MSM!""? If they won't call Rogan out, who will?! ""Duh, Duh, it was a duh"". I used to give Kulinski some creditability but the ""synergy"" between him and Talking 'Pints' idiocy has me wondering."
2,"The real problem with Ivermectin is that it only cost about 2 cents a pill‚Ä¶
along with vitamin D (study after study has shown the lower your vitamin D status the harder this virus hits you) there is simply no money to be made.
Shame on you TYT for not doing your job as journalists and buying into the world of big pharma
the WHO says Ivermectin is one of the safest drugs on the planet and could easily be given out to people waiting for a vaccine‚Ä¶the problem is tho if you give people cheap drugs and they get the virus and don't get that sick, they might feel like they don‚Äôt need the vaccine‚Ä¶only money to lose if you promote something cheap, even if it ‚Äúhelps‚Äù
You say that there are no studies‚Ä¶let me ask you this, if you were sick how ethical would it be to withhold a medication that might save your life? Would you participate in such a study?

"
2,"WHERE WILL YOU GO WHEN YOU DIE? 

What day will it happen? Today? Tomorrow? 

One hundred and fifty thousand people die every day. How many of them were ready?

When you stand before God on that day will you go to heaven or hell? 

Jesus Christ tells us that unless you‚Äôre born again you will not see the kingdom of God. You will be judged for your sins; all of the lies, the immoral thoughts, stealing, blaspheming and justly sentenced to hell.

But you don‚Äôt have to go to hell. Jesus Christ tells us that whosoever repents of their sins and trusts in him can be saved. Jesus paid the penalty of your sins on the cross at Calvary two thousands years ago. 

What sin is worth an eternity in hell? Think how precious your eyes are to you, what would it take to sell your eyes? And how much for valuable the soul that looks out of those eyes? Don‚Äôt go to hell, repent and trust in Jesus and be saved."

Seems Mr anti-media propaganda, is himself a propagandist. F**k Joe Rogan."
2,Why do people not listen to scientists and consensus? Does Joe even bring reputable doctors on his show anymore?
0,"Know what‚Äôs super ironic? The same people who refuse the vaccine because they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in it or understand how it works are scared of the side effects are the same people who gladly seek out and take ivermectin without any clue how it works, what is in it, or what the side effects and possible risks are ü§£ AND they‚Äôll cite the study that has since been retracted due to medical fraud as the holy grail of reasons to take ivermectin, yet purposely ignore alllllllll the actual legitimate data proving the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Takes a special kind of stupid. And the sad (and scary!) part is our world is full of em‚Ä¶"
0,"Have we been watching the same Joe Rogan? I have no idea how anyone could have ever thought that he had more than perhaps an eighth of a brain. He has never asked an intelligent question on his show. He just asks his stupid questions in an engaging way, and makes it painfully obvious that he doesn't understand why his controversial guests are controversial. Then his smart guests are just good at taking his stupid questions and giving interesting responses, anyway. He has ALWAYS been the Donald Trump of interviews. He just leverages his confidence and name recognition to convince unknowledgeable people that he is competent and get them to follow him through a kind of unfounded hero worship."
2,"For all of you who wished a person like Rogan and Trump a speedy recovery, I sure hope you‚Äôre all happy. üòêü§®"
2,"I don‚Äôt know ,  should I believe Anna or doctor Pierre Kory (a well known critical care physician ) who with his team treated  hundreds or even thousands covid patients using ivermectin and other medications ."
2,Joe Rogan is a moron. It‚Äôs scary how many followers he has when the guy can barely have a coherent thought. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2,"It's not intelligence thats in play here. First, JR has always been into anti gov conspiracy, and second It's about the attention grabbing. He has became another ""professional idiot"" making whatever statements that will bring in the $. His show should come with disclaimer."
2,Joe Rogan suppose expert saw a way to make money on covid so he decided to go that way and Rogan talk about big pharma reasons. He got lied to and he does not even know it.
2,Take care TYT !! Jo is suing CNN & only right. TYT next !!!
2,I'm sure it was the horse meds and not all the other shit he took that was actually proper meds for covid. lol
2,I would of been a little more on board with the ivermectin claim until he mentioned the doctor who prescribed it. I forget the name of the group the doctor is part of I think it's Frontline c19 doctors or some crap but the get major kick backs. Doctors can be bad people too.
2,If you listened to his podcast you might have heard him say he already had his medical treatment in place if he caught covid. That wasn't panicking. As for the vaccine it is not a cure all. Evidence now points to it offsetting the worst effects of covid but you will need a booster 6 months after your second vaccination given it is now proven that it's efficacy drops to 40% after that initial period
2,Lol why you piss off at him for his own opinion. His body his choice . Not like your beloved vaccine does anything to treat the virus. In fact the virus is not even deadly enough to spend this much effort to deal with.
0,"no worries, let him continue to spead the mis-information and more anti-maskers and anti-vaccine retards die, these retards are just wasting earth's resources, their deaths is the only good they will ever contribute to society."
2,I'm no fan of this abortion law. But this is concerning that parts of the country are officially deciding to effectively put sanctions on other parts of the US. I barely even like it when we sanction foreign countries ffs.

2,Pretty sure Texans don‚Äôt care one iota about Portland or their politics...
2,Even though Texas ranks is the number ninth it slowly catching up to California because California is starting to feel the pinch of the pandemic since California lives off of borrowed money it's not really going to last long for the state which is why so many Californians left California for Texas. I don't like this reference but they called Texas the Western version of China in the US. I doubt the state would even notice Portland at all.
1,This is 100% political theatre.  Ted Wheeler is universally hated by progressives in Portland and he knows it.
2,I have been married in two states. Texas and Indiana. On both my marriage applications there is a question that ass are you at least second cousins? That is an actual question on the application. When I asked about it I was told it‚Äôs a old law that you have to be at least second cousins to be married in Texas. I seen the same question on my Indiana marriage license application.

Jesus Christ tells us that unless you‚Äôre born again you will not see the kingdom of God. You will be judged for your sins; all of the lies, the immoral thoughts, stealing, blaspheming and justly sentenced to hell.

But you don‚Äôt have to go to hell. Jesus Christ tells us that whosoever repents of their sins and trusts in him can be saved. Jesus paid the penalty of your sins on the cross at Calvary two thousands years ago. 

What sin is worth an eternity in hell? Think how precious your eyes are to you, what would it take to sell your eyes? And how much for valuable the soul that looks out of those eyes? Don‚Äôt go to hell, repent and trust in Jesus and be saved."

Where ever their reasons are people like Larry Elder prove you don't have to be White to be a White Supremacist. You just have to agree with their fascist ideologies and policies if that means you'll rake in millions of dollars in serving and submitting to the White Elites and White Supremacists of this country who have systematically and purposefully oppressed people of color since the Spanish and the Puritans first landing on this continent.
2,Elder is right but the way he puts it is wrong. But stating that he says slave owners DESERVE reparation's is not what he said. Both sides are going way too far in battling each other when divided we fall.

2,"So this is what I worry about‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve followed TYT for years, but recently they made a very convenient edit to videos from Jimmy Dore, regarding alleged sexual harassment towards Ana Kasparian. As I stated before, I‚Äôm not a fan of jimmy Dore at all, but his comments were about Kasparian being unprofessional with her work attire, and framing it as a joke. What he said was, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a nice ‚Äúnews‚Äù skirt‚Äù‚Äî  They played a clip of Dore saying, (this is not verbatim) ‚Äúi made her feel terrible, and ashamed‚Ä¶ I did that‚Äù ‚Äî then the clip stops and Cenk calls him a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù. Right after the clip cuts off, Dore finishes his comment by explaining how terrible it was that he made her feel that way, and then he apologized. 
‚Äî‚Äî with that said, I‚Äôm voting for Newsom, don‚Äôt like Elder, but I‚Äôm very curious about what he said after the clip stopped, because it was very abrupt. Elder doesn‚Äôt seem like he is advocating for paying slave owners reparations. The point he seems to be making is that it was legal to have slaves, so if reparations were paid out, an argument could be made for the slave owners receiving reparations as well. He didn‚Äôt sound like he was advocating for that, but just making a point on reparations as a whole. If I were to make a guess, he was making an argument against reparations, not making a point that slave owners should be paid as well."
0,A new low for Elder. Saying this to attract white votes is his style.  And there is Owens his female twin. Cali elect him and lookout. Whites want him to do the dirty work. Which he will gladly do. This all started with his hatred of his father. His own father.

1,"Yes, Reparations. Taking money from people who never owned slaves and giving it to people who never were slaves. 
What about white americans from the north whose ancestor probably died fighting to free the slaves? Or black people today whose ancestor's owned slaves? Or what about mixed racial people - would a black person with a white slave owner ancestor have to pay? What about a white person with a black slave ancestor, would they receive money? 
The rabbit hole of reparations makes no sense and is widely open for abuse and perpetuating resentment that should have died decades ago. That's Elders point. You're either too stupid to understand that or are deliberately misrepresenting him so you can smear him."

1,"The young turks are missing Mr. elders point all together. Intentionally. Mr. Elder is pointing out the absurdities one encounters when going down the rabbit hole of reparations.

Elder opened my eyes on the matter. Made me contemplate some important questions and consider things I had not considered. 

Would Rachel dolezal get reparations? Would Oprah Winfrey? Obama? Kamala Harris? When today there are FAR more poverty stricken white people in America than any other people. Do all black people get reparations even though many NEVER had relatives who were enslaved? What about those black people whose families were actually slave OWNERS? There were many. Who pays these reparations? All white people? All citizens whether they had anything to do with the slave trade or not? Republican families who sacrificed their own flesh and blood to liberate the slaves and end the infamous traffic? People whose families never even lived in the country until maybe 100 years after the infamous traffic of slavery had ended? They owe, too? The South was home to 250,000 free blacks. Do their descendants get reparations, too? There were ~4000 black slave owners owning more than 20,000 slaves. How does that figure into ‚ÄúReparations‚Äù?¬†Since the country‚Äôs founding 306,000 slaves were brought here, but since slavery ended more than 2,000,000 black Africans have come here by choice... another 1,000,000 Black Americans came here by choice and by way of the Caribbean. how does THAT figure into reparations?

Because of Larry elder it now seems to me that the only proper way to handle the inequities of the past is to make sure that our laws are just TODAY. That they‚Äôre applied equally to every citizen. To continue to provide access to opportunity WITHOUT favoring or handicapping ANY racial group.¬†I think that‚Äôs the best we‚Äôve got."

1,"A conversation about the optics of this,  I think is wrong. The Taliban maybe bad but there is nothing in this clip which is I haven't seen on or advocated on US TV.

If like me they have been watching US TV over the last few years they would believe it'll be foolish not to have a gun on them at any point"

2,"CENK! I admire you but the way you silenced Ana here was prettier horrendous. This was after all a section introduced and presented by her about the Taliban literally holding new media hostage in Afghanistan. You decided to steal the segment by turning it into an attack on your American media rivals. When Ana tried to respond to this you cut her off repeatedly and then said ""hold on"" which suggests you will allow her to respond at the end. But once you made your point you ended the section without allowing her any retort. 
The Taliban taking total control of the media is an important story but you dismissed it and silenced Ana voice by wagging your finger at her and then holding your hand up to silence her in a very dictatorial fashion. 
This came off terribly. I'm not saying this as some sort of fan of Ana, I actually think she too often doesn't do her due diligence before reporting on a story and it clearly shows but as a boss I would never raise my voice to literally drown out the voice of a female staff member while wagging my finger at her and then use the ""stop!"" hand gesture to silence them.

2,"Great police chief,  he 100% right."
2,A wise man. We all need 2 come together... We have become a divided nation!!!üò¢
2,"This man is one of the reasons I respect people who serve our country with honor and respect. I‚Äôm not just talking about people who wear the uniforms eitherüòí. Chief Acevedo made a good point where our problems lie. If you want things to change in your favor then you need to vote for it. Also, I know that this is old news but I really don‚Äôt understand why people always think violence is the answer. Look what this worldwide riot sparked from. Police brutality. I happen to respect the police department but when there is an officer who uses unnecessary force or worse goes against all protocol and what has been taught, then I lose that respect. Trump‚Äôs answer during this crazy situation was to ‚Äúdominate‚Äù. I was disappointed not just because of how he spoke to the governors but also that he decided to use force as a first solution. should never be a first solution, no matter the circumstances. Here‚Äôs why. First depending on who you‚Äôre picking a fight with and how many, they might beat you senseless. Second all you are doing is making yourself look like the bad guy which is okay if you‚Äôre trying to conquer someplace but not such a good a idea to do with your own nation. Finally we have a thing called diplomacy. Ever heard it? Been around since the Roman Imperial Era? It doesn‚Äôt just apply with political agendas, if you know the country then it applies just as well to the public. Talking things out isn‚Äôt a guarantee, especially in the ‚Äúfree country‚Äù, but in emergency situations it‚Äôs a better first option than sending the National Guard. Violence is always met with more violence."
2,What should people do when we are physically threatened by those who are not peaceful towards us?
2,"So proud of you Mr. Acevedo...1 because you were chief here in Austin, TX, where I reside, 2 because you are now chief in Houston, where I was born & raised, 3 because you are an Orgullo Latino, 4 because you are a big hearted human being & I can just go on & on...anyways. God bless u always, Mr. Acevedo üôèüèΩ"

When Trump back these hate groups you protected him, a P.R. statement saying you refuse to support racism, then back Trump's hatemongering declarations the very next day. 

Who are you people to accept racism as a political platform? When David Duke supports Trump you did nothing, just give me my Tax Cuts and my Judges Mr. Trump.¬† 

African Americans are being attacked on the streets by Americans for, cooking, sleeping, shopping by Trump Supporters you could care less. 

When Trump broke the law dealing with Russia you protected him again. 

¬† Meanwhile, the hate groups are getting stronger, Anti-Governments Groups increase, but you Republicans do nothing. 

I say this as an independent voter you have permitted Donald Trump to become an American Dictator to keep your power. 

He Attacked Black Lives Matter for his supremacist racist base, for a Photo Op. 
The Republicans did nothing, Terrorist attacked Michigan's Capital you did nothing to stop Trump. 
Trump told the Proud Boys, I'm with you 
The Republicans did nothing. 
The Capital Has Been Attacked and you have settled back and have allowed Donald Trump and his followers to commit treason.¬† 

I say this to you honestly all of you are cowards to the Ameican People. It might not feel that way with the backing of Right-Wing Media, The Power and Money you have gained. 

We all saw it though, time after time watching you allowing Trump to do anything he wanted. 

A police officer has died and yes every one of you Republicans is to blame for his death, Fox News can't help you spin out of this. 

There is no honor, no integrity, or compassion within your party. 

Why do you ignore white supremacy and their organizations? 

Time won't heal this one, you have shown us who you are and we will never forget. 

Never Forget.

You‚Äôre so afraid of republicans because they all have a huge arsenal of weapons and ammo (at least that‚Äôs what you‚Äôve been saying to push the banning of weapons.) ü§î Yet, they didn‚Äôt bring any weapons to the ‚Äúinsurrection???‚Äù  You have to be very stupid to believe these leftists propagandists."
1,CNN blows
2,Man I think Brianna is one of the sexiest women alive just putting that out there lol if you happen to see this let‚Äôs talk lol
2,DOJ and Merrick Garland at fault for keeping a criminal free and not locked up
2,"You all are taking the bait. Hookline and sinker. Don‚Äôt fall for it. Our enemies foreign and domestic would love nothing more than to see this country tear itself apart. Democrats and Republicans need to stop watching the news and going on the internet, and start sitting down and start talking to each other. Really have a true conversation. They would find out they have more in common than they think."
2,"We need to ask Rep Cawthorn how many people are currently being held in custody for low-level offenses like marijuana and are too poor to post bail?
Bet he doesn't know?"

0,Conaldtrump is a malignant tumor in the heart of the U.S.
2,"I can‚Äôt believe MTG says something stupid like that. Everyone know it‚Äôs a double standard, you don‚Äôt need to remind us. More people died in mostly peaceful drone strike than at the Capital."
2,F... the traitors they are CRIMINAL prisoners and they will get what's coming and well deserved.
0,"We need to remember it's 30%, the Trump Republicans, the MAGA followers, the radical groups and the White Supremacists, that are trying to overthrow our democracy. If they do get in power, the government will be run as an autocracy and our rights will be taken away."
2,I would have opened fire on these protesters and shot them all with covid vaccine darts.
0,"i'm so happy the gop is sticking to trump, the big lie and the uneducated, white supremacists...
a few more moves like this and the gop will be IN the grave it's been digging since the orange nightmare."
0,"This is setting the stage for republicans to now start actually rigging elections by way of gerrymandering, voter suppression and putting election officials in place state by state to truly steel elections.  We are living in truly dangerous times."
2,Hang Mike Pence!' is obviously what innocent people would chant. (sic)
2,"NO, we should be prosecuted."
2,"Back in the day republicans supported  so called democrates
and independents against Democrates,  sunce republican demogages disrupting
Our voting rights to gain control of senate and congress,  Democrates should find money and votes to support honest  republican lawmakwrs,  legally to stay in their 
Seats without being 
Ousted or receive threats. support couragouse lawmakers who stand
Against insurrection of Jan6. 2020."
2,Arghhhh White People Mad!! Arrggg we have it so rough in the US!!!
2,These fools talking about the peaceful protestors as they were running for their life is rich. What a bunch of dweebs.
2,"Louie Gohmert you are of your mind....in plain sight

0,"Allowing Donald Trump into the White House was the worst mistake ever made, and the first and only moron ever entered the White House as a president."
2,Stand corrected. Federal Crimes. Damn uncivilized muts.
2,What‚Äôs funny is that it‚Äôs only 600 TRAITORS  arrested and only being charged with minor felonies or misdemeanors
0,Republicans are the lost Americans.
0,"The president is not ""saying what he's saying."" 45 is NOT the president. He is the ex-president, to be generous. He is an anti-American domestic enemy of US, to be accurate."
2,"The GOP still supports it, guys!! Lol. Desperation. Nobody showed up bc we weren't falling for it a second time. Quick question. Did they let that undercover Federal agent go? Lol. Now that was hilarious. They arrested one of their own. Guess the guy is all the riot gear didn't get the memo. He should feel thankful bc the ones who know usually end up getting Epsteined. Woops. I mean they commit suicide."
1,"Do you know who attended the rally? Undercover agents and media, like the one who was arrested by the capitol police. But you will never report that arrest. Trump supporters didn't take your bait and didn't attend the event. You failed miserably"
2,He needs to be removed from office and his team as well.
1,CNN reports BLM protests mostly peaceful while standing in front of a burning building.  You have to be an idiot to believe this propaganda machine of lies

1,"name the ""several that died"".....she lies to the viewers..and useful idiots and flying monkeys believe her. i'm republican and i still research them. people.....cya.....trust none of them....use common sense."
1,CNN the network of lies to cause division üëèüëèand the CNN  brainwashed followers who don't know how to think for themselves
1,It appears that the prisoners are political prisoners and are being treated this way simply because their misdirected passions supported former president Trump. The real violent insurrectionists were the ANTIFA and BLM rioters that terrorized communities across the country! Where‚Äôs the prisons holding BLM vandals in solitary confinement and denying them basic legal rights?
0,"Why are *you*, as journalists, going along with the false narrative that the rioters had no weapons????? It has been documented, as well as attested to by Capitol officers, that they *WERE* armed. They had stun guns, metal pipes, bear mace, tomahawk axes, baseball bats, AND HANDGUNS! I did a simple Google search on this. Why didn't you?"
2,What a bunch of cowards. If you believe then stand strong with YOUR people. They stand for nothing they represent themselves no one else. Disgusting
0,"I suppose if those people got what they wanted, we'd all be living a country that ISN'T the United States of America. I'm sure that Trump would have tossed the ""old Constitution"" and replace it with his own."
1,I bet the liberal media was just hoping for fighting and arrests.  Good news=NO NEWS with most media.
2,I support the insurrectionists that signed the Declaration of Independence.
0,"Non violent, peaceful protesters my ass.  The party of trump is a terrorist organization.  There should have been many more Ashley Babbits."
2,"Anyone who says that the protesters were not armed should be hit with flag poles, bear spray and hockey sticks until they change their minds."
0,France has pulled their ambassador out of the US for the first time ever. Lets see the left blame that one on Trump.
1,Boo CNN boo the home of fake Fu ing news!!!!!
1,"cnn trying really hard to stay relevant. This is not news, it‚Äôs all propaganda and the emotionally unstable are eating this up. Poor things."
0,trump is a criminal Traitor not in prison Why?
0,"Why do they always say it's Unpresesdent  or whatever they want to say, when they made a big deal of Benghazi so why can't we make a big deal out of January 6th?"
1,"Dear News Media:
Where is the video of thatü§°,Donald Trump alone,in some bushes,on the day of the insurrection,ENCOURAGING the people to walk up Pennsylvania Avenue,to the Capital Building,and protest the election results ?
He included:""I WILL WALK WITH YOU""(what?)
I saw that clip with my own eyes...I KNOW it exists!
It reminds me of the ""Reverend"",Jim Jones üò•üò™"
0,Louis Gomert is an idiot has been for years Only reason he keeps getting voted for is where he run Tyler right wing Texas
2,They aren't being held in solitary. What a moron.   10 years from now when some get get out of prison these nut jobs won't be around to give them a dime to get back into their fascist lives.
