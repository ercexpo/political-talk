0,Every conservatives accusation is a confession.
0,Remember when california Republicans put out fake ballot drop boxes to rig an ection? Pepperidge farms remembers.
0,Any time a con claims Dem fraud in elections they are lying or covering up their own fraud.
0,"Interesting that they never ask for recounts in precincts they win.

No fraud there, I guess."
0,"Because they're afraid of losing. This is just their coping mechanism.

Regardless of what the Insurrectionist Party thinks, keep voting no CA."
0,Their calls for a fraudit won't get far in the Dems' veto-proof majorities in the Legislature.
2,Why because we can all actually vote?
0,"The Republican Party has nothing to offer the American people aside from obstruction, hypocrisy, racism, cruelty, treason and childish stupidity."
0,Every GOP accusation in my lifetime has actually been a confession.
0,So fed up with them.  Every Californian who votes NO to this recall in CA has said they do not want any of the bs going on with the Republicans.
1,Real PATRIOT REPUBLICANS need to know that they are just wasting time trying to vote in these RIGGED ELECTIONS!   MAGA needs to PROTEST THE VOTE by staying home and voting where it matters: Facebook MAGA groups.

0,It's only rigged whe Republicans lose
0,"The Big Lie 'was coined by Adolf Hitler, when he dictated his 1925 book Mein Kampf, to describe the use of a lie so colossal that no one would believe that someone ""could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously."" '

0,Well duh they will do that forever now with every single election. It worked it got all the gullible to doubt the system. They can't admit to loss. They are to cowardly and arrogant to admit any fault. Hopeless bunch they are.
0,I remember when the GOP had some dignity.  Now?  Sad.
0,"I wouldn't worry, they probably think that the sun is rigged because it rises in the East instead of the West"
0,"Duh. The moment they think they'll probably lose, they immediately start fabricating fraud. Trump was talking about the ballots being a disaster before anyone even cast a vote. Was he the first president to ever get updates on ""the ballots"" in advance? Well clearly they get a lot of support claiming voter fraud, so this is probably just their new strategy when they don't think they'll win."
0,"I just watched Citizen Kane yesterday (a movie from 1941ish).  The main character who has parallels to the Orange one owns a Newspaper and runs for Governor.  His editor has two headlines ready to go, either ""Kane Wins"" or massive election fraud."
0,"They're not lying. It is rigged. By them. In their favor. 

It's the law of projection. It's strong enough to be used as evidence in a court of law. Anything a republican accuses their opponent of, they are guilty of themselves."
0,"What is that word that was thrown around SO much when Trump won? Not sure I can remember it. SNOWFLAKE.  That‚Äôs it. Yeah, snowflake. Didn‚Äôt the Republicans use that to describe ‚Äúlefties‚Äù who couldn‚Äôt deal with losing?  ‚ÄúDelicate snowflakes‚Äù."
0,If they think it‚Äôs rigged then boycott the election and don‚Äôt vote. üòà
2,Everything they conjecture is impossible.  Take 15 minutes to learn the voting process and you will discover this but they don't even bother.  Ginning up the rubes is much easier to do.
0,"I‚Äôve been watching Meet Kevin‚Äôs campaign, and it does seem like he‚Äôs getting fucked with by Instagram and the state department."
0,Change ‚Äúrigged‚Äù to ‚Äúwe‚Äôre losers‚Äù and you have the GOP narrative going forward.
0,"Beyond being outrageously wrong, this line is starting to sound old and tired, like the Republican base."
0,Well losing is hard. Even when you‚Äôre use to it. Get over it fuck nuts. You lost. Just like trump!
2,We will know in a few days just how rigged it was üòé
0,They never really expected to win. The con was basically to work the Trump angle and rake in a lot of cash from the election outrage. Trump is basically living off the election fraud donations now.
0,One good governor against 50 zombies.
2,They're a lot like BernieBros in that sense.
0,"GOP tranlation = oh crap, we're going to lose again."
2,"Not gonna pretend to be following the current counting but this did happen. 



I won‚Äôt say it will change the outcome but a few hundred here and a few hundred there in bigger elections is very problematic to me."
0,"They know they‚Äôre going to lose. But for them that‚Äôs still a win. They‚Äôre going to be much stronger going into the actual gubernatorial election in 2022 than they would have if they didn‚Äôt do this recall. That‚Äôs the point of the recall. To give them another campaigning and fundraising season before the election next year. 

Normally we wouldn‚Äôt be talking about who the Republican candidates are for governor this far out from the election, but because of the recall, these guys are household names now. They‚Äôve already won at what they were trying to do. Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt win them the office of governor in ‚Äò22"
0,"One of the characteristics of fascism is the public does not believe in the integrity of elections.  This serves fascism's purpose because then people do not vote. So whether they win or lose, casting doubt and trying to rig elections is a win for fascists.  The republican's have said it many times, if everyone was able to vote easily, they would never win another election."
2,Any idea when the riot is planned for?
1,I know they did fake ballot boxes.  But did Pepperidge Farms have something to do with it?

1,That would show those liberals!
1,The sun is bad is it rises in the East with China. :}
2,It's rigged but they didn't make it so.  Asking a recall and simply putting the guy with the most votes in office is ludicrous and asking for abuse.  The winner should have to get more votes than the Keep votes.
0,They aren't doing it to win. It's just another manufactured scandal to preach to their bas to keep them distracted for all the other bukkshit they are up to.
1,"And we have gotten to a point that no matter what is said, will be repeated mindlessly regardless of fact or even logic. Like woke and cancel culture."
0,At least the Bernie bros don't try to overthrow the government
0,"We'll be ready for 'em.


I mean in the most unfair and ridiculously run recall system ever, if they can't win, they certainly won't get a majority next year."
0,I like Meet Kevin.  I like how he points out how he is beating all the Republicans combined.  This was in the debate anyhow.  Really funny!
2,"There is one planned the dhe 18th. The day after the election in Washington D.C. 

Insurrection 2.0"
0,"Also if they do somehow squeak out a win in the recall, statewide it puts them at a disadvantage in ‚Äò22 because it means they will have a record they will have to defend. Imagine Larry elder trying to defend his record next year, which would undoubtedly be super unpopular. He‚Äôd lose re-election for sure. However, if he wins this recall, it will be good for the GOP nationally because they can push propaganda saying how even ‚Äúcrazy commiefornia‚Äù was fed up with democrats and chose a Republican governor (despite the fact that he can win the recall election without a majority of the state‚Äôs votes). They will use this as evidence to push the party further right and it will help them fundraise in other states, the logic being that if democrats are even too crazy for California, then they‚Äôre clearly too crazy for states like Missouri or Ohio. We really can‚Äôt let that happen. We‚Äôve got to prove to middle America that our candidates are far more reasonable and pragmatic and that the extremists are the republicans"
0,"Sorry, when you suggested Larry Elder winning the recall, I threw up in my mouth  a little.

He could never win in California using conventional means. I think he has other positions in his sight. Her has made a name for himslef amongst the Trumpiest of Trumpets. He will lose here  regardless but unfortunately, we won't have seen the last of this person who was virtually unknown 6 months ago."
2,"His future is definitely something to keep an eye on. From everything I‚Äôve seen from this guy, regardless of his political beliefs, he does not come across as someone who is qualified or ready to become governor tomorrow. He would be a disaster, even if we only have to deal with him for a year and a half, that‚Äôs a year and a half too long. But I expect him to announce his 2022 candidacy for governor very quickly after he loses the recall, and in that election, he‚Äôs going to get a lot of help from establishment republicans across the country, more than he‚Äôs getting now"
0,Oh god no. He is Trump times two. The guy would be a disaster.
0,"He would be awful. Crazy that he‚Äôs the front runner. I thought for sure faulconer would be. Faulconer btw is already running in 2022. So we‚Äôre likely going to see a head to head battle between him and elder next year. Would be cool if they split the vote from each other enough that were able to get two democrats running against each other in the general, but I suspect that elder will have the edge against faulconer judging by how CA republicans are stepping in line behind him"

He had a life changing event by getting past his addiction and seems to have transferred the energy he put into my pillow into Trump.

0,"SCOTUS has no business telling women what to do with their bodies. That‚Äôs why they avoided the irony to back abortion without ruling in favor of mask mandate. They can‚Äôt be pro-life when it‚Äôs convenient. BTW, Texas abortion law didn‚Äôt overturn Roe, it‚Äôs only valid in Texas. Other states will have to pass similar laws first, then they‚Äôll be challenged too."

The modern GOP is remaking the rules for elections and laws."
0,- current SCOTUS simply doesn;t have to take up any issue that any state passes and by defacto is valid law.  Lower federal courts have been stacked with batshit crazy conservatives so the courts will never be the same until they are cleansed or expanded.

0,"Their mothers must be so proud of her children passing this law. Until a grandchild becomes pregnant at 14. The pro life party has proven once again that the only life that matters is the one that can‚Äôt breathe. If you are on EBT benefits, need unemployment insurance, can‚Äôt afford insurance or you get sick enough with covid to die they just don‚Äôt care. Of course, they‚Äôll lie and tell Texans under 21 that all birth control fails and you should save yourself for marriage. We‚Äôve seen how well that‚Äôs working. The simplest thing to do to prevent abortion is to provide free long acting birth control to every woman who wants it. Or to give the guy a vasectomy. Let‚Äôs face it, he can infect more women with pregnancy than one woman can. Worked with a pos one time who was bragging because he had three women pregnant at the same time and on was either twins or triplets. All of whom would be raised on welfare."

0,"Let's think about this...

So a young woman gets pregnant, forced to drop out of school, or at the very least not attend higher level education. Furthermore, she is likely thrust into poverty, as is her child. In the case of the egg holder and sperm donor remaining together, it's likely one of them or both will suffer the same fate.

2,The stupid have a national soapbox now. The invention of the news cycle is going to be the death of us all. They run out of real news and just air opinion pieces to fill the time and boost ratings. Meanwhile the stupid don't realize it's just an opinion with no facts to back it up and they run with it.
0,"100% predictable as GQP got caught up in themselves. Was no smart move by Pelosi BUT the expected one she or any Majority leader would do and even then she initially allowed McCarthy to place members of his choosing and all he did was pick the biggest liars he had...and then was called out and he did the EXPECTED thing and took his ball hom,e, and then Pelosi outsmarted McCarthy once again with naming Liz Cheney and Adam  Kinzinger to the hearing. Not going to work out well for GQP.   Now the GQP will have to sit back and watch with no way to offer their lies in front of the American people as committee members who will be glued to the hearings, especially when 6-12 GQP are forced to plead the 5th on their participation and efforts. on TV in front of the world. NOPE, not going as expected. GQP can gaslight their easily led followers, but not the rest of America or the world"

0,I voted NO against the GQP's power grab and got my confirmation!
0,I voted No!  And mailed it.  The recall election needs to be voted.  It's a fascist attempt to circumvent democracy by the GQP.  VOTE NO!  Keep our democratically elected governor.
0,"I voted!!!  

Fellow Californians:  the ballot is right there on your dining room table or wherever you put your mail.  Open it, vote NO, then drop the ballot off in the mail or at a ballot drop box.  There are ballot drop boxes all over the place and outside every library branch!  

Do it NOW--we only have a week! 

This REALLY MATTERS.   We have Republican chaos agents, running a terrible, anti-vaccine, misogynist, anti-voting rights candidate named Larry Elder, he's leading, and the way this stupid recall is set up, he could become governor if we DON'T VOTE.  

VOTE!!!!!"
0,I moved to CA July 29 and the first thing I did was register to vote. Dropped my ballot in the mailbox earlier today. Fuck the CA GOP
0,"Make sure you choose a candidate, even though you're voting 'no'. There is a possibility that they win the recall, so vote for Dem to replace Gavin along with a 'no' vote on the recall."
0,"Already in and accounted for. Voted NO. 

If your curious about tracking your your ballot,

Ballottrax"
2,"If I lived in California, I'd be walking up to strangers saying, ""Governor Larry Elder?! Imagine that?"""
2,"Please, please vote No."
0,"To be cautious, I heard that even if you vote NO to the recall, you should also list a candidate you want if the recall succeeds. Cover all your bases, or you could end up with a Republican candidate who got to be governor with only a tiny fraction of the vote."
2,"If l could l would vote, but until then l must just engage in debate with those who voted for a candidate who wants slavery, and environmental destruction."
0,I voted.  This Elder person is an idiot.
1,I did. Dems are lazy voters so my fingers are crossed.
2,I‚Äôm from MN.  Can someone tell me what the vote is on?
0,Me and my wife read the candidate booklet. We were horrified. Gavin needs to stay otherwise California is fucked.
0,"And tell a friend (or 5)! And tell them to tell their friends!

I‚Äôm dying bc I was always the Californian phonebanking to swing states because ‚ÄúCA is so blue already.‚Äù I just moved out of state, and now there‚Äôs a frighteningly dire election in CA. üòí I‚Äôm trying to rally my people, though! Good luck, Cali. Sending love. üíôüíôüíô"
2,"After this mess, can CA use it's super majority to finally change the foolishly low bar for recall elections or place this as a ballot initiative because this is ridiculous and a waste of resources. 

What's the point of having a super majority if you can't even start the process of reforming such a foolish process."

2,100% done already!!! The second I got that ballot!
2,Sounds like your trying to influence an election by telling people how to vote. Why not just say go vote and let the people decide who to vote for?
0,"I told a friend about it today. They said they weren't going to vote but decided to vote when I explained to them what was at stake. In fact, they threw their ballot in the trash and had to dig it out! 

I'm glad they voted, but our fellow democrats need to be a little more active. Hell, the democratic messaging needs to change to and stress the urgency here."
0,"I would think so but they are not pushing that. 

Kevin Paffrath is the top democrat contender  but lags far behind Elder. 

I just don't understand why they are not pushing for people to  vote them dem just in case."
2,Very curious on which candidate is wanting slavery
2,He is like a Jewish Nazi
2,"I don't know about lazy... we have a higher proportion of individuals either prevented from voting, or for whom voting is more difficult."
0,"In California, a recall election can be put into motion solely by getting a petition signed by a proportion of state citizens equal to or greater than 12% of the number of voters in the previous office election. As such, to force a recall election of Gavin Newsom--who won with 62% of the vote in 2018--only required 1.4 million signatures, or 3.5% of California's population. The recall is costing California $276 million and represents an attempted power grab by Republicans to take advantage of a non-regular election to unseat the democratically-elected governor.

According to the law, the recall is based on two questions: question one is a yes or no question about recalling Gavin Newsom, and question two is who would replace him were the yes vote to receive a plurality of the vote. So, technically, 3.5% of the population forces the other 96.5% to turn out in an irregular election to vote ""no"" by a plurality, or the most popular ""other"" candidate running (currently Republican Larry Elder with about 26% popularity) becomes governor. If a plurality votes ""yes,"" regardless of who they prefer, a candidate with less than 30% popularity can supplant the governor elected with over twice that popularity during a standard, regular election."
2,Yeah but they‚Äôre more motivated to turn out than the Democratic voters :/
0,You're on a democratic party sub mate... I don't think anyone here will be influenced very heavily by this...
0,"Recall laws in California are very lax.   


Only 65 signatures need to start the drive to recall and only 12% of the total votes counted in the last election needed for the recall to proceed. FWIW, Newsom beat his last opponent by 24%. However at 12.5 million votes cast, only 1.5 million needed for a recall to proceed. It gives the GOP a second bite at every election if they choose to take it. Seriously broken.  


I urge all California, left, right and center, not to sit this one out."
0,"The reason they got 12% of voters to sign is because Covid extended their time to get signatures by 3 months. So they simultaneously bitch about Covid measures and owe it to Covid measures that they got a recall at all. 

12% of voters shouldn't be able to waste the time of the other 88% with this bullshit."
0,"You are amazing for doing this. Is there anyone else you can call? You seem to be a trusted voice of reason. 

&x200B;

This also reminds me of Nov. 4th. I had to call my aunt the day before to ask her if she is voting. She wasn't going to because my cousin (her daughter) always goes with her but had to work. I told her I'll stay on the phone with her while she waits in line, thank goodness I was working from home halfway across the country. So I listened to her random stories for an hour after calling 3 times to get her out of the house to the polls and sending her the polling location. 

She lives in NV so it was 100% worth the effort to get another vote for Biden. Then i convinced my exhausted cousin to stop at her polling place after pulling a double at work. +2 votes for Biden in NV! 

Seeing how close NV was warmed my heart for my little cross country voter outreach."

0,The black Trump    - The guy is the equivalent of a Jewish Nazi.
2,You Mean to tell me that in California a blue state that‚Äôs been blue for a long time that has some of the loosest voting laws in the country is disproportionally making it harder for blue voters to vote? You have even said everyone has a ballot MAILED to them. And you have plenty of places to vote. Tell me how is it hard to vote? It almost seems hard not to vote yet you are convinced it is still hard for people? Which people are disproportionately affected? I genuinely want to know.
0,I‚Äôve been telling my friends like crazy. Some ignore me but get through to some. My friend told me that they didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal. I hope people turn out in drones because every Republican is surely going to vote yes on the recall.

We cannot blame the Federal government, we blame the 70 million selfish rural Trumpers who refuse to get vaccinated and shed the virus to innocents. Now the kids are dying.

They should be shamed off the planet and Republicans must all be beaten in 2022."
0,"Vaccines for kids, yes. Boosters for immune compromised, the elderly etc, yes. But beyond that, we really need to start sending hundreds of millions of doses overseas.

Over and over and over it's the same thing. Past posts from people saying it's about control or freedom or whatever nonsense of the day, followed by the hospitalization and call for ""Prayer Warriors,"" then the death announcement followed by the standard Go Fund Me page. Mind blowing.

It's the Dad's leaving kids behind that's really hard for me take. Can't wrap my head around it."
0,Biden is a gentle transparent decent man. He is a refreshing change. We are lucky to have him now.
2,The administration could do a MUCH BETTER job of squelching misinformation. Why don't they?
0,"I'd agree with you but for the fact that so many of our people are still unvaccinated and chances of new variants developing are high. 

So boosters first for us since studies are showing that it really boosts our protections. Then by all means protect the world because unless everyone is vaccinated, we're not safe. It can spread again as it did the first time."

They should all sign a waiver saying they will voluntarily forgo a hospital bed in the event they get sick. Selfish self centered people that then go infect unsuspecting good people."

But Facebook and Twitter are worth hundreds of billions of dollars and are doing nothing about, which is a disgrace."

0,Watch Republicans slam companies for not supporting this for being ‚Äúwoke‚Äù.
2,"While corporate money in politics can be considered bribery, most of it is legal in the US. Many of these companies will fund anyone on committees that oversee their particular market, so just about every congressman, state or federal, gets political donations from big corporations, and if they are committee chairs or get lots of press, they get more, regardless of political affiliation, as long as that corporation feels they can expect preferential treatment access. Every bill is backed by congressmen who take corporate money. I doubt AT&T is donating to ban abortion specifically, they are likely donating to many state and federal-level stooges hoping they will regulate their industry in AT&T's favor. If those stooges also happen to be right-wing jack-asses? AT&T probably doesn't care."

Don't retcon the reason for the recall election to be all about the PG&E settlement. The recall was started by a racist, anti-vaxx former sheriff of Yolo County, who coincidentally was just diagnosed with COVID.

The Texas 'heartbeat ban' isn't medically accurate because there's no heart that early in pregnancy, providers say

Many women don't know they're pregnant at 6 weeks, when a pregnancy is still an embryo.¬†HUIZENG HU/ Getty Images

""Heartbeat bills"" are misnomers because there's no heart nor beating at 6 weeks of pregnancy.¬†

Doctors can only detect fluttering cells that will become the heart, and call it ""cardiac motion.""¬†

A 6-week pregnancy is an embryo, not a fetus, and fetal heart development is a continuum.¬†

The new¬†Texas law banning abortions after 6 weeks of pregnancy,¬†like others like it, is often referred to as a ""heartbeat bill,"" indicating a cutoff point when doctors can detect a fetal heartbeat.¬†

As Texas Governor Greg Abbot¬†said in a Facebook video¬†right before signing the bill, it ""ensures that the life of every unborn child who has a heartbeat will be saved from the ravages of abortion."" The law is expected to be challenged and, if it prevails, will go into effect September 1, 2021.¬†

But¬†Dr. Bhavik Kumar, a family medicine physician and abortion provider at the Planned Parenthood Center for Choice in Houston, told Insider ""pregnancies this early do not have a beating heart"" ‚Äî and that's a medical fact.¬†

For one, a pregnancy that's six weeks along is still an embryo. It's not a fetus until the 9th week after conception or 11th week after the last menstrual period, according to¬†Healthline.¬†

Plus, most women don't even know they're pregnant at six weeks, let alone get a doctor's appointment to confirm it.¬†

""At six weeks, most women would not have any clue they were even pregnant if they weren't carefully tracking menstrual cycles, and that doesn't even take into account the millions of women with irregular cycles who might go six weeks or longer between periods as a normal part of their life,"" Dr. Stephanie Ros, an OB-GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of South Florida, told Insider.¬†

She said at that point, the embryo is a quarter-inch long. ""It's barely noticeable on ultrasound, we often have to use transvaginal ultrasound to be able to see it at all,"" she said.¬†

What's really happening is 'cardiac motion' from cells that will become the heart

The so-called ""heartbeat"" that's detected at six weeks isn't a heart nor is it beating. ""There's electrical activity within cells that will become a heart, and we see that on an ultrasound machine as a flickering that can be audible through the machine,"" Kumar said. ""We refer to that as cardiac motion.""¬†

""Certainly different people have different feelings around seeing that and what that means,"" Kumar added, ""and that is up to each person to decide how they value that.""¬†

Indeed, the president of the¬†American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which represents more than 60,000 OB-GYNs in the US,¬†made a similar point in 2019¬†in opposition to ""heartbeat bills.""

""Pregnancy and fetal development are a continuum,"" he said. ""What is interpreted as a heartbeat in these bills is actually electrically induced flickering of a portion of the fetal tissue that will become the heart as the embryo develops."" That tissue continues to develop throughout the first trimester.¬†

Only in the past few decades has the technology been advanced enough to detect cardiac motion that early, Dr. Saima Aftab, medical director of the Fetal Care Center at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami,¬†told LiveScience in 2019. The fluttering, she said, also doesn't indicate the viability of the future heart or the pregnancy.¬†"
2,"I get it. I‚Äôm team thanos, I want less people on earth. If we pronounce people dead when their heart stops, then it's not out of this world to start life when the heartbeat starts. And if they did the bill for 9 weeks for the heart to develop, we would still have the same outrage."
1,"Cue the ""we need to deny welfare to unwed mothers who blatantly 'decide' to have a baby"" crowd."
1,"I really want to have a discussion, about this, No politics, no name calling, just a simple discussion, I understand what this article is saying, but I want to know why it does not bring up adoption, just give the child up to an adoption agency or surrender it to the hospital upon delivery this way the hospital can give it to an agency that can give it to a family that really might want it?"
0,"Funny because I, a blue state resident, is keeping red states like Texas afloat by the taxes I pay."
0,"How does that alleviate the burden of carrying a rapist's child?  How does that (to put it bluntly) undestroy their body?  How does that prevent the hospital bill, or the trauma of childbirth?  How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria?  How does that make it less of an economic burden to take an unwanted child and foist them into a poorly organized and definitely underfunded foster system (it's Texas, in case you think they care) that _mostly_ results in molestation, prostitution and abuse?  How does that not further the burden of guilt placed on someone who never wanted that child to begin with?

Utterly and completely destroying a good section of the work force, emotionally, physically, financially and in all ways permanently, (unless they have a neuralizer, panacea or a winning lottery ticket respectively) is not good for the economy.

And that's just considering the unlucky and unwilling mother.  What of her coworkers, or her significant other?  They have to pick up the hours or those companies simply do without, resulting in lost revenue, quality, and supply.  Have you ever worked a 12 hour double shift, or an 8 hour triple shift?  Because I fucking have, and I wasn't even involved.  Now you have to deal with burn out and turn over from an entirely unrelated set of people, time into training and damaged product or shoddy services resulting in slow-down FOR 9 MONTHS.  And that's if they can come back at all!  The U.S. at large basically doesn't even have a support system for pregnant people if you compare it to other first world nations.

There is no ""what if we try x."". This is a bad law designed to make broken homes that a political base can scapegoat and slavewage 16 years down the line.  It is designed to be economically expensive because that's _the whole point._"
2,"Do you know how much an abortion at planned parent hood or some other abortion clinic is? Honest question I do not know. I found planned parent hood says it could be $0-$1,500. but I am not sure what other places charge, I know in a hospital it can be 5,000 or a bit more for vaginal birth or higher for C-section. How can any women really afford a abortion then or delivery period then? 

You talk about How does that (to put it bluntly) undestroy their body? or the trauma of childbirth? How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria.  Have you seen the side effects of both a hormonal pill abortion or a medical abortion? For hormonal pill, it is not unusual for a women having to go to the hospital because the bleeding does not stop, but continues to get worse. Some women become sick and mentally damaged seeing that amount of blood and the cells of the baby after cleaning up that mess, During the surgical abortion where they stick a vacuum up there, it is not unusual for the doctor to cause damage to the uterus and other organs that actuary harm the chance of having another baby in the future, along with bleeding, and causing tears that might need to be surgically fixed. So you will have to go to the hospital for surgery. which case is all traumatic in my opinion. and more of an economic burden now they have more bills to pay. (not saying vaginal birth or C-section is better they all have their risk too)

to your other argument, why cant an employer higher a temp from an agency? There are temp agency that people do sign up with to find part time work, they usually work part time or full time during a short period of work, do you think those short term workers would like to have that job for a bit?"

2,"Brazilians are clowns...I know it  ran away from the country as soon as I could. The truth however is more complex and it is not fully portrayed around the world. There are things, a few of them where Bolsonaro is right and on point, others show how ill-suited he is. With that being said, the options were even worse in the last elections.
The Supreme Court in brazil is the biggest joke there ever was, it needs to be completely reformed (The US supreme court should also be reformed, by the way)
The brazilians have a supreme court where ANY lawyer, appointed by a POLITICIAN can become a member, no need to be a judge, no need to be someone suited for the job, and that is a lifetime position! ANY supreme court that is unbiased and trustworthy need to be populated by FEDERAL JUDGES, appointe by election amongst all federal judges in the country, and I said JUDGES, not mere, ill-prepared lawyers. The political appointment process needs to be eliminated, and until it is so, no one will trust the courts. (that holds true in Brazil, US or any democracy).
Also, the voting issue, Bolsonaro is for electronic PLUS paper ballot, so it could be audited, similarly to the US...imagine an election where the electronic votes could not be audited? Yes, that is Brazil. But guess, the brazilian (comunists-inclined) opposition is against that. There is no transparency throughout society, and a society that has its powers opaque to its population, is a democracy of the rich and powerful, (like Russia, Belarus, China....and the list goes on) and all of these countries, including Brazil and US are heading that way unless structural changes are made....and those are usually painful. Inhave little hope though."
0,"You are saying shit. Bolsonaro supporters want a coup to keep Bolsonaro in the power as a dictator, it is what they truly dream of. 

Bolsonaro fighting corruption? Haha You must idolatrate  him to say this nonsense. 
Even the Lava-jato operation that has put Lula in jail he fought against. Now, we  know that his whole family is involved  crimes of stealing money of their employees in the government. He also protected the guy that as asking bribes when buying vaccine."
0,"I agree, there are a lot of reasons why Bolsonaro got there in the first place. I even voted for Bolsonaro in 2018, but because I was disillusioned with the polarized reality of that time and thought he represented a drastic change and action, but as it turns out he was another right-wing populist nutjob, and I slowly began realizing it just like many americans did with Trump. You rightfully point out the Supreme Court is politically appointed, but guess who appointed a judge who freed Lula from jail? You rightfully point out corruption is rampant, but guess who is the one who destroyed the Car-Wash Operation? Yes, Bolsonaro, because turns out, he is a corrupt crook along with his entire family. In the beginning, I used to believe that ""Bolsonaro is a fascist who wants to be dictator"" was just leftist conspiracy, but the more he began actually voicing against democratic institutions, the more I realized all these speeches about ""cleaning the swamp"", or about ""saving the nation"", or about ""the corrupts within congress"" have always been far-right dogwhistles and I had fallen this conspiracy rabbithole, which I have slowly been escaping ever since the pandemic began.

So no, there's no such a thing as ""communist-inclined"" opposition against Bolsonaro, because a lot of prominent right-wing political movements such as the MBL broke off with Bolsonaro, so his opposition is pretty broad even though there are indeed left-wing people in the opposition, just like every opposition against a far-right government. No, there is no such a thing as ""Bolsonaro is for electronic plus paper ballot"", because even if he was for that, the true intention of his when voicing for this agenda is to make people distrust the system and de-stabilize democracy so he can come out as ""the man who will solve it all"", and this entire agenda of electronic plus paper ballot is another dogwhistle for ""the democratic system is bad and I want to be dictator"". Yes, there is no transparency throught society and yes Brazil is a banana republic, but the ""twist"" is that Bolsonaro himself is part of the infamous ""Centr√£o"" of brazilian politics, you know, the ""banana politicians"" themselves, of the rich and powerful?

To summarize: the only thing Bolsonaro ever did for Brazil is to pave the path for the gangsters of Lula to come back and continue their legacy of corruption in the name of the poor, he destroyed the legacy of the sane right-wing who only wanted to fight the corruption of Lula and the PT, and most importantly: the deaths of thousands who fell into his far-right rethoric that the ""virus doesn't exist"", or ""if it exists, China made it up"", just like what happened to many americans with Trump. So fuck Bolsonaro, fuck his far-right nutjobs and fuck his terroristic ""milicias""."

It's natural to be disappointed when we can't get everything we want, but let's keep things in perspective.

Even then, they've been getting things down at a historically breakneck space.

Theres the old adage,  ""dems fall in love, Republicans fall in line"" which holds true and why we don't see th Qcult kicked to the curb (or tea party).

Yeah, it took trump to turn out the dem vote. Issue is, the ones who can and need to move the country forward at a quick step,  are millennials,  who just aren't old enough to be reliable voting bloc. 

The major focus really needs to be on un-fuhking the gerrymandered states and allow for more easy access.

2,"Insisting on bipartisanship and going after the moderate republican vote instead of putting forward legislation that may be controversial, but is vehemently supported, ie, Medicare for All, aspects of the Green New Deal, cannabis reform, raising the min wage. But they largely remain silent on those bc their corporate donors don‚Äôt want it, and they‚Äôd have to actually do work to convince people on the fence. It‚Äôs easier and safer for them to do nothing."
0,"That's pretty much what I said... isn't it?

I didn't disparage dems, I just said they aren't stepping up to the plate as needed, but Republicans are certainly toxic and guaranteed destruction of our democracy."
2,"Being that you're first sentence was a fact less, baseless assumption,  you no longer have any credibility with me... you are why progressives lose... you don't think you just rage... starting off a response with a stupid assumption that also has the narcissistic side dish of touting how amazing you are is not only off putting but embarrassing for you... 

If you want to have a real discussion try again... you get one more chance."
2,"Well, many of them discussed m4a, with side options (Warren, yang, Sanders). 

UBI was on the main stage for the first time, discussed and made its way into the public arena, including cities instituting it. 

"
0,It's a little bit more complicated than you're presenting it. We're on the razor edge of holding power and barely holding together a coalition with moderate democrats. As a progressive myself sometimes it feels like this non yielding outlook is naive. In order to get what you're demanding requires us to make gains in the house and Senate. Throwing away your vote in protest almost guarantees you'll never get what you want.
2,I'm not trying to persuade you. You are as dense as the fascists.  I'm probably going to just leave.
0,"If you want all that, stop talking shit on Democrats and make sure they get elected.  I've lived in Virginia for 20 years, and for the first time last year Democrats achieved a statewide trifecta:  the governor's mansion and both houses of the legislature.  Since that time, Virginia has legalized cannabis, raised the minimum wage, secured voting rights, expanded public healthcare, passed environmental protections, and a host of other things you no doubt value.

You know how they did it?  By having a solid majority where Democrat legislators from more conservative areas could defect on certain issues.  Republicans did NOTHING to help any of this happen, but Democrats still had the numbers because their majority is solid.

""Both sides are the same"" is the stupidest, most counterproductive thing people are saying right now, and it needs to stop.  It's not based on fact.  It's something half-informed people say to make themselves sound skeptical and savvy, but in the end it only destroys any chance of making progress."
0,"I think you responded to the wrong person.  I'm not a progressive.  I'm a left-leaning moderate.  I used to be an occasional swing voter too.

And I don't actually believe you're any sort of Democrat at all.  Just a Republican in disguise trying to sow division in the party.  Make claims to the contrary all you want; it's your actions that show it."
2,Weren‚Äôt they discussing ways of NOT doing it? And only one of those is a Democrat anyway. Yang and Sanders are independents aren‚Äôt they?
2,"Vote for the people who start the fire or the people who don‚Äôt put out the fire, either way you burn."
2,">ways of not doing it

They were talking about side options for companies and squabbling over nuance but it was a solid push for m4a with a few different flavors. 

>independents

I don't think so, they are democrats but at the edges of the current tent and appeal to progressives and *some* independents (and fringe ""libertarians."" Whom are often ignorant of what libertarianism is and want to be contrarian, or - and I contend, a large portion are made up of bots bad faith internet actors. Look at the Bernie subs and bizarre overlap with thedonald + redpill+ language).

Edit: this isn't to say Bernie voters are not real, I know plenty who were,  they just didn't act like or talk like what you see in those subs or online.  Most of the Bernie bros hate major portions of the internet (millennials) for security concerns.  At least, the ones I know irl."
2,I wonder how this all works out with her security detail. They probably have to sweep the place every morning.
0,"The Republican'ts are so desperate to turn this into a ""beige suit"" moment that they don't realize it's 2021 and it's going to backfire on them gloriously. Progress is coming, and progressives will need to VOTE! Slogans are useless. JUST VOTE!"

0,Republicans always fear mongers regarding guns. If you pass laws restricting guns it‚Äôs just the beginning.  They‚Äôll take all our guns away. Now they are literally doing the same thing with abortion and women‚Äôs rights.
0,Texas is turning into Gilead
0,"Texas won't secede because... Honestly I'm too exhausted to explain why the state can't at this point. It just can't. As for most rational Texans, we're American, or at least we try and uphold the things that originally made this country and state great, however those assholes ""in charge"" are very un-American, they spit in the face of those that know what it means to be Texan. Thankfully we have some elections coming up soon. 

As for stepping foot in the state, don't. You're not missing out on anything (honestly what the hell would someone even come here for?). Save your money and buy yourself something nice with it. Deny this state your sales tax. You want to hurt a man, hurt him in the wallet."
2,"I'm going to have an unpopular opinion here, but it is not all of Texas. It is the oppressive political system they are in and if they secede, the women affected by the barbaric laws they are making will have even fewer rights. 

I understand the frustration with a portion of that state, but the what the Democrats in that state have been doing shows the desperation of a large section of the population. The productive action would be to call for justice and national influence to be put on those passing these laws. Please do not forget that the state is not a monolith and you condemn all of them with statements like this.

Edit: I guess I didn't know how to spell secede."

2,How about Texas democrats start selling it better and fucking up the GOP instead.....when dipshits in Texas like Beto O'Rourke go on record saying he will vote to ban the guns most Texans have as a prime example...Texas Democrats look like they're just as fucki g stupid as the rest of the damn state.  Until Texas Dems get smart & sell it better to their rural constituents you're gonna get fucked up the ass every time.
2,"They're doing it themselves, notice how there's been no legislation at all concerning the failing energy grid and winter is coming. Those people are obsessed with cultural issues that don't effect their daily lives at all, unlike their failing energy grid. Darwinism in action"

0,"It's ironic how republikkkans will give billions of dollars to rich, big businesses ""to help the economy"", but giving the average person money to buy goods that would actually stimulate the economy is a non-starter.

Keep people down is the only way they stay in power.

Instead of paying people's electric bills. Why not pay to have solar panels put on their house. But that takes money out of the pockets of the people giving ""OUR"" representatives money.

Hmmm....."
0,I am starting to think that they want the working classes to stay poor and desperate  so that they'll be easier to exploit.... am I wrong for this?

2,What was your expectation arrest Trump ? that‚Äôs not how law works
2,Women is protected by Texas law it‚Äôs providers who were in trouble
0,"Garland is only one among a line of lawmen that turn out to be wet farts; such as Patrick Fitzgerald, Comey, Mueller, Cy Vance‚Ä¶ 

It easier to just accept that they aren‚Äôt here to help us but to maintain the integrity of the system."
2,"Yes, but the FACE Act, in its wording, protects both women and facilities."
0,"The thing is, if ""pro-life"" conservatives truly wanted fewer abortions, they would 100% support better sex education in schools and easier (or free) access to contraceptives, because those are the only two reliable methods of reducing the number of abortions. 

They go on and on about ""saving the life of the child"", but what about the quality of life for that child? Are Texas voters going to improve their foster care system? Will they support giving financial aid to mothers who can't afford the children that they never wanted? I don't hear any mention from them about what they are willing to do to support these unwanted children. 

Why are they silent about helping these unwanted children? Because they don't really care about the children. They only care about punishing women for being sexually active. They want women to suffer because those women aren't conforming to their conservative ideals."
0,"Pro-Life Religious Conservatives also love advocating for people who are on life support but will otherwise not get better. People who cannot advocate for themselves e.g. the braindead or the unborn are a great campaigning point for the conservative right because it requires no resources and allows them to both scare people and make people angry at the perceived moral backwardness of progressives. See this podcast about Terry Schiavo for a great example

"
0,Yeah no wonder rightoids chose the heart over the brain when deciding what‚Äôs alive
2,So what restrictions are we placing on men then?
0,"In all fairness, while a fetus doesn‚Äôt yet a conscious, they are still likely to be born (unless there‚Äôs a as opposed to a brain dead person

Regardless, before the fetus is viable, it has no brain function and is on the same level as a brain dead person. The heartbeat argument isn‚Äôt a good one."
0,"Republicans once tried to steal a brain-dead woman from her family to keep her alive as a way of responding to exactly this argument.    
"
2,Is it illegal in Texas to put the fetus on life support and then pull the plug?
0,"Well, I think some Republicans are smart enough to realize that if they outlaw pulling life support on people who are brain dead, hospitals would be overwhelmed with care for individuals who had no chance of walking out the door again.

But Republicans have no problem telling women they need to be life support for a fetus, whether the woman chooses to or not."
0,The same people yammering on about abortion being murder believe that pulling the plug on a brain dead person is also murder. Remember Terry Schivo?
2,These monsters oppose that too. No matter how much their grandma is suffering they will refuse to end her misery.
0,"There is no logic when dealing with people willing to do mental gymnastics to fit their square beliefs into the round holes of reality. Let‚Äôs not get into the argument of let‚Äôs force motherhood on girls but not force fatherhood on boys. Or here‚Äôs a good one that‚Äôll put them in a logic loop, if an illegal immigrant is pregnant does that mean her child is a us citizen?"
2,"This is a messy analogy. Obviously a fetus at six weeks is ‚Äúalive‚Äù both sides know this. A brain dead person is at the end of their conscious and a fetus is at the beginning. That‚Äôs the real difference.

I don‚Äôt think republicans chose the heartbeat detection because that means human life. They think it‚Äôs human life from the start. They just know they have to keep it legal in SOME capacity, no matter how minor. The heart best is a symbolic choice for them. And it just so happens to be before most women even know that they are pregnant."
2,"Thinking back to Terri Shiavo, I'm pretty sure conservatives were arguing not to unplug her."
0,i‚Äôm all for abortion but how is someone about to die and someone ab to be born comparable
1,Interesting argument but the difference is that braindead people will never be cognitive again whereas fetuses are still growing into cognitive people
2,Let‚Äôs go with just not killing people at all. That would be nice.
0,"Throw in emergency contraception as well(Plan B, or the ‚Äúmorning after‚Äù pill). Because people make mistakes."
0,"I was born to an ill-treated mother who hated girls, couldn't succeed in her efforts to in induce a miscarriage, and couldn't cope with having a 5th child at 25.  In my 60s I still suffer from the mental and physical injuries. I wouldn't wish my childhood onto anyone. 

Women must be free to choose, not just for their own sakes, but for the sake of their children."
0,"This is of course correct. They don‚Äôt want abortions to go down, they want women to stop having sex (except with them of course). It isn‚Äôt about abortion, it‚Äôs about sex and who they think should and shouldn‚Äôt be having it."
0,"Its 100% about judgment and control. If you allow free access to contraceptives and sex ed, you are condoning sinners. To them, its a sin trade- sex or abortion."
0,I‚Äôve long held that any pro lifer that has their own kids instead of adopting is a hypocrite.
2,They should be pulling the plug on a lot of the COVID patients in ICUs. What a delusional waste.
1,I mean an abortion is just pulling the plug as well. The plug in this case is a womb.
0,"Everything that the religious right supports makes sense in the context of punishing women for sex and does not make sense in the context of preventing abortions: abstinence only education, prohibitions on birth control and lack of government support for families. At some point in time we have to stop giving abusers the benefit of their word."
1,Yes but the definition of ‚Äúlife‚Äù and ‚Äúalive‚Äù can be debated based on what you believe. According to science everything is alive in some way as long as the cells are alive
0,That was one very public case. Brain dead people get taken off life support every day and not a peep from the right. They also have no issue with taking a human life if they feel the human doesn‚Äôt deserve to live(executions).
0,"There is no difference. 

Either you support life, or you don‚Äôt. 

The republicans do not. 

You cannot claim to be pro life and be in favor of the death penalty.

You cannot claim to be pro life and be in favor of someone who refuses to wear a mask, knowing doing so may kill a child."
0,That‚Äôs horrific and sad. So many tragic stories that get conveniently ignored by people who call themselves religious. I am so GD tired of these people ruining the entire world for everyone else. So tired and so angry that I hope they do not get vaccines and get to meet their sky daddy sooner than later. The preverbal silver lining.
0,"Woah, that seems to be quite a severe reaction to a joke about the unconstitutional stupidity going on in Texas. Guess you aren‚Äôt competent enough to have a baby or raising children either. Womp womp."
2,The type of people who shouldn‚Äôt be raising children include people who hide behind a screen and throw needless insults at strangers. I‚Äôm sure whatever little spawn comes from you will also be an asshole.
2,I agree that some of these people just don‚Äôt want what they perceive as an easy out for irresponsable sexual behaviors. Yes But a lot of these people very genuinely believe it‚Äôs wrong to end a human life in the womb. And not everyone who believes that is religious or even conservative.
0,"Irrelevant, neither have the right to use someone else's body or resources to continue existing. 

If a person needed one of your lungs to live, should you be forced to give it to them?"
0,BUT THE NEWS SAID ‚ÄúIT WAS THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT!‚Äù AND MY FRIENDS SAID ‚ÄúTHEY WANT TO PUNISH WOMEN.‚Äù WHY ARENT YOU AGREEING WITH ME!?
0,"Why should it matter? It is an embryo not a baby. It is a woman's choice, nit the court's or government's while still not viable outside her body. Forcing a woman to carry is inhumane. Back to illegal, unsafe abortions?"
0,"""Noone has the right to use someone else's body or resources to continue existing""
The point is true in all aspects but it still extends way after a person is born, Infact, baby, children and even many teenagers may not be equipped to survive. In so the argument you provide also excuses a parent putting their infant baby on the street and leave."
2,"No. I mean, I think that‚Äôs a weak analogy. But yes, I agree abortion should be legal.

Abortion is killing a human. But sometimes it‚Äôs legal to kill humans. War. Abortion, endings brain dead people."
2,The media is full of shit on both sides. I believe abortion should be legal. I also think it is infanticide. And Im a Democrat. All these things can be true at once.

2,"Right so if you‚Äôre bad at covering something up, that makes it okay? What are you saying? And why won‚Äôt you just call the Taliban terrorists like they are? That‚Äôs not really a controversial label. And also, how can you say Trump was ‚Äúsiding‚Äù with the Taliban by making deals, but then when Biden misjudges the Taliban‚Äôs invasion, and is forced to make deals with those terrorists directly BECAUSE OF HIS OWN MISTAKE, the Taliban is just ‚Äúthe ones that have to be dealt with‚Äù. Yes, they are now, but please think about WHY and how that could have been avoided.

Trump was an absolute idiot and a creep, but it‚Äôs ok to criticize Biden when he messes up too."
2,"I believe I've seen the shortened version of that video before... But even then, the arguments they were giving were all superficial and no real substance involved. I also noticed the black conservatives also tried to dominate the conversation for the most part...and it kinda still all backs to conservative view points of ""I've got mine, fuck you guys"""
2,Why do you call them leftist?
2,Mostly the violence
0,"Quite right. I thought the tone was visible, but it wasn't, so I edited my post. Our universities have a wide range of political stances, but the accepted trope on the right is that all the professors are either Marxist Svengalis or virtuous right-wing conservatives hounded out of academe. Of course, it's idiotic. Just ask Hawley or Cotton, those Harvard prettyboys."
2,"Um, not really. It's not like it's a Western Civ book club that has one guy who broke a window and now the WHOLE CLUB is unfairly branded as window-breakers. The point of the organization is to incite street fights and parade around in uniform. Often with police, invited or not. In this, they are little different than the English blackshirts.

That they make noises about Western Culture doesn't impress me any more than do the noises jihadists make about religion."
2,"I was asked a question (that has been deleted) about ""what civ"" I'm ""proud"" of. Interesting question!

I was raised steeped in Western culture. Grandparents in the German film industry, photographer dad, actress mom. They taught me (some) German and French. Went to international school. Studied physics and medieval studies in a college with a Great Books program. 

I can't think of a better way to spend an afternoon than at the Met or MOMA. 

Am I ""proud"" of Beethoven and Mozart? I had nothing to do with them. I enjoy them, I love them, I am deeply moved by them. But pride implies personal achievement. Just look it up: 

1. feeling deep pleasure or satisfaction as a result of one's own achievements, qualities, or possessions or those of someone with whom one is closely associated.
""a proud grandma of three boys""
2. having or showing a high or excessively high opinion of oneself or one's importance.
""a proud, arrogant man""

I am quite proud of a short play I wrote that got a good review in the NY Times. It brought me to LA where I met my wife who was a TV writer. (Our little joke is that we met through the NY Times.)

I am proud of my father's work, with which I had little to do, but I helped him in the darkroom and changed his film sometimes. 

I work in the space program and I'm proud of that, though I'm in a support position and have nothing to do with designing or selecting missions.

But to be ""proud"" of Monet or Voltaire just seems bizarre to me. I love them and would defend them, and I'm deeply moved by them, and would be devastated if the works were destroyed. But pride doesn't enter into it."
0,But Manchin and Sinema believe the filibuster (a senate rule) is somehow more democratic than the enumerated rights such as the 14th and 15th amendments of the constitution.
2,They should eliminate the filibuster to protect VOTING rights.
0,"Lemme fix this

Amy Klobuchar: Senate should eliminate the filibuster to protect ~~abortion~~ rights"
0,"I love the fact that every time I get an email about an important issue saying: ""contact your representatives now!"" I get to just say naw, I'm good. They got this.

Smith, Klobuchar, Omar. Three fucking amazing women. Glad they represent me."
0,"Protect voting rights first.  Then follow up and protect health care and then abortion rights. 

Just my opinion"
2,"So what happens if we lose seats in the midterms. Filibusters are there to protect the minority party. What we do now can be used against us, just like the so called nuclear option was."
2,"The problem is that Senators no longer stand and filibuster.  They send an email and go home. 

We need to return to the stand and talk filibuster.  When you sit, you quit. Then we vote."
0,And voting rights. And the climate.
0,Even worse there are at least two ‚Äúdemocrats‚Äù (Manchin being one) who aren‚Äôt pro choice ‚Ä¶
2,"It‚Äôs not just Manchin and Sinema. 

Joe Biden also wants to keep the filibuster."
2,Agreed! A senate rule shouldn‚Äôt outweigh rights given under the constitution.
0,"That‚Äôs what concerns me too. If we eliminate the filibuster and the GOP grabs the majority? Texas‚Äôs law will look like child‚Äôs play compared to what could be done at the Federal Level.

Personally? I think that we should go back to the old filibuster rules(talking nonstop until the speaker wears out)."
0,"The last time republicans took over the senate, McConnell eliminated the filibuster. That‚Äôs how they confirmed all those federal judges and SCOTUS conservative judges. So yeah, Manchin and Sinema are pretty naive to believe if republicans win the senate, the filibuster will still be around."
1,"Lol, yeah. The GOP has really shown a pattern of following the rules in the past. 

This shit right here is why the Dems, who represent like 60% of the country's population, can't get anything done. When the GOP get power, they fucking use it. When the Dems gets power, they waste 18 months trying to be polite and bipartisan, then get fucking crushed in the midterms.

Voting rights, reproductive rights, climate efforts, income inequality reduction, and every other democratic effort is going to fail in the name of tradition and decorum."
0,It‚Äôs fun how you think McConnell isn‚Äôt going to eliminate the filibuster at the first available opportunity the moment they take control in 2022.
0,"And please understand abortion is nowhere to be found in the Bible nor the constitution. BTW, anyone who believes in pro-life should back vaccines and mask mandates aimed at saving lives."
2,"Biden‚Äôs era of good governance is way behind us. His years in the senate are very different from what we‚Äôre seeing today. During Trump tenure, we‚Äôve seen a complete erosion of moderates and bipartisanship in congress. The guy is like a high school kid asking for his BFF to fight on his side. Biden can‚Äôt get his agenda passed, unless either Manchin and Sinema stop annoying us with their ‚Äúfilibuster is democracy‚Äù non sense, or republicans won‚Äôt use it to sabotage the democratic agenda."
0,"That‚Äôs what concerns you? 

What concerns me is McConnell absolutely eliminating the filibuster just to punish Dems for talking about doing so, and everyone being all ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt do that‚Äù as he proceeds to do it, followed by ‚Äúwell nothing we can do I guess.‚Äù"
0,"If you don't get rid of the filibuster then the GOP wins the midterm elections.

Then they get rid of the filibuster.

Then they take away your right to vote"
2,"That was the so called nuclear option, and was voted in by democrats during the previous administration. Lets not make the same mistake again."
0,"Go for it then, and end the filibuster, and then come on here crying because the GOP got a majority and used your rule against you. They didn't write the nuclear option, we did, now you crying cause they used it. They didn't break any rule, they used the rule we wrote."
1,"It's fun how he used a Democrat rule to do it last time, and people like you can't understand how every new rule you put in place can and will be used against you. It feels good for the moment though, right. How's watching everything you accomplish with that rule get torn down in 2022 gonna feel."
2,"It. Is. Not. Just. Manchin. And. Sinema. 

I‚Äôd be willing to wager there are around 8-10 Democrats who would vote to protect the filibuster if it came down to it on the floor."
2,"My biggest fear about Biden, once I realized he was the only one who could win against trump, was that he knew how serious this moment was, but wouldn‚Äôt step up to it. 

My fears are being proven true every single day."
2,"They could‚Äôve gotten rid of the filibuster when they had slight control‚Ä¶but didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶.why?

Because they knew that getting rid of it would mean that every time the power structure changed, previous legislation could be undone with a simple majority."
2,"Sure, but you don‚Äôt use the nuclear option when convenient, for the simple fact, it overrules the filibuster."
1,"
Why were the democrats forced to go nuclear? You know why. Cut the ‚Äúit‚Äôs the democrats fault for going nuclear‚Äù crap. 

Would you rather they just shrug their shoulders and do nothing? 

‚ÄòCome on."
2,Well... they actually are the ones who ended filibusters for supreme court justices.
2,"I won't be complaining, but to be fair I've completely given up on this shit hole country. We've got like 2 actually liberal senators, 52 conservatives, and 46 who are very concerned on Twitter. I'm just hopeful I can emigrate before it gets much worse."
2,"Imagine thinking the filibuster is gonna save us after Republicans take control in 2022. 

Wow. 

You clearly haven‚Äôt been paying an ounce of attention, have you?"
0,"Quote it. And please, I don‚Äôt want to hear ‚Äúthou shall not kill‚Äù that‚Äôs not abortion."
0,"Again, Biden grew up in a very different era of good government and don‚Äôt expect him to change. McCain was from his era and so ‚Äúwere‚Äù Lindsay, Collins and Murkowski. But since Trump came in, it hasn‚Äôt been the same on the republican side of the aisle. Not that Biden isn‚Äôt doing anything wrong at all. In fact, he‚Äôs on the right side of history. We‚Äôre simply faced with a different era of bad government led by conspiracy theorists in congress and state governments with ZERO knowledge of American government and history per se."
2,"You have no idea why they did what they did.  

I was a lifelong Republican, until 2017.  The GOP of today does not resemble the GOP of 2015."
0,"So you mad about the Republicans using a procedural rule that Democrats came up with to do something you didn't like. And using that as justification to make an even more easily abused rule because it benefits you at the moment, with no concern for the Republican abuses that are almost guaranteed.  Talk about short sighted."
0,"Huh, I‚Äôm saying that the only thing the Bible says about abortion is a recipe for, quite literally, performing an abortion, commanded by God, in the tabernacle nonetheless. I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúthou shalt not kill‚Äù has to do with it. 

"
0,"We‚Äôre going to have to agree to disagree. 

Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm 38, and my entire adult voting life has been watching bad government and watching the Republicans win, even when Democrats have power. 

Trump isn‚Äôt the beginning of something, he‚Äôs the culmination of decades of bad government on Republican terms. He‚Äôs the inevitable endgame of the Republican Party. 

If we can‚Äôt expect Biden to change, then we deserve to lose in 2022 and he deserves to be impeached by the Republicans in 2023. 

Historians in free countries‚Äî which won‚Äôt be ours‚Äî will look back and consider this all to be a progression, not a sudden shift from good government to bad government with the election of Trump.

The election of Trump was the natural reaction to America daring to elect a black man, and you‚Äôd better believe Republicans will burn the country to the ground before they ever see Kamala Harris in the Oval Office. 

We our on borrowed time, a narrow window, and Biden is counting on institutions to save us when they have already failed."
0,"You‚Äôre looking at the whole thing from your own simplistic point of view. You do know republicans became the party of ‚ÄúNO‚Äù under Obama right? They wouldn‚Äôt allow democrats to pass any bills at all. Please don‚Äôt make this about me. Unless you understand that republicans spend their entire terms in congress sabotaging democrats, this conversation is futile. Many republicans came by and went, but Gingrich, Boehner, McConnell and McCarthy have been the worst in modern history. Democrats legislate, republicans on the other hand, spend their entire time resisting democratic legislations without offering any alternatives. Pro-life and white supremacy aren‚Äôt what make the nation move forward. When was the last time republicans introduced any bills for the general welfare? Tax cuts for the wealthy?"
1,"I‚Äôm 100% sure the person living in the fantasy world is you, who for some reason thinks the filibuster is part of the Constitution and will save Dem progress. 

Bless your angry heart."
1,"Anyways, let‚Äôs come back to this conversation in about two and a half years when McConnell ends the filibuster and you act surprised about it. 

It‚Äôll be right around the time they‚Äôre impeaching Biden, just because they can.

Can‚Äôt wait to say I told you so. 

But, sure. The filibuster, man. Totally the savior of American democracy."
0,"Yeah, Moses‚Äô Book of Numbers. I thought you were against abortion and my only point was that republicans keep throwing their anti-abortion stances out there and it‚Äôs apparently based on Christianity, yet they‚Äôre unable to prove which scriptures in the Bible ban it."
0,"This passage from Numbers is always mentioned and always dismissed. Most pro-life people will interpret this as a recipe for causing sterility, not abortion. Either way, pretty disturbing."
0,"In modern history and right after Gingrich, the only time republicans were this extreme was when Obama came in. No one is saying there was never any disagreements between democrats and republicans, it‚Äôs expected and as a matter of fact, it‚Äôs part of the democratic process in which the system of checks and balances is based on and compromise being the ultimate outcome. And yes, Trump did finalize the radicalism of the Republican Party that went directly after the very institutions of the federal government. That‚Äôs not disagreements, it‚Äôs anarchy, sedition and treason. I‚Äôm fully aware of the racist, anti-semitic, homophobic, Islamophobic and sexist agenda of the Republican Party to attend to its confederate base, but it didn‚Äôt amount to an insurrection on the Capitol until Trump came in."
1,"Yea, like 4 years under Trump being the no party. Grow the fuck up and try and understand that you can't do anything that they can't do. Make a new rule, they will show you how to use it. But by all means do what feels good for the moment. Who cares if they use it to pass a national abortion ban in 3 years."
2,"‚ÄúThe only time Republicans were this extreme is when Obama came in.‚Äù 

Sigh. 

You‚Äôre very close to getting it."
0,"‚ÄúMake a new rule, they will show you how to use it.‚Äù 

Guess the Democrats should just continue to play chess with rules according to how Republicans want them as the pigeons shit all over the chess board, then."
0,"You jumped to Obama without paying attention to my comments on Gingrich first. I can go all the back to the very beginning with the founders. Do you want to start to Thomas Jefferson? Because I‚Äôm pretty sure, the crisis we‚Äôre dealing with as of now is due to DJT and his Russian backed QAnon. BTW, I know what the fake Tea Party did. This thread simply isn‚Äôt dealing with that topic. Trump launched a failed coup d‚Äô√©tat, that‚Äôs an attack on the entire United States government."
2,"Continue to follow the fucking constitution, and rules that have stood for a hundred years. Make some new ones, and you better believe they are going to show you how to use them."
0,"And you‚Äôre, for some reason, just forgetting about that whole era when Republicans embraced McCarthyism, or maybe that‚Äôs just good government.

Or when the Republican Party embraced the southern strategy. 

Or when the Republican Party essentially stole the 2000 election. 


Again, the crisis we‚Äôre dealing with now did not start with Trump. 

The insurrection on the Capitol was the inevitable conclusion. 

McCain gave us Sarah Palin. 

Murkowski and Collins and Romney aren‚Äôt the good guys that are going to help us save democracy. 

There are no moderate Republicans, and haven‚Äôt been any moderate Republicans in a long time. 

We‚Äôve had multiple opportunities to stop this crisis from unfolding, it‚Äôs just the Democratic Party, in spite of all evidence to the contrary, continued to at least pretend to believe the GOP was operating in good faith, until the insurrection happened. 

Anyways, I think we‚Äôre both basically in agreement and on the same side. 

I just think our crisis began well before Trump and the insurrection happened."
0,"It‚Äôs fun how you think the Republicans are gonna give a damn about the Constitution when they take back control in 2022.

Anyway, the filibuster wasn‚Äôt originally part of the constitution."
0,"Democrats need to finally learn from the GOP. Judges, nobody gets approved during an election year unless it's Dem appointed PERIOD, NO EXEPTIONS EVER. With the abortion law in Texas, Dems, listen to me, USE THIS PRECIDENCE TO GO AFTER GUNS. In the Dem states, outlaw all firearms and use the people to enforce it. That's the key, if the State isn't enforcing the law, the law can't be challenged, law stands. Come on Dems, I know it's not in your passive nature, but let's get tough, it's time. ""But we don't want to stoop to their level"", grow up and start winning for once"
0,"This is so true. We consistently underestimate the ruthlessness of the GOP, and refuse to take a stand no matter how badly they abuse us."
2,"Going hard left is really a bad idea, you've got a lot if support right now from moderates like me.l"
2,"> Opinion

Fact, actually."
0,"If GOP cheats and lies, then they aren't ""for America"", right?

They should be dismantled for being anti-American, or unconstitutional, or something. They are making a mockery of our country, and Not supporters at all, right?"
2,"So very true.

When your objective is destruction and division your job is  much easier than actually trying to build something."
0,"Universal Healthcare. Abortion Rights. Voting Rights. Climate Change Policies. Are not going hard left. These are basic facts of most if not all major economies. 

In Canada ‚Äúgoing hard left‚Äù is talking about UBI or drug program (already available for 65+) or free dental care. 

‚ÄúModerates‚Äù in the US need to look at how the rest of major economies work."
2,"Standing still and status quo are not providing any results. 


So what else you got?"
0,"There is no such thing as a moderate democrat at this point. A good example is Joe Biden. Joe is now, because the GOP has shifted so far right, basically a 1980's republican. You are either progressive or in the wrong party."
0,"Well‚Ä¶..that‚Äôs what the GOP does. They minimize their failures and maximizes others.

And don‚Äôt say that ‚Äúboth sides are the same‚Äù. This meme is the first I knew about the four killed in Niger."
0,And the twice impeached failed president [stopped going to Dover airforce base to pay respects to the fallen Soldiers](
2,"My headcanon about this is that Sean Spicer convinced him it didn't happen because if he did deliver remarks about it, there was a 100% chance of him mispronouncing 'Niger' on camera."
2,Thanks now I can pass this info on to my Republican Father.
0,"By putting our ally Chad, on the no fly list, trumpy caused the death of these four soldiers. When trumpy did this, Chad immediately pulled their soldiers out if the area. It was the first day going out looking for insurgents without the aid of soldiers from Chad. Why weren't there tons of investigations into this? Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi, though."
0,"So the trouble with the right wing is that nothing is hypocritical to them because the way they think is that as long as it serves their political goals it's right and proper. 

This is so fundamental that they're not capable of true hypocritical thinking because their so backwards that they can't line the two hypocritical thoughts up. 

George Orwell called it ""Double Think"" and it's legit terrifying."
0,Buttery mails! SMH. I hate the GOP
0,"And let's not forget that he had no business being there--apparently it was some kind of favor to Putin, and he sent mercenary soldiers, not Marines, who then left behind the soldiers, including one who was still alive, but then ambushed and mutilated (that's the one whose mother he said ""he knew what he was getting into"" to).   He caused their deaths.   

The even worse hypocrisy was their absolute radio silence on this--Trump literally CAUSING the needless deaths of four American soldiers--after years and years and years of screaming about Benghazi (which was an attack on the US Embassy in a known hotspot, the same as other attacks during the Bush and Reagan presidencies--AND Hillary had requested add'l security, and the GOP had refused it)."
0,"And four Nigerien troops were killed too. 

Also, a typical Trumpian ""Blame Obama"" attack: 

>On 17 October, during a press conference, Trump was asked about his silence by a reporter and commented on the incident. Trump responded by saying that he wrote letters to the families of the victims, and accused his predecessors, specifically President Obama, of not or rarely calling the families of deceased soldiers."
0,The GOP does this because they get away with it every time.
0,"He also got a SEAL killed in his first military action. Crickets.

Edit: and this was *just* off of the Benghazi series of investigations that republicans found nothing actionable with, even after 11 hours of sworn testimony.  Imagine Trump in the same situation."
0,"Well, see, in Trump-world the only deaths that count are not under Republican watch.  The rest of the deaths are jack shit."
2,Never forget who Trump and Republicans really are
0,Well got damit we got a real president now LA David Johnson
2,And both parties are the same?
2,"It was on their way back to the home base when they stopped for water at the village of Tongo Tongo, about 120 miles north of Niger‚Äôs capital. There, the group was ambushed by Islamic State-linked militants armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and small firearms."
0,Don't  forget these soldiers were just losers and suckers according to trump
0,"Don't sign up for the military if you don't want to die. My GF's entire family is republican and they asked my opinion about all these deaths happening with the withdrawal from Afghanistan. 

Why do they all of a sudden care about these deaths when we spent 20 years either being killed or killing people?

Fucking blows my mind the stupid shit these people say."
2,"How many lives did we save by leaving Afghanistan? 
Those 15 that died were heroes and they saved potentially 10‚Äôs of thousands of lives. 
This is why we should be talking about. This should be the headlines. 

Instead the rhetoric from the extreme left and right are ruining our country. There‚Äôs a better perspective out there we just have to try a little harder to empathize with our fellow men. We have to become obsessed with making that happen instead of giving in time the easiness of fighting eAchother."
2,"You have the white house, the house and most of the senate, why would you spread 4 year old nonesense. You need to be saying what your doung to imorove the current situation on like 10 different fronts. Stay current or get out voted. Take some responsibility for once. No one cares aboutbthe finger pointing"
1,These solders didn't die because of an absolute shit show of decision making by the president. Soldiers die in war. period. However what happend in Kabul was entirely preventable and a direct result of Bidens botched withdrawal oppertation.
0,"Remember when we just blew off the Kurds, our allies, leaving them to fend against both Assad and the Turks?  But we are incensed at Biden leaving the the Afghans in Afghanistan after getting over 100,000 of them out?"
0,Any time they say they ‚Äòsupport the troops‚Äô this as well as their hostility towards the VA and veterans homelessness and mental health should be brought up immediately.
0,"To be fair, allowing Trump to pronounce Niger would be a very dangerous request."
0,"Well, they don't necessarily care about Afghanistan either. It's just a political opportunity to blame President Biden."
2,Funny how obsessed with Trump you guys still are lmao
0,Using the deaths of soldiers for political gain is an incredibly low thing to do. Do not sink to the Republicans level.
1,Are you saying it was ok for joe the unicorn to kill 13 service members?
2,"As a vet, I CAN tell you that vets are props for the powerful."
2,I remember. The widow was the woman in Florida who got a phone call from Trump.
0,This was on the news.  The only places where it was censored was on right-wing fake news propaganda.
2,"I mean ... neither the dems or republicans want attention to *what* those soldiers were doing in Africa, who they were killing, or which oil company was paying for it."
2,"Mhmm. Absolutely zero ability to self reflect at all and think ‚Äòhey maybe the way I‚Äôm going about this is wrong or hypocritical?‚Äô

Like the way they think Muslims and other religions are so *obviously* wrong but can‚Äôt apply those same critical thinking skills to their own religion. Like if a Muslim believed just as fervently as a Christian did, don‚Äôt you believe they think their religion is the one true one just like they do?"

0,No. Democrats criticize Biden. They aren't trying to ignore anything just because Trump was worse.
2,Good call. I try to pay attention to whataboutism but sometimes it's easy to miss.
2,How many republicans have attended trump rally‚Äôs after the election he lost.?

Glad I served under a Commander in Chief that I respected."
0,"Okay... but we've been pointing out literally this meme over and over again since like, 2004 at least. 

""No way they could make John Kerry look like a pussy, he was a highly decorated combat veteran while GW was getting high in Texas"" 

""They've said all this stuff about Obama being a Kenyan Muslim who eats dogs, but they'll HAVE to change their tune now that bin Laden is dead""

""No way that Republicans in Kentucky would pick swamp thing Mitch McConnell over a distinguished Air Force pilot with all the funding in the world""

It's like dude, you don't get it... these people could not give less of a shit about ""the troops"" or ""the flag"" and they certainly don't care about being caught up in some technical hypocrisy. They like cruelty, they like the war. They love that violence is being done to people who they dislike, that's all. It's a really simple, yet totally terrifying."
0,"I don‚Äôt know what this means. For 4 years we demanded trump stop talking about all the things he said Hillary did wrong - now Biden wins and we‚Äôre talking about all the things trump did wrong. 

I know it doesn‚Äôt go over well in the Reddit hive mind but Biden won. Trumps out. We need to stop talking about him and hold our current politicians accountable for the good and the bad."
0,"Not sure how  trump blaming Hillary, who was never president, has anything to do with democrats calling out republican hypocrisy. Granted I don't follow Biden‚Äôs press conferences very closely but I can't seem to recall him trump or Pence by name very often at all."
0,"The problem with your position is that it ignores that Trump did everything he could to sabotage Biden. And his appointees have been slowed down. You are aware that Ted Cruz has prevented Biden's State Dept appointees from being confirmed, right?"
0,"This post is focused on the hypocrisy of republicans not the fact that both during Trump and Bidens administration US soldiers died.

Calling everything that calls out hypocrisy ""whataboutism"" is dishonest at best and malicious at worst."
0,"It still occasionally blows my mind, everything else about him aside, that the media acted like it was a big deal that at George Bush's funeral, Trump didn't make it about himself. They acted like it was a big deal that *the president* behaves with the decorum I'd expect from a healthy 5 year old."
1,"I‚Äôm talking about this post - per my prior comments. 

Why are we pulling up how trump behaved? He‚Äôs out. Biden‚Äôs in. Saying ‚Äúreminder - this is his trump behaved‚Äù comes across as saying ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs ok Biden screwed this up because what about trump!‚Äù 

I‚Äôm fine being in the minority on this opinion I just wish the left would stop being so hypocritical."
0,"Come on. It is honestly, literally, ‚Äúwhat about what Trump did, it was way worse‚Äù at least be big enough to admit it. I am And I was saying in 2015, ‚Äúwhat the fuck, Trumpty Dumpty is a freakin sociopath, NO! ‚Äú"
2,"I think you're misinterpreting the ""it's fine Biden screwed up"" aspect, I don't get the impression he's being let off the hook. I can't blame anyone for continuing to highlight the previous administration's shortcomings in comparable situations to what the current one is being held brutally accountable for."
2,"You can interpret it that way if you want but I don't understand it that way. The title calls out the Republican hypocrisy for blasting Biden now while being fine with Trump back in 2017.

By that standard calling out the different reactions to similar situations aka hypocrisy is from now on always ""whataboutism"" and we will no longer be able to call out hypocrisy at all.

Also what is blasted here is neither the situation leading up to the events nor the failures that led to them but rather the reaction to them."
2,"dude isn't this post and entire context just Dems doing the same, i.e blasting trump back in 2017 and being fine with Biden now? You can change the text to ""Your reminder that when four American soldiers were killed in niger in 2017 Dems raised hell"" and title to ""Dems hypocrisy"" and post it on one of the conservative subs and it'll fit right in.

I've experienced political shithousry in other countries but it's on another level in the US, ~~politicians~~ actually more the supporters, of both sides do the same thing when their guy is not in power. They also do the same thing when your guy is in power. When trump was in t_d was all about obama and drone strikes and now all the dem subs are *but trump did worse*."
1,"So what exactly would you call a ‚Äúwhataboutism‚Äù then? It is bringing up a perceived misdeed, of the past, from the opposition, to deflect from the criticism of a current situation. Exactly what this is. Just like when the Trump supporters would bring up Clinton or Obama to avoid addressing things Trump did. (Sure he might‚Äôve said ‚Äúgrab ‚Äòem by the pussy‚Äù but that was just locker room talk. Clinton actually sexually harassed his underlings) Doesn‚Äôt that sound familiar?"
0,"Dunno in which reality you live but while there are certainly die hard democrats who see no fault in what Biden does the amount of worship Trump gets from republicans is on a whole different level.

There is literally a hearing about the Afghanistan withdrawal initiated by democrats about the Afghanistan withdrawal.

Trump instigated a mob to storm the capitol and got much less heat from republicans than Biden now gets from democrats.

 just as an example.

So no. It is not even close on both sides and thinking that both sides do the exact same thing is again either misinformed or just plain dishonest."
0,"Right. I am a lifelong Democrat but I am not so eat up with partisan bullshit that I deny the obvious. When we do it we are pointing out hypocrisy, when they do it they are deflecting. Ok, live the delusion."
2,"It is exactly as you describe it. Whataboutism is bringing up something that you think was worse to make another mistake seem less bad.

I only disagree that this is the intention of this post. The intention is as I read it to make people remember how different republicans REACTED to the things Trump did wrong compared to how they react to Bidens mistakes now.

The huge difference to me is that the title attacks republicans for their hypocrisy and does not focus on whether Trump or Bidens mistakes were worse."
2,"I was never questioning the validity of the complaint, one way or the other. I was simply pointing out that it is the same tactic. Don‚Äôt you understand that the right also believe they are pointing out the hypocrisy of the left when they do it?"
0,Well duh ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre gerrymandering districts and making it difficult for dems to vote.  American democracy at work.
0,"We‚Äôre still in a battle for the soul. If America chooses not to vote blue in 2024 we‚Äôve lost the battle. After all this bullshit it‚Äôs just amazing people can‚Äôt find away to vote. The US wouldn‚Äôt be the first country to slide into fascism. That said, a good sign will be if Newsom wins the recall by a large margin. But look a CA 48th district, after all the crap Democrats don‚Äôt show up to vote."
0,I'm going to say something controversial:  Fani Willis does not think she can find 12 people that would convict Donald Trump.  She knows that there would be jury nullification.  I mean they have Trump on the phone clearly interfering with the Georgia election.  It doesn't matter.  Trump would have enough supporters that would vote not guilty even if they saw him shoot someone on fifth avenue.
2,"Do you not already do that?

It's how I warm up my clicking finger. Hop on YouTube, report hate speech, watch cat videos. Work done well."
0,Fox News has all comments turned off? Are there other ways to find assholes making asshole comments?
0,"It's unlikely to go anywhere unless Tucker starts just using full-on racial epithets.

Most of the mainstream rightwing stuff is careful enough to keep things duplicitous enough for plausible deniability. ""We weren't calling *Mexicans* criminals, we were calling *immigrants* criminals!"" If something is *unambiguously* racist or hate speech, then yeah go ahead and report."
2,"I don‚Äôt want YouTube to censor anything but those shouldn‚Äôt them up on my searches or recommendation unless I use ‚ÄúFox News‚Äù in the search box. YouTube promotes hate videos on my search that‚Äôs my problem, for PR they block bunch of videos but they allow most videos to appear on your searches. Tech companies has to fix the algorithm but they are scared it will affect the user activity on their app."
2,"I‚Äôve just stopped looking at YouTube‚Äôs news channels. The comments, no matter who‚Äôs in office, are full of whining babies I couldn‚Äôt care less about. They need to find something better to do rather than being pathetic losers who talk to the 10,000 other losers also trying to ‚Äòmake an impact?‚Äô about the political situation. I too watch Fox News for comedy. ~~F~~Tucker once started saying we should all identify as the opposite gender to break records and that shit was hilarious."
0,"Well, no shit. All these recounts, and law suits. Now the insurrection. They are doing their best to destroy the country."
2,What exactly does Reich mean when he says Democrats need to wake up? Is he implying that there's reticence towards change and crushing these freaks? Reich is great but I expect a little more than just foot stomping and demanding the magic wand that doesn't exist. The only Democrats need to wake up about is freaking VOTING. The end.
2,They are making it legitimate by filing lawsuits. People follow news but never the actual hearings. US should have spent more on education and critical thinking programs in schools.
0,"Frankly, if Democrats don‚Äôt show up to vote the country will slide into fascism. Look at Texas, Georgia and Florida. That restaurant in Florida that doesn‚Äôt allow Biden voters as patrons should clue people in. You just can‚Äôt expect to not vote and have things fall in your lap."
0,"Republicans have the audacity to speak on accountability. 

Griffith is in the Sedition Caucus and hasn't called for any accountability for any of Trump's actions. He hasn't supported any efforts to hold people accountable for He votes lockstep with his fellow Republicans no matter what is best for his constituents or the country. 

Republicans are trying to keep the focus on the feigned outrage over Afghanistan."

I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm going to focus on our position rather than ‚Äúother guys are bad‚Äù."
2,"

Click on ""Download the Party Platform"" and take a look at ours.

You have to be careful; your state group wants to kind of oversee what literature is put out. Simply because the Dem messaging should be consistent and fact-based. 

Are you working with your county party? Your County Chair should know what to do. Or your Congressional District Chair."
2,"Yes, that's exactly what you want to do. Facts and information about what Dems are doing and want to do.. not all negativity about Rs. 

What state are you in? You should be able to look at your state party platform. See what your party is doing at the state level and integrate that with info relative to your community."
2,Yes I reached out to my county parties chair to ensure we are getting something out. She agreed with my assessment and hadn‚Äôt realized how short we were on any kind of resource for the tables.
2,To be honest I started working not even considering the state or county Dem party could have different So thanks for that idea.
0,No walls... The idea of a border wall is so stupid. Regardless of where you put it. Oregonians  talk about one on our southern border all the time. Lol the Cali's would just come through Nevada. A boycott would be a cheaper solution.
0,Pretty crappy solution for all the Texas Democrats like me that are trying to change things
2,No.  This reminds me too much of my conservative friends talking about doing the same for California or New York.
0,There are some good people in Texas. We can't leave them behind or the Texiban will destroy them.
0,"Better yet:

Let the entire south secede. No war, no guns, no violence. Just paperwork. 

The thing is, no federal money either. 

Let‚Äôs see if the Texas economy is enough to subsidize all those red states without federal supplements.

Hell, they can keep most of the flyover states as well. 

Let‚Äôs just make it the Northeast, the West Coast, and everyone else is all on their own‚Ä¶"
1,I‚Äôm sure all the people of color who live there and in the south would LOVE that. If Northern Dems actually helped out when the South gets gerrymandered rather than letting it slide (like Obama and Holder did) then maybe things wouldn‚Äôt be so shit.
0,We actually need to split the US up again but this time one side fascist the other democrats
0,"I get that this is a joke post, and I‚Äôll have to look for sources to prove this, but the number of dems in the south has been increasing a fair bit recently since the circus of election season."
0,"We aren't as bad as Texas.. Yes half of us are.. Some maybe worse.. But a good half of us are decent. We sometimes go blue like for Obama. 

We have Disney world! And I'm in Tampa with the Bucs, Lightening, and Rays!"
0,"Which would have the effect of kicking out some millions of Latinos and Black Americans, people that tended not to vote for Trump. Hell, Texas is a minority-majority state. You want to abandon your fellow citizens, your fellow Democrats in many cases, rather than fight alongside them? That's not political bravery."
0,They have the 10th largest economy in the world. So they probably would be just fine. And why would you push the Southern democrat states out. The south is why the Dems won the Senate. Georgia baby
2,"Hey Praxis, the Great Lake states want nothing to do with the south, so don't even think about leaving us out."
2,The intellectual basis of the country
2,Texas would be able to self- sustain because of fossil fuels. Rest of the south would go into bankruptcy almost immediately.
0,"Texas isn't even strong enough to sustain itself, let alone subsidize the massively federal-government-dependent red states. Texas came crying to the federal government, begging for federal funds while people were literally freezing to death during their winter storm in February."
2,That‚Äôs exactly what the South wanted to do in the Civil War‚Ä¶. Who would want to secede with a war when you can do it peacefully? So pretty much you‚Äôre saying Lincoln should have let the Union split.
2,That‚Äôs when China Russia seizes the opportunity to attack a divided US
2,"On the one hand, I get the exhaustion of having states that perpetually make life worse for everybody.

On the other, don't say you believe in making things better for everybody while also being okay with people having fascism forced upon them.

If we want to fix shit, we've *got* to fix flyover country.  These people are desperate, and the only people even trying to sell them solutions they understand are doing so in bad faith.  It's why ""reopening the coal mines"" sells so well in West Virginia and Pennsylvania.  It's why trade protectionism plays well in Ohio and Michigan.  They think that imports cost them their jobs, and that coal demand is down because bad people have tried to undermine them--not that coal is simply not worth much anymore.

There are entire regions that have been destroyed economically because the economic viability of their core industries is gone, never to return--but the people who live there don't want to move on."
2,"They can emigrate to the new USA, their choice"
0,"If we can keep making major political gains in Texas and Georgia, then maybe it‚Äôd be worth staying on‚Ä¶

BTW, my previous post was (mostly) tongue-in-cheek. ;-)

I don‚Äôt actually want to split the nation, but it gets incredibly frustrating when Texas touts their strong, independent cowboy spirit until it all goes wrong (and they come crying for help), and the southern and flyover blocks claim to be true patriots fighting against all welfare and handouts, yet they eat up way more federal funds than they contribute in taxes. 

They simply don‚Äôt get to have it both ways anymore. 

If there‚Äôs one thing the last 18 months has taught us all, it‚Äôs that this level of cultural stupidity has deadly consequences‚Ä¶"

0,"because moving to another country, a country where you might not have family or friends, is so cheap and easy. the women most effected by anti-abortion laws would be the ones who don't have the money to not get around them. by allowing the South to secede you would only make this problem 10 times worse. if someone can't afford to travel across state lines for a few days to get an abortion if necessary, they probably can't afford to move across international borders."
2,Louisiana has a Dem running the state. The Clinton's came out of Arkansas.
2,What about the fossil fuel subsidies?
2,"Of course they can survive. What interest would the US have in creating a new hostile nation along one of its borders?
You think a nice peaceful split with no issues over land will happen? What if the South wants Virginia or Missouri? What if deep red Indiana wants to join? I‚Äôm sure Idaho, Wyoming and Utah and going to want in on the action. What states would the US give up to let them have one connected body of land?"
2,"I understand what you're saying, my point is, like Afganistan, the people of Texas can make changes if they want to. The Afganis had a 300,000 man army and a Govt in place, they let a crazy minority control them, thats why we left, they can't be helped. They won't stand up for their rights. Same with the people of Texas, if the people don't stand up and fight for themselves, then we should allow Texas to leave the US. Its the same principal"
0,"Anyways, it‚Äôs helpful if you understand and accept that the Republican Party isn‚Äôt interested in democracy, or free and fair elections."
2,"lol. 

Yes, the Clintons came out of Arkansas in 1990. I fail to see how that is at all relevant to 2021. 

North Carolina has a Dem Governor too. 

Doesn‚Äôt much matter. 

They‚Äôre not going to let democrats take a southern state in a presidential year, ever again."
0,"Yep, kill those too.

Why the hell should we subsidize one of the most profitable and environmentally-damaging industries on the planet?"
0,"I'm sure we could figure something out.

While the North would lose access to the gulf and most of the Mississippi River, we would still have the Atlantic,  the Great Lakes and hopefully a Pacific land bridge from California to the Great Lakes.

Without blue state taxpayer dollars, consumers and tourists, the South's economy would wither on the vine."
0,"See flyover states referenced above‚Ä¶

Many of these states are barely hanging on with federal funds subsidized from the strong blue economies. 

Leave those blue funds to help only blue states, and the reds will crumble even faster than they‚Äôre doing now‚Ä¶

Watch the next year or so as Biden‚Äôs infrastructure bill starts pumping millions into local economies, and the red states gladly take all that money while unironically calling him sleepy and ineffective and continuing to vote against their own best interests‚Ä¶"
2,It's relevant because the people that voted for them are still there. They didn't follow Bill to DC. Or Hillary to New York. In theory of course. The last time the country split and the south succeeded from the union. The republican party was born under Abe.
1,I guess‚Ä¶ collectively they would still be a more resource rich country with a higher GDP than most countries in the world including in Europe because of Texas and Florida
2,"> Many of these states are barely hanging on with federal funds subsidized from the strong blue economies.

0,"I see what you are saying and agree with you about not abandoning the Dems who still live in those states. 

But the Republican Party is, in no way, the Party of Abraham Lincoln any longer. 

They literally worship at the altar of confederate statues. 

They are the Party of Trump. 

If Lincoln were alive today, he would‚Äôve criticized Trump and they would‚Äôve called him a traitor. 

I think we‚Äôre either going to have an authoritarian government by 2030, or civil war."

0,We shall see. It does seem to be getting worse. Hopefully the trump colt will be gone soon. I'm assuming some of them are decent people who drank the Kool aid. It's like a bad movie
0,"That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm talking about - the federal funds are spent federally, not (mostly) distributed as budget transfers. They‚Äôre spent on the federal social safety net, ie Medicare Medicaid and social security.

That‚Äôs not an economic subsidy. It‚Äôs federal programs that every American pays into and every American is entitled to draw from. The alternative is that an American worker is less worthy of social security (as a concept) based on where they live, which is stupid frankly. 

Happy to link the Rockefeller institutes research on this topic, which shows exactly what you would expect‚Ä¶ that a map of federal spending per capita is identical to a map of per capita elderly Americans, poverty, and disability rates. With some outliers like Virginia having a large amount of federal offices of course, and New Mexico with federal labs."

0,"Now all pregnant women should be allowed to use the carpool lanes in Texas, right?"
0,It‚Äôs not a bad idea tbh. And I would go a step further and say if the woman decides to not put the child up for adoption then the man has to pay 50% of child costs for 18 years and if he can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt he should be sent to federal prison for 18 years instead. No chance of parole
0,"Age should also be measured starting at conception, then. Birthdays are now Conception Days. All human rights apply at six weeks of age. Men who beat their wives or otherwise induce miscarriage will be persecuted for first degree manslaughter in addition to domestic violence charges. Half of all medical costs paid by the father begins at six weeks. They will need to be added to health care coverage plans as well. No need for birth certificates there will now be Conception Identification with only a number until other information is obtained. Can a person legally not have a name? If not- you must be named as soon as conception is confirmed. As a zygote is now *life* a new *possible life* will likely be recognized. As such, male masturbation will be closely monitored and prohibited as it does not occur without external stimulation. Sex without procreative intent will be discouraged and you can bet birth control will be next to go. Any age restricted right will be measured from conception, obviously. The definition of life will need revision. Basic science and the seven characteristics of life no longer apply. So many nonliving things just became living. I‚Äôm not sure about this one but if the pregnancy or childbirth kills the mother doesn‚Äôt that make the person responsible the fetus? How would that work? Anyways- point is this whole idea is a stupid front for punishing and controlling women. You can bet that the rich will be getting abortions for their wives and the other poor women they knock up. Look- if I get raped and pregnant I‚Äôm gonna get put in prison for the abortion anyway so might as well shoot the rapist in the face just sayin."

Haven‚Äôt we all learned yet that normal rules and precedent and the constitution no longer apply?

0,"The whole concept needs rebranding. ""Critical race theory"" is true American history. We Caucasians have a lot of blood on our hands. Teachers might do well to abandon that label and lose the thought that they are creating revolutionaries and stick to the facts: we stole and abused countless humans, and taught our children to hate and oppress said humans based on the color of their skin, and it took us more than two and a half centuries to begin to address the legacy of violence and hatred we created. Those are facts. 

That, and many of our most notable white inventors were likely to have been on the autism spectrum: Einstein, Tesla, even Jefferson.  If some of the newly minted eductors would ditch the inflammatory rhetoric, quit giving bonus points for protest attendance, stuck to the grim truths of American history, and taught critical thinking instead of trying to piss people off, this country might get somewhere.

The problem we have here is ignorant people trying to change the way we teach history and using CRT as the boogeyman to try to make that happen. They are fascists and like all good fascists, they see the schools as propaganda machines, not educational institutions. So they use scary words to make their followers believe something is wrong and shouldn't be taught.

Secondly, it's not right to pass the responsibility of a previous generation's actions onto the next.  No one should feel guilt or shame just because of the color of their skin.

You seem to deny white privilege. Is that correct?

1,"He's right though,  saying white people have blood on their hands because  the actions of people in the past or some people in the present is as racist as assuming black people as a group are responsible for the few black people who commit a disproportionate amount of violent crime, or blaming men for the few who commit a disproportionate amount of rape.

And white privilege  might exist, but the overly simplified heuristic that is used when discussing white privilege deeply flawed. One can't assume that just because  someone is white, they are automatically  privileged. There are so many many variables involved that may increase, decrease, or nullify any actual  privilege that just talking about it in such broad terms of all white people compared to all minorities as privileged or oppressed is completely useless and ultimately causes more conflict than help resolve anything."

2,"The view you hold of white privilege is one I held for a long time.  What it isn't saying is that white people have easy lives or no problems or an automatically easier life than people of color.  Unfortunately, that's how some people talk about it.

I grew up white in a small, poor, rural, farming town.  Lots of meth, lots of poverty, things were bad.  There was a lot of resentment to the idea of white privilege because, as you say, there are lots of levers and dials on how privileged someone is.  

White privilege is the truth that, if one of those people were black, their life would be harder and they would have to deal with more issues than they do currently.  It ISN'T taking away or minimizing what those people are going through.  It is acknowledging race is one of the bigger levers in the equation."

2,"Cryptocurrencies have no legal basis.  The Constitution places sole authority over currency in Congress - not in Elon Musk, not in some mysterious Japanese man with his Chinese coin mining facility. 

Do you even know why we have devaluation in the dollar?  Do you know how fiat currency actually works and the global coordination of currency markets?  

We had moderate to mild inflation for several decades until Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1970, which crashed the economy throughout the 70s.  Yet, we still managed to have no carry over debt for programs - even Vietnam.  But in the 70s, we started borrowing money like crazy from Japan, to the point where  a minister of education suggested we cede Hawaii to them in exchange for writing off the debt. 

Carter used monetarism to increase inflation significantly which lowered the value of the dollar to repay the Japanese their dollar indexed funds.  This decrease the amount we owed them by billions of dollars.  Yes, stagflation: double digit interest rates, double digit inflation and double digit unemployment.  Short term pain (like 8 years) for long term gain of not carrying foreign debt. 

But Congress couldn't control its spending, and decided to leverage the funds in social security instead.  Throughout the 80s and 90s that's where we borrowed from thus increasing the total debt.  Various members of Congress then opined mightily about the impending crash of Social Security and that it should be privatized, like Chile did.  Except, Chile's program crashed and burned. 

We've been borrowing money for 40 years.   Mysterious, uncontrolled digital currency won't change anything other than create yet another ponzi scheme where the people who get in first, profit and the people who get in late lose money.   With no transparency and no accountability - that's what crypto is: it's a Ponzi scheme."

Just because some people use it criminally does not make it inherently bad for the overall financial system. People money launder, commit fraud and cheat at the stock market all the time using USD fiat.

What Ultimately will help people who are pro crypto vote for a specific political party is where their stance on crypto is."

2,"Firstly, I want to say thank you for being kind and respectful. I knew this post would be met with ire and aggressiveness. 

But to your point of backing, our current USD isn't backed by anything other than the trust and psychological agreedness that it equals x amount. Money is an arbitrary meaning just like lines in the dirt mean that a country, ""exists"" there. Granted, symbolism is EXTREMELY valuable. Symbolism has been used for great evil and great good. 

My point ultimately is, doomsayers leave room for others to take up the mantle as champions of the crypto space."
2,"That actually isn't correct.  The dollar is backed by the US Government.   It's fiat around the world with more than 20 countries that use it as their currency. 

As one of the dominant currencies in global currency baskets, mismoves by Congress or the Federal Reserve can have catastrophic global consequences.    

About crypto?  Who owns it?  Who oversees it?  Nobody  We see Elon Musk quite reliably pumping Dogecoin with a few weeks at the end of his fiscal quarter, and then dumping it a week after the books close.  

Bitcoin is heavily used by terrorists around the world for ransomware.  The mythical value is the anonymity, yet governments are showing success at seizing wallets used for crime.    Speaking of criminal terrorists, North Korea is one of the leading countries that use crypto for criminal activity.

If you lose all value in your crypto, the way it has happened to many people - who do you deal with to get partial indemnification or a refund?

Nobody.  Nobody.  This is exactly the model that caused multiple financial collapses in the United States from 1830 through 1880.  Five complete financial collapse, bank runs and depressions that lasted for years. 

Because of these collapses, we created the Federal Reserve to oversee currency and debt.  The closest we've come to a collapse was 2008 because of speculative investments.  Sound familiar?  That cost us more than $1 trillion to bring under control.

We have the FDC which exists to oversee financial institutions to protect consumers in the event of a collapse.  No crypto is FDC backed, meaning - a collapse in any crypto leaves it's investors without recourse, and no government backing means they'll never see a cent of it again.

That's why we don't support crypto  It's the subprime mortgage of financial instruments."
2,"My point exactly, USD is backed by the conglomerate agreedness that the US government will catch us if we fall. Just because USD is backed by the government doesn't make it's value any less psychological. 

If I say, my rock is more valuable because 1000 people find it valuable, does it make it any more valuable than the 500 people who think their rock has more value? Inherently no, because they both have psychological value not actually valuable. 

People made the same argument when we made the move away from gold backed USD. A new medium of exchange is necessary for a global economy to evolve. Using the empire of the United states of America as a basis for a financial system globally won't work forever."
2,"Unfortunately this is typical absolutism. The USD is run through every world nation and backed by 20 governments and trillions of dollars, and losses can be compensated.

Crypto *runs* based on wide psychological trust which you try to present as similar, but the scale is not even close. Further, Crypto is not backed by anybody. Lost wallets are not redeemed, stolen data, fraudulent exchanges can not be fought. When Bitcoin had its big early pop and exchanges promised to refund you in their shop's virtual currency rather than dollars, there was nothing you could do."

Having been involved with local democratic politics throughout my teens and early adulthood (I've had to stop since it's considered a conflict of interest with my current job) I can assure you, the people showing up are not always the people we want writing the party platform.  Most the people showing up have big financial interests in getting certain things done.  If we want democracy to work, we need to be more active in it.

2.  Vote in every election, especially at the local level.  The local level has huge influence on your day to day life, your vote carries more weight at the local level, and our next national level candidates have to get their start somewhere.  Voting in every election also means doing your homework.  Get to know the candidates.  For my most recent state delegate primary, I had a chance to talk with both the individuals on the ballot and got a solid feel for both.  It was clear the less funded guy was better to me, but he lost pretty decisively.  So few people do the homework so the woman with the slick mailers won.

3.  Run yourself.  As I already said, democracy only works if we work it.  If the people running aren't getting the job done, then someone else needs to step up.  And frankly, I'd rather vote for the reluctant candidate running to do the right thing than the person who really wants power.  I'm afraid of people who want power.

2,"Both parties could have removed the filibuster many times. Neither did because of the concerns it raises when they are now in power.

I'm unconvinced they will, but if Dems remove it, they will overrun them entirely when they next have a slim majority."
2,"What stops an out of state telemedicine company simply posting the pills to somebody who wants an abortion? 

I wonder if there's going to be a big black-market for abortion medication."
2,Okay but my senators are already voting yes. I don't even know when the vote is being held.
2,"It‚Äôs not just Reddit, it‚Äôs all over the rest of social media and regular news too. No one seems to be telling the whole story here, just sensational outrage."
0,Packing the courts will lead to unfucking the courts
2,"I think Democrats have good intentions, but they're too timid and want to be on good terms. But the GOP will steamroll over stuff, which leaves Dems with their pants down."
1,Democratic leaders are doing that on their own. Don‚Äôt blame anyone else.
2,"The number of new justices needs to be even, to keep the total odd.

I have no remaining confidence that I can predict why someone would win the presidential election, just the same as I no longer understand what we're disagreeing over or where the center line is."
1,So Democrats are on board with Christo-fascism or is this about the so-called ‚Äòmoderates‚Äô and independents? I say fck ‚Äòem. This shit is dead serious. They get re-elected to a fascist country that‚Äôs about to do away with elections? Seems like a shortsighted take.
0,"You don't recognize the fascists. Sweep them all under the Republican label and you neuter their worst tendencies. 

Independents should have disproportionate representation in an non-partisan court system that is designed to be the arbiter of constitutional, or unconstitutional laws across the land"
0,"I don‚Äôt see it, I meant to say I don‚Äôt like people who are sexual assaulters approving laws that affect sexual assaulters.

Edit: I think I see it."
0,"‚Äú I hate sexual assaulted approving laws that affect sexual assaulters‚Äù implying that these judges were assaulted, and not the assaulters them selves."
1,"Criticizing Biden is a bad thing? How is that something to be mad about? He's made mistakes in the past, he's not perfect, I don't agree with all his positions. 

And just so you know, he was criticized for it back then."
2,"Maybe, but I critique Biden and I'm a supporter. It's healthy to disagree ‚ò∫Ô∏è n reasonable grounds."
0,"Why is criticism of Biden off limits. The man has made a lot of wrong choices in his career. No one is perfect, and the fact that the African American community was split on Thomas is irrelevant. 

Let‚Äôs just hope that Biden makes the right decision now and gets behind the movement to expand the court."
2,This is America- we still get to criticize our electeds
2,Did you sleep through the entire Trump administration? They've already done it.
2,"They refused to even confirm Obama's judges, but when Trump came, they approved judges with a rubber stamp."
2,"Because they didn't need to in order to pack the courts in their favor.  All they had to do was refuse to vote on Obama's elected judges, so they could give them to Trump.

If they'd needed to expand the courts to get them packed, they wouldn't have hesitated."
2,Call senator Sinema at 202-224-4521 and senator Manchin at 202-224-3954
2,"We have to make it happen. The supreme court was willed into existence extra-constitutionally. We can will it into anything we want with the correct votes. Notably, this will not happen with either party in power pushing their own agenda. It has to be done when the court is evenly split"
2,"Yeah. It seems the party wants to ‚Äúwin‚Äù on their terms, only in certain ways they feel is appeasing. It is not good enough to win, they want to win while looking good and having broad communal support and that is simply not possible.

I see it in uber colleagues all the time. They want to win while feeling superior."
2,Haven‚Äôt heard a single ‚Äúdemocratic leader‚Äù say the shit you‚Äôre saying.
2,No I'm with you. That was my cynicism speaking before. I mean I just can't think of any reason why the dems wouldn't fill the court with judges when they have complete control if not for their own worry over re-election... To yeah get the moderate and independant votes.
2,You missed the point of the example. If any party loses support and dies due to radicalism they still have huge representation in the court under your proposal.
0,I quite like Biden and I think you‚Äôre completely right. We‚Äôre not trump supporters who look at the president and think he‚Äôs gods gift to our cause. He‚Äôs a human and he makes mistakes. Hell Anita Hill herself endorsed him in the last election despite everything that happened back then.
0,"Just so you know, the African-American community was split on the Clarence Thomas nomination. Of course, you didn't mention that Biden and the other Democrats were caught in a difficult situation. You pretend Biden acted unilaterally and alone. Your goal is obvious: to casually smear Joe Biden."
0,"Too bad your claim wasn't reasonable, huh? Odd how you failed to mention that the African-American community was split on the Thomas nomination, huh?

But then your goal was to blame Biden. Mentioning the pressure put on him by African-American men wouldn't serve your purpose, would it?"
1,">Why is criticism of Biden off limits. 

Smears are not criticism. Nice try."
2,"It's not, but I don't exactly see why we need to bring up Biden's role in the Thomas nomination every time we point out what a shit head Thomas is.  It's like we're desperately trying to advance the both sides narrative.  Thomas is objectively worse than Biden in almost every conceivable way, and while Biden has gone on since those hearings to do good things, Thomas has been a thorn in the side of democracy, justice and basic human decency ever since.  

I see no value in flogging Biden at every opportunity for what he did 30 years ago."
2,Your proposal would make congress more extreme on both sides. I don't think it's a good idea.
0,"We're talking about expanding the number of judges. I'm unconvinced Republicans would do that.

They are definitely immoral enough to have coerced Kennedy into retirement with something about his son, though. And they are unamerican enough to not hold a vote on Gorsuch."
2,"That's a valid point, but one where we want to expand the war to blowing out the Supreme Court each time there's a party switch?"
0,"I'm actually not convinced of that very last point, but that they practically packed it by not reviewing Gorsuch I do agree. 

I had never seen something so deeply unamerican in my life to that point."
0,"Of course Democrats want to ""win"", that's the whole job of a party and lawmakers. But they need to be strong, and stop pretending the GOP is there to help in good faith."
0,Because they haven‚Äôt said shit. They allow Conservatives to continue their bullshit unchecked. We don‚Äôt stand a chance because they‚Äôve allowed the wrong people to put pieces in place which allow them to continue spreading lies and stealing and rigging elections. Just like Georgia.
2,"People hold ideas, they don't die with parties. They die on their own.

If a new party replaces an old one, they would simply take over that share of the court"
0,"Trump supporters think we like Biden, no matter what, and he's our god. While they can't even look 5 inches from their face to see they worship Trump the same way.

I don't think he's perfect, and I don't want to worship him because I think acting like that towards a politician is just dumb IMO. But I like him for his decency, tolerance and his policies. 

If you watch Last Week Tonight, I highly recommend watching John's interview with Anita Hill."
2,Definition of smear: ‚Äúdamage the reputation of (someone) by false accusations; slander.‚Äù
0,"Let‚Äôs see if he makes the right choice this time. Like I said, I would hope that he has the guts to take a stance and get behind the push for expanding the court. This Supreme Court is completely broken. It‚Äôs a bunch of crazy right wingers with an agenda to undo all of the progress that has been made in the last 100 years. The filibuster is already going to be the reason the dems will loose seats in 2022, and McConnell would have already gotten rid of it if the dems were doing the same thing. In my opinion Biden and the rest of the conservative dems need to grow a pair and get things done, or we are going to loose the country."
0,">no one WANTED Biden to be nominated.

Get off reddit and go touch some grass. Millions of people voted for him in the primaries because they wanted and trusted Biden. Millions more than any other candidate running against him, including Bernie. It wasn't even close."
0,">We're talking about expanding the number of judges. I'm unconvinced Republicans would do that.

Then you aren't paying attention. ""If conservatives become convinced that they cannot win democratically, they will not abandon conservatism. They will reject democracy.‚Äù"
0,"I think Dems may have to fight fire with fire, and adopt the tactics the GOP uses at this point."
2,You said nothing about proportional representation that would allow such a thing
2,"You should talk to normal people offline instead of forming your views on what most people want through the internet lmao

Nothing richer than terminally online people presuming they're the norm in society."
2,McCarthy thinks Barr is still there.
2,"They were blaming speaker Pelosi for the riots as well. Apparently because of security lapses, though IIRC she does not have much role in that."
2,"Unfortunately, repeated lies are believed.  We need to hammer with a clear, concise message.  

And possibly spread some fun lies of our own"
0,With McCarthy. Didn't we already have one dumb congressman named McCarthy already. There should be a law....
2,Even Bill Barr called the riot outrageous and a betrayal of Trumps office. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact Bill Barr is a Corrupt piece of shit.
0,"The GOP really is Schrodinger's douchebag.

It was peaceful protest..! But Nancy Pelosi failed to stop the violent mob.

It's a fake virus..! But the Chinese created it. 

It's a fake vaccine..! But  thankfully Trump invented it. to all conservative talking points."
2,"Obviously.  Too many people fall for optics over substance.


None of the previous administrations had the spine to end the war."
2,The tribal way of life in Afghanistan won.  We tried to force democracy and our beliefs on them for 20 years.  Kabul is the capital and largest city of Afghanistan. They couldn't convince the rest of the country to adopt a whole new world.  The country is tribal and Islam¬†is the official religion of Afghanistan. That never changed.
1,"Someone needs to tell the Afghans freedom isn‚Äôt free. They ought to earn their own freedom through hardship, fight and sacrifice."
2,"You‚Äôre absolutely right. The reality in Afghanistan never changed. Both Karzai and Ghani have spent a large amount of the foreign aid to bribe tribal leaders or face their armed resistance. That‚Äôs the way Afghanistan runs, plain and simple. Obama should‚Äôve left right after Bin Laden was eliminated and disregard Bush‚Äôs rebuilding mission that wasn‚Äôt the reason why we went there in the first place. Democracy is something nations have to fully understand and embrace or it‚Äôll fail. The struggle in Rome after the assassination of Julius Caesar boiled down to pro-monarchy versus the supporters of the Republic. Democracy is an everlasting struggle that every generation must fight for."
0,">The American right has been drunk on its freedom from two kinds of   
inhibition since Donald Trump appeared to guide them into the promised   
land of their unleashed ids. One is the inhibition from lies, the other   
from violence. Both are ways members of civil society normally limit   
their own actions out of respect for the rights of others and the   
collective good. Those already strained limits have snapped for leading   
Republican figures, from Tucker Carlson on Fox News to Ted Cruz in the   
Senate and for their followers.

Just the opening paragraph should motivate EVERY progressive and independent to turn out and vote in EVERY election from now till EVERY last Republican't in EVERY publicly held office is voted out!"
0,"As long as the rest of us do more than point and laugh on election day...Center, Independent, Greens, Liberals, Democrats all have to put some skin in the game and limit the party that clearly does not care about the fundamental principles of democracy out of elected office in Washington and state legislatures."
2,And they will be successful.... UNLESS the Democratic legislatures pass a voting rights act.
0,"Just so we're all clear though, fascism has taken over the Republican party.  This the wet dream of the Koch brothers who have been working on this since the 1950's."
0,"Vote NO on the Republican Recall. Deadline to submit ballots via US Mail or dropbox is Sept 14, Election Day.

This is not a wide-margin win. I worked on Newsom's volunteer text campaign, and I had people threatening to hurt me and hang the Governor.

Please, you need to vote, Californians. If the most blue state in the nation turns red, we are in for some bad shit in terms of public health and recovery measures for the 99%.

Vote. It takes 5 minutes, but changes everything."
0,"We've got to vote no and then change this stupid system. You want to recall a governor, the Lt. Governor steps in. F**k this ""win with 7% of the vote"" s**t. 

&x200B;

imho"
0,"Would it be neat to have another Alex Padilla or Kamala Harris instead of Feinstein? Sure.

But guess what? We got Feinstein and everyone needs to grasp that this is a great thing.

Elder will not only give senate control to Republicans, but he will give us another Cruz, Rubio, Paul or *worse*.

People my not be Feinstein fans but the alternative is a piece of shit Republican.

If people really crave change, keep your dick in your pants and prepare for next year's election.

If change to you is just burning it all down, then fuck you, specifically.

Just vote no."
0,"He's gonna do a whitey take over with the San Diego, Fresno, Bakersfield and rural Northern Areas imposing their authority and suspending the Constitution so they can rape the society."
0,Vote no people. Seriously. No more nut job Republicans.
2,"How does he replace her? 

She‚Äôs not due for election until 2024. 

Unless she dies or resigns isn‚Äôt the seat safe?"
0,"Yes, our time to enact change falls in primary seasons, the general usually ends up fending off whatever shitbag candidate that Rs trot out. It's unfortunate but pragmatic."
2,"Diane Feinstein being re-elected makes me question Dems in California.  She is obviously, and publicly, suffering from dementia.  I don‚Äôt get it, of course she would be a target for this recall crap."
0,Why do the MAGAts always accuse old people of having dementia? Do they think every old person is like Trump and Reagan?
2,"Because they can‚Äôt. The Democratic Party has been neutered by the right wing so that if they enact anything, it‚Äôs seen as/ on muh rights‚Äù. I mean, you should see what some of the spin doctors on the other side are doing."
2,"Because we want to make the world better, not just be assholes about stuff?"
1,"Democrats are, collectively, wimps. We hardly ever push back in any meaningful way."
2,"I agree. Democrats are constantly on their back foot. Democrats are like look at the data, look at the facts, we can save / help / enhance / invest in _______. And that‚Äôll help 90% of Americans. Republicans can drop a meme about Venezuela and socialism and rally 50% of the electorate. Republicans now days appeal to fear of the other, nostalgia, and the base tendencies of their base. Their wins are supported by the remnants of the ‚Äògood Republican‚Äô. 

Don‚Äôt expect anything to get better. Don‚Äôt expect a splinter party of traditional Republicans to emerge in a meaningful way and get the rank and file to ‚Äòcome to their senses‚Äô. 

The future is a dysfunctional, dystopian mess. Crappy roads, crumbling schools, bigger prisons, the endemic presence of Covid-19, and fewer rights for women and minorities. 

We‚Äôre watching the Handmade‚Äôs Tale emerge in front of us. Register to vote and show up on Election Day and vote. Make sure that you get your friends to vote!"
2,"I agree, we need aggression and anger in the DNC, but its not in the DNA of most Dems, that's why they're Dems. I'd have an actual reading of the 2nd Amendment. It says you need to be a member of a WELL REGULATED MILITIA to own a gun. Its incredibly Clear. Come on Dems, grow a set and hit back"
0,The founding fathers had modern day republikkklans in mind when they wrote the second amendment.
1,Also says the right of the people to keep and bear arms.
0,"2nd Amendment lovers only read the last phrase, they dont read the whole Amendment in context"
0,"Read the whole thing, no periods, all part of the same thought, right of the people to keep and bear arms isn't its own amendment"
1,I have. It's my right to keep and bear arms. Don't like guns? Don't buy one! Don't like abortion? Don't get one! Don't like gay marriage? Marry the opposite sex! Problems solved!
2,"BTW, take it to the Supreme Court and let them know."
1,"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
0,"It was written because the people were the military then, called ""minute men"", they needed to be armed because they were the military"

2,"It is, a NY case I believe, with the court the way it is, yeah, a lot of luck, lol"
0,"There's been a few challenges to the Supreme Court, all have failed. Republikkklans don't like me, I have guns and I'm not like them, I hate them. I like it that way."
0,"Republicans love big government. They say they don‚Äôt, but just look at the way they inflate the government to influence their agenda. From corporate welfare to civil right restrictions to preventing cities to pass their own mask mandates, they‚Äôre all over it."
2,"Republicans are one issue voters.

You seem to be more complex than that.

Being called a Democrat in Republican land is a burden, so you don't need to go by that label if it's uncomfortable.

But i can tell you this, you aren't a Republican."
2,It's my observation that people assume the political perspectives of their friends and neighbors.. people are surrounded by Cons? They vote Con..
0,"Republicans want weak government with respect to business i.e. no regulation, unlimited pollution, no worker protections. On the other hand they want strong government with respect to people; so death penalty, control what woman can do, no prevention of police brutality etc."
2,I‚Äôd love for you to make this exact same post in the Republican forum.  Get back to us with a summary of their responses.  Should be entertaining.
0,"Given your support for labor unions, regulatory bodies to look out for consumers and helping disadvantaged people, I'd say you lean Democratic."
0,"- you are so mistaken in what republicans are, they LOVE BIG GOVT and massive deficits and taxcuts that lead to record debt,"
0,The US is a two party system and the ideologies have changed over time. At the moment however republicans represent white supremacy and the fear that their power is declining. This ideology is not justifiable in any working society and you see this played out over and over. So to be a democrat at this moment means against that. Unfortunately that is the stark reality.
2,"In my opinion we are all independents. Dem or Republican are labels for the politicians. I like some ideas from both sides or at least I used to. Republicans like to control spending which I agree with. Only I think that spending control should all go toward the defense budget which gop loves to over inflate. 

From the things you said you liked, you are def more Democrat as Republicans actively want all those to go away.they hate unions. Hate regulations. Hate employee protections. Want no min wage. Want no osha. Want people working more hours and less days off. Democrats don't like big govt they think the govt should be there to help people when they need it and protect people when they can. Gop uses that to con people into saying dems want to control our lives. Which is what they want to do while claiming they are getting govt off people backs. Whatever that means. They want high taxes for the middle and lower class and no taxes for the rich. And they are almost all rich themselves while the Democrats have alot of ppl that were part of the working class before getting elected."
