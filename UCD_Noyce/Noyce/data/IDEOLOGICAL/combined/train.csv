2,"Thank you. So important to not let our like of other aspects of a person (policies, etc.) prevent us from holding them accountable to harms they‚Äôve caused."
2,"Although I agree Gov. Cuomo's behavior seemed inappropriate at times & probably is best if he stepped down, don't think of the accounts I've heard that anything was criminal or against the law. Maybe he will find some other work as he seems like a very decent man. Hoping the new governor Kathy Hochul will do good for the great state of New York."
0,"They elected a man who said he grabbed them by the p***y‚Ä¶.yeah, we have a long way to go."
2,I still say he made trump look bad during the first Covid and he's getting payback. I notice that women always believe women. I'm not convinced this time. I think she's (the one all over tv) is collecting a big paycheck. Just my humble opinion.
0,"Well said, the ""lack of transparency"", there is nothing worse than to be blindsided by a system that you trust. It should be a 2 way window with our government and it's; our officials, that we as citizens have elected to speak our voice, on our terms, our agreed terms as citizens. Thank you for your efforts, AOC all the way!"
0,Cuomo - give me a break - the line has moved! Only for you. We women have stood strong for so long along a line that you determined fit your needs. Your line is leading you out the door of the Governor‚Äôs mansion and office!!
2,We should also not elect abusers to become president
0,"Trump should have resigned also. Yet his supporters, wealthy white men could not let that happen. Side note, I am truly sorry for the abuse you are enduring from those around you. I bless the path you are on, and admire your perseverance in the face of assault. Be safe. Your life is too precious."
2,"Sometimes people don‚Äôt tell the truth, and that‚Äôs okay to admit as well. This abuser vs. abused binary is divisive and leaves 0 room for nuance. Sometimes trauma makes us believe something is happening that isn‚Äôt actually happening. That‚Äôs called psychic equivalence, and it‚Äôs a real thing, and it is not victim-blaming.
And no, that‚Äôs not the case all the time, but it does happen ‚Ä¶ a lot. We are entirely abandoning reality with these victim axioms as if there is no way on earth that there‚Äôs another side to things. THAT is just as well the first step toward totalitarianism
."
0,"I was so worried about how you would handle this. Need to clarify that you have no real responsibility to be vocal about business that‚Äôs not your own however as a political (really in career only‚Ä¶. And I mean that as a compliment) you have been and frequently do voice yourself opinions‚Ä¶. A lot, if not all, are not lunacy and I agree with. But as a fellow Democrat I worried you would stay silent, thank you for being unbiased by party. You are a shining example of how to be a public servant"
0,"And people wonder why victims don‚Äôt report right away. The response is so often that they are lying, don‚Äôt know how social interaction works, or were asking for the abuse. Can we stop allowing these powerful men to defend themselves on national television in this pathetic and manipulative way?"
2,"Biden said Cuomo did a hell of a job, except personally. There's the way Cuomo governed and another way he acted in a purely personal capacity that had nothing to do with being governor. And ""Our American Cousin"" was a hell of a play and a fine presentation by Ford's theater until John Wilkes Booth interrupted it halfway through. Patrons never even got their money back. And that's what's so sad, as Biden noted."
0,How about trump and Gaetz and Kavanaugh? Why are they not held accountable!?
1,We live in a hypocritical society where we rant against the police for treating certain POC as being guilty before facing justice of his or her peers in the court of law.. Are all not innocent until proven guilty in a court of law?
2,"Very well said. You are a true hero, not only to the district you represent, but also for all people that deserve better. We need more like you in our government. Get it, Queen."
0,"I agree fully, but why are only Democrats held accountable for their actions?"
0,Thank you. The sexual violence and abuse by powerful men can no longer be ignored.
0,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unrelated I know.
I‚Äôm from the UK and haven‚Äôt heard any official speak about what‚Äôs happening with Line 3.

A treaty is currently being broken, US law enforcement paid by the Canadian oil company for man power.
The indigenous need help along with many endangered species that rely on that water."
0,Well he is guilty like the former Orange Man female genitalia grabber. And all those who cover for them are abuser too.
0,"For every courageous women who refuse to be abused in silence there are multiples who still live in fear and suffering, they must feel safe to come forward, also there must be sever consequences for those who help the harasser cover up"
0,"I'm still waiting for the media and democrats to pressure Congressman Matt Gaetz to do the same and also legally force Trump's hand to submit his DNA in a possible rape case. Cuomo resigning is a win, and his replacement looks very promising comparably, but we need to pressure the other side of the aisle enough to get similar results."
0,"I love this. As a fellow Democrat I'm glad he resigned but am disappointed he seemed to feel no remorse, and took no blame. We have to be the party to take the higher ground, because we know they never will."
0,"I‚Äôm in awe of how AOC (or the person who runs her account) can articulate the modern complexities of civil rights. I do wish he was around to progress the Trump cases,I‚Äôm hoping it gets done with the same fortitude."
2,I don‚Äôt agree he should not have resigned. He was good for the state and got things done. This is the first time I have ever disagreed with AOC.
1,"Once again, the Democrats eat their young while Republicans revel in delight. I wonder how we'll all feel when a Republican wins the governorship and Trump gets a NY pardon."
2,Agreed. I was disappointed in his statement about the line being ‚Äúredrawn‚Äù. It‚Äôs a face saving excuse and he needs to drop that and admit he knew he could flex his power over women because he‚Äôs been the governor. We need truth.
2,"Totalitarianism
doesn‚Äôt work without the introduction of delusional psychosis.
Also, narcissism."
0,"Thank you AOC, for helping blow the dust and cobwebs off institutions of power that have operated in the shadows for too long. Your courage is contagious and very much needed right now. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
0,"I agree with everything you said. But I am getting tired of the Dems always being the ones to stand up and take their own out for this type of BS behavior, while the GOP ignore it and let it continue and refuse to do the same with their own. We need to force them to do the same!"
2,We won‚Äôt forget how you forced Cuomo out with zero due process. Absolutely shameful. You will never hold higher office.
2,You need to recommrnd to your supporters what preferences to give for Mayor
0,AOC for president i love you Alexandria.

2,How convenient. A list of people I won't vote for. Thanks Alex.
1,"Anybody else notice that Dems have been running America‚Äôs cities and inner cities for 3-4 generations and havent fixed them yet? As a matter of fact they continue to get worse‚Ä¶worse schools, more homelessness, more crime, etc. Yet Dems want you to believe they have more, new ideas that will fix the mess they created. So isn‚Äôt voting D like the definition of insanity?"

2,"I always liked Maya Wiley when she was guest on MSNBC. However, I never thought she was as RADICAL as Bernie and his squad. Hope, a more moderate wins!!"
2,Coming from a person who can't even take care of her own grandmother the poor lady lives in poverty well AFC lives in luxury how sad is that
2,I remember last year how you helped Ed Markey get reelected to the Senate and saw you on TV with my Congressman Seth Moulton this morning.
0,i love AOC...perhaps the most anti-American congresswoman in the U.S. Bella Abzug would whip her butt for all the bad things she says about the nation. I hope she gives up riding in a car or flying in a jet between DC and NYC. She should walk her way into the Green New Feel! AOC for Prez. The end of the National Socialist Democratic Party along with her.

2,Our country is in a violence crisis and we need to do something about it.
2,"Even if it was an ""accident,"" anyone in almost any other profession who ""accidentally"" kills someone would face severe consequences."
2,How about some personal accountability for the people that are breaking the law and putting themselves into this
2,"Please don‚Äôt continue to support the very system your party now has ostensible power over. The drones, the detentions, the platitudes about common ground with those without human compassion or decency. You were one of the few who gave average people hope. Don‚Äôt be Fredo I beg of you. Don‚Äôt break our hearts."
2,"Pouring gas on a fire. Investigation barely even begun. You're part of the problem, you're helping grow a ""guilty until Proven Innocent"" society. Unless it meets your agenda of course.
Shame on you."
2,"I am angry and appalled at the recent events involving police and deaths of young black men. With that out of the way,I am the mother of a hard working, caring, good police officer who puts his life in danger on a very consistent basis. While those that do wrong should without a doubt be punished, let's not forget that there are more good cops than bad ones. Recruitment of police officers in this day and age is a challenge and it doesn't help that they are not paid enough for what they do either. Just remember to judge the individual for their actions and not every cop on the beat. I sincerely hope to see change to make everyone safer"
2,It‚Äôs a tragic incident for all parties involved.. so sad he had to resist and cause the escalation.
1,Way to incite violence Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A mistake that cost someone their life and was admitted to by the cop. End of story.
0,It is always right to criticize law enforcement in the United States. People think it's a crime -- especially after -- but it's a right.
0,"I heard a report today that none of the Brooklyn Center police force actually live in the community. If this is true, this is also a problem. A community's police department should reflect the community in which they protect and serve. This won't solve everything, but if the police are of the people of their community, they may have a different level of investment in its people. And more good police need to call out bad police."
2,"Question is , what are you politicians doing about it , or do you prefer to talk just enough to get re-elected? Do what they need you to do instead of saying it if you really want to make a difference! Once election season come around we the people Hear and watch nothing but promises and no action !"
1,"At the same time why not educate the ppl not to flee and obey the officers orders, in most cases at the max you would be arrested, warned or cited for wrong doing. But if you have a warrant ofcourse they arrest you. Obeying officers orders was one of things I was taught by my seniors when I arrived into US into 2006. Hope the young and vulnerable learn a lesson in addition to better training and rules for the officers to bring a positive change in the society. Bashing each other and politicizing the issue will only make mattes worse. Side note that kid at 20 should be in college not parenting a 2yr old boy, thats a broader problem this cntry has to address."
1,Just another reminder that it‚Äôs a dangerous profession being a criminal and resisting arrest. Let‚Äôs hold the criminals as accountable as we all want police to be.
1,"It was an unfortunate accident. At the end of the day the main lesson that should be learned from all of these unfortunate events is, ( stop resisting arrest). It will never end well. You fight the arrest in court, not on the street. Stop pointing the finger and take some personal accountability.
If you really want to lead Ms. Cortez, then this should be your message. I know you have good intentions, but you're going at this from the wrong direction."
2,"Your comments are not based on on emotion and presumption. The facts in this case do not support your assertions.This is very irresponsible behavior from a public figure and I would expect that people in positions of power and influence would feel the need to hold themselves to a higher standard. Great leaders seek the facts and stand up for what is right even when it is not popular. They bring people together, they don't divide and instigate."
2,His mistake costs him his life. Her mistake gets her early retirement with a pension and a chance to double dip with another police dept.
2,Or.. It was a criminal with a warrant resisting arrest who unfortunately was shot during a tragic
2,"The actual investigation has barely started. She admitted her mistake verbally on body cam. She resigned, she will be going to court. Ppl so negative b4 anything has even happened."
0,"The real way to end this type of crap is:
- Remove qualified immunity.
- Require ALL officers to carry $1M in malpractice insurance just like doctors and lawyers.
- Tie civil awards to the police retirement fund. Example: If there is a $3M award for misconduct $1M comes from the officer's insurance and the $2M comes from the retirement fund and NOT the tax payers.
- Create a national database of discredited officers (just like they do with lawyers and doctors) so if they apply for another law enforcement position their past WILL follow them."
2,How about people comply with the officers orders. Do not resist
0,"Excuse me for saying so, but it seems a bit odd that a woman who has been a police officer for 26yrs would 'mistakenly' draw her gun thinking it was her taser, if she doesn't know the difference between the two after 26yrs then she shouldn't be a cop at all and she sure as hell shouldn't be excused, or forgiven, for making such a stupid, not to mention fatal, rookie mistake..."
2,She should not be allowed to keep her pension!
0,how does a 25 year veteran not know the difference between a GUN and a Taser? O r better still how do they not know that the punishment for expired tags or misdemeanors is still NOT DEATH.
1,"...says the socialist who wants to increase state violence, authority, and spending."
2,Definitely a tragedy and avoidable. Maybe not run from the cops also. That might help
0,"The reason the cops pulled Daunte Wright over: He had an air freshener dangling from his mirror which was supposedly blocking his view.

I feel like that part of the story doesn‚Äôt get enough attention. Really makes you wonder if they were just looking for a reason to pull people over."
0,"Let‚Äôs not forget the mass proliferation of guns among USA citizens...so that police fear being killed with every racially profiled pull over. You can thank the misinterpretati
on of the second amendment and the NRA for that."
2,Time to end qualified immunity.
1,Tip of the day: Don‚Äôt fight with the police if you don‚Äôt want to get shot.
2,"When our grandchildrens grandchildren won't be able to pay back what we spent, it's too much. Especially when the entity responsible for ""fixing the problem"" is well known for its past great successes like the war on drugs, the war on terror, the war on poverty, etc."
2,Funny they never say it's too much when waging war.
2,Too much is when you decimate the American economy and send manufacturing jobs overseas only to create even worse pollution on the other side of the earth. Too much is when the government spends seniors SS money on programs to create more dependent voters. Too much is when govt overregulates businesses including child care facilities so much that they need a lawyer in house to navigate those laws/ regulations.
0,Bernie is not radical. He's just a honest to god democrat. The corporate lobbies just hate the truth. What made america great was a strong middle class not a handful of billionaires. Reasonable people need to vote. Not just the clowns.

And hey I've invented a new antidepressant anti-anxiety antipsychotic

an ability to buy food and think clearly,
a fondness for red flags,

And hey I think we just might make it,

2,"Bernie Sanders
Are you ready for a radical statement? I happen to think that Joe Manchin is right. Yeah, physical infrastructure is terribly important. But I happen to think that the needs of the human beings of our country ‚Äî working families, the children, the elderly, the poor ‚Äî are even more important, and we can and must do both.
Look, everybody in America ‚Äî whether you're Republican, Democrat or independent ‚Äî understands that, for the last many years, the very richest people in this country and the largest corporations have done phenomenally well, while the working class and the middle class of this country struggle, and we have got close to 600,000 people sleeping out on the streets.

Elderly people in America can't afford to put dentures into their mouth. They have no teeth in their mouth in some cases, can't afford hearing aids, can't afford eyeglasses. Working families cannot afford child care for their kids. Young people cannot afford to go to college.

And then on top of all of that, the scientific community is telling us that we're looking at a cataclysmic crisis in terms of climate. Oregon is burning. California is burning.

People are drowning in New York City. Detroit is flooding. Siberia has seen the largest fire on Earth. Drought is happening in places all over the world.

The United States must lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel. This is a crisis we are living in.

So, what polling tells us is that working families all over this country understand that NOW is the time for Congress to address the long neglected problems facing working families. Now is the time to have the wealthy and large corporations -- we've got billionaires in this country who don't pay a nickel in federal income tax.
So, I think we can do all of this. We can do the physical infrastructure.
We can do the reconciliation bill, create millions of good jobs, and finally tell the American people that we are going to stand up for working families ‚Äî not just the rich and the powerful. Let's get it done.

Reminder: The actual cost of the Build Back Better Act is not $3.5 trillion, it's $0. The funding working families need is going to be paid for by taxing the wealthiest and corporations."

To consume a thing, is to extinguish a thing.

2,"Bernie ur great, but u been saying the same stuff for years, & nothing been done.

So here's a NEW IDEA.
Can u & ur colleagues start referring to health insurance has a SOCIALIST CONCEPT, and belongs in a SOCIALIST MODEL.

Just saying it's a human right is fine, but that doesn't move the needle to much. U have to get ppl to see the logic, and change their minds. And u can do that better, by exposing the health insurance companies by doing the messaging this way.

How do health insurance companies make money?

They collect premiums r deny ppl coverage. THAT'S IT! And if u think about that, what is that, that's a SOCIALIST CONCEPT. If the CEO of XYZ insurance company is not happy making $5 million a year, they want to make 50 millon a year, what do they have to do, r the only thing they can do, is raise PREMIUMS r DENY ppl coverage. THAT'S IT. That's a socialist CONCEPT & belongs in a socialist MODEL. If u put a SOCIALIST concept into a CAPITALIST model, it will butt heads. It will not be as efficient r effective. And that's what we have now. And vice verse, u don't want a CAPITALIST concept in a SOCIALIST model. Otherwise, we'll all be waiting hours in line for stale bread. It's not like the CEO of walmart, if they want to make more money, they have to sell more, r be more efficient in their operations.Thus
, CAPITALIST CONCEPT, belongs in CAPITALIST MODEL. Same goes for health insurance companies. It's a SOCIALIST CONCEPT, & belongs in a SOCIALIST MODEL. Bcuz all they can do to make more money is raise premiums & deny ppl coverage. And that puts the squeeze on patients & doctors.

If u do the messaging this way, this will move the needle more to universal health insurance, bcuz ppl will see the truth & logic. Instead of just saying it's a human right, which it is, but to get more ppl to believe in universal health insurance, u need to do the messaging this way. A socialist CONCEPT belongs in a socialist MODEL. At minimum it should be non-profit.

I have some good ideas how to make to get this point across. And I'm sure, if u start this messaging, it will get done. Start beating the Republicans at their own game."

That is the sad part is you have fooled people into actually believing your lies. Those people acting like fools have only made you richer and richer than the 1% that you pretend to be against.

At this point and with our knowledge, any doctor or hospital who does not prescribe Ivermectin for Covid is an egregious crimminal fraud and murderer.

2,We‚Äôre tired of paying American politicians the highest price on the planet. It‚Äôs probably why insulin prices are the highest. Makes sense huh?
2,"The difference is our 700 military bases around the planet. You know, ""for keeping us safe."""
0,"How about including everyone who pays into Medicare through payroll deductions already, in the Medicare program, regardless of age?
How much does a Medicare patient pay for insulin today?"
0,Also need dental and eye coverage for seniors. Why retire and loose two costly benwfits
2,I‚Äôm sick and tired of people being sick and tired. I‚Äôm tired of people needing insulin in the first place. The cost of the drugs isn‚Äôt the problem! The fact that so many need them is the problem. Why are so many Americans sick? That‚Äôs what people need to focus on!
0,"Yes, we need medical for all, apply 2% extra tax for medical below 65."
2,I agree this is a problem. But very few people use insulin in a vial these days. Let's talk about insulin pens and get up to speed. Or perhaps compare the average cost for 1 month's supply of insulin.
0,"Absolutely terrible the way we are charged for drugs. That should be number one for Congress, but hey, they don‚Äôt care about us and they have GREAT medical coverage. Maybe make them have what we do and have to actually pay for it and just maybe there will be a change. Seems like only Bernie is fighting for us. Keep it up Bernie maybe some day we will win."
2,"Paying $12 for life saving medicine should be something everyonr demands, regardless of party. It's ridiculous to let greedy pharmacy companies to have control over life saving meds or any meds for that matter. My wish is to see companies that exploited and caused the of people made to pay restitution. Hey,its better than tarred and feathered...whi
ch would include politicians who support greed companies."
2,"Absolutely. It‚Äôs K Street that‚Äôs responsible for this, and, of course, the politicians they bribe. We should make bribes to politicians illegal."
2,"And for those of us who choose healthy nutritional alternatives, such as juice that has kept my brain tumor from growing for 14 years that I have to pay $153 out of pocket instead of it's being paid for along with my vitamins and supplements which would be paid for in the Canadian system, and hopefully in Medicare for all. Please, please call Congress 202-224-3121 insist they bring medicare-for-al
l Bill to a vote now! With it covering Vision, Dental, mental health and long-term care"
2,hope it doesnt sound like gloating( im not) but vaccines are free in the uk ( as is all health care)... save the NHS...it wasnt given but hard fought for against the establishment of the time 1948...
2,"We‚Äôve been hearing this problem for years‚Ä¶. No one cares. Congress has so many other things more important to do than these drugs prices‚Ä¶ like fighting over masks, abortion rights, how to take back control of the Congress next year blah blah blah‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs all they care ‚Ä¶ Forget it, we are on our own‚Ä¶"
2,Also insulin is usually free in Canada if you have supplemental insurance.
2,"That's the cost of pharmaceuticals
paying politicians. We are the ones paying for the corruption."
2,Our health care system is probably one of the best examples of how warped the definition of freedom is in the United States.
2,It is my understanding if implemented the proposed changes aimed at seniors won‚Äôt go into effect until 2028.
2,"Until our Congress and that includes every Democrat, Independent, and Republican, man and woman, STOPS taking bribes (monetary donations) from the Pharmaceutical companies in our USA, we will NEVER have the benefit of negotiating the lowest price! It is the same exact reason we will never have Universal Health Care (Medicare For All)! No other Country in our world has paid higher costs for medicine and health care, than the USA!"
2,Drug companies wouldn't have to charge it they didnt have to have stock piles of money for law suits in this country. Ever drug out there a lawyer trying to bv sue them over
2,"Buy a bus pass. Canadian taxes are extremely high, but they get a lot for their money unlike California."
2,As long as the uninsured aren't charged the maximum inflated amount to make up for lost profits.
2,We need to wake up to what's going on. We first need to vote and get out Country back before it's too late. There are way to many distractions. We are so close to becoming a dictatorship. Then we will not have to worry about any of this other stuff. We'll have nothing. We will be lookingüôè for a Country to take us in -as immigrants and see how kind that will be for us.
2,The engine that drives capitalism is competition. When there is a monopoly there is no competition. Russian and American oligarchs gave us rule by monopoly-ist.
2,We should also be talking about how to prevent type 2 diabetes with a proper human diet.
2,"Yup. Having grown up in both, I can say there are some notable and noticeable aberrations in the neighbouring pharmaceutical philosophies."
2,We are all sick of it but Congress is getting paid off too much by big Pharma so nothing will change. Greed needs to stop in Congress FIRST! Can you get that done???
0,"The laws of supply and demand are so easily manipulated to benefit the seller and satisfy the stock holder. ""Nothing personal, it's just business"" a quote from ""The Godfather"" is the mantra of the drug industry. Moral, ethical and fair trade practices are gone the way of the dinosaurs. It's the way of Trumpian economics. I'm left wondering if the corporations can be held culpable of involuntary malicious homicide. Given the drugs the deceased needed are less costly a few miles away in Canada...ü§îüò≤üò°üòî"
2,So lotteries for people with the vaccine. Free testing free vaccines. Huh no free insulin?
0,I thought the solution was to cut the tax of the Novo Nordisk CEO? That‚Äôs what you were moaning about before‚Ä¶
2,"I'm Swedish, but if I had been American I would have fought hard for improving the health care system in the US, the richest country in the world. Sure, many people think of Sweden as a communist hellhole (we're not a communist country, we have a social democratic government, labour party), and we DO pay higher taxes compared to many other countries (but not a 60 % flat rate income tax, a lot of people are convinced we pay that). Anyway, the taxes are spent on health care among other things. Insulin is free, no cost for the patient at all.

Yes, I'm very aware you can't compare the US to Sweden. We're a small country with a different system. But if anyone is going to change the system, it's Bernie. He would be a kick-*ss president.

I'm an outsider looking in, and to me it seems like your system allows the greedy companies to be in control, to do as they please and charge people whatever they want."
2,"Yes, Bernie, who cannot agree? But the shareholders, Bernie, the shareholders! They vote too."
2,"I am sick and tired of hearing you and your ilk using this as a platform, but never actually doing anything about it at all."
2,"Sick of being suckered by the politicians who are paid by big Pharma to keep prices up , we are being scalped by the politicians who are supposed to be protecting us. Vote all the bums out until they stop screwing us."
2,"Yes - this is unacceptable. EVERYONE thinks it's unacceptable - everyone except certain greedy lawmakers. We need to replace representatives
who refuse to do the will of the people."
2,All republicans and three democrats voted against letting Medicare negotiate drug prices. What‚Äôs next?
2,"Cost in Australia if your 60 yrs old or older. Or make less than 39,000 . 5 dollars. For everyone else 12 dollars Australian ."
0,"Go Bernie! That is exactly on point! Keep on it and make it an issue in the upcoming elections. Accountability!
! Thanks for the continued effort."
1,"You know, might as well start a news show, the way you feed us information, but don't seem to be doing anything. If this is the way Democrats deal with being in power.... we got a tough fucking road ahead."
2,Anyone that's been in congress for decades and allowed this to legally happen should be in prison
2,"I bet that vile in Canada costs $100 but since the government pays a subsidy, the patients part is $12."
2,"Why can't Americans just buy the insulin from Canada? Let me guess, because the government says so."
2,"Cost of one vial in Puerto Rico, Lantus $485 dls, Insulin Lispro (humalog) 375 dls. üò¢"
2,"Then do something. Talk, talk, talk. Can‚Äôt rally the troops Bernie?"
2,The solution to this might be to prevent diabetes in people in the first place
2,Who will subsidize the drug companies profits if we won‚Äôt.
0,"Well Bernie, seems like the republicans like for us to pay the higher prices n there is something that you n me can do!!! VOTE for Team Blue!!"
2,You are an angry old man who needs to retire. You bring nothing to our country or it‚Äôs people. Never have.
2,You also need to fix the patent system since Big Pharma routinely game that
2,If government got out of the way the price would naturally come down.

0,we are fighting for our democracy the Republicans are trying to take it away. The Republicans don't believe in democracy. We can't have Republicans rule any branch of government. We are fighting for democracy or we will get a dictatorship look at Florida Georgia and Texas. Other states are trying to pass voter suppression bills. We need a democracy or our constitution doesn't mean anything.

2,"Yes it‚Äôs come a long way from my Public Health Nursing day of like all about our Government (Republican now) and the allowance of pharmaceutical companies to be greedy legally and get away with it.
No party has helped it get better and these posts don‚Äôt & won‚Äôt make a difference.
There needs to be a elite that financially can take the Pharmaceutical Companies on.
Otherwise, we all know it will not happen. The government won‚Äôt and us, common people can‚Äôt afford the battle to bring our drugs down in cost.
They are outrageous compared to even Mexico costs for Rx drugs."
2,"In the UK, a vial of insulin averages the equivalent of $7.20"

Oooooo it is taxpayer money not bernies"
1,democrats so misinformed
2,"What I don't get is how the corporation gets sole ownership of the patent if the American citizens are paying for the research and development of many of these drugs.

First, that sounds 100% like an administrative failure. Drug companies don't just get this research funding out of thin air. They negotiate with the government for them. Exactly like with the Covid vaccines. That deal has been outstanding for the American people. Could you imagine if everyone had to buy our vaccines out of pocket or through insurance? We probably wouldn't have 25% of Americans vaccinated, and they'd be coming from Europe.

I would laugh in the face of a drug co CEO if he came to me with a bullshit deal like what we have been getting. I would feel like he was spitting in my face. I would kick them out of the White House and call his biggest competitor asking if they would like to be the first drug company to release xyz drug? Yeah? Great, but if Americans are paying for the research we get royalties on sales which will go to help fund future medical research, and there will be cap limits on American patients, with lower caps for the elderly and veterans. We would get that drug developed and CEOs would seriously think twice about going to the White House thinking that they are going to scam the American people."

TooFarLeft
Education is a good investment from an individual, family, community or national perspective and tuition free education will reduce the burden from the root on our medical expenses too for example.

Healthcare for all is actually CHEAPER with the insurance industry off of the table along with most of the time lost due to billing among many other reasons.

A universal basic income (UBI) is CHEAPER than all of the thousands of individual federal, state and local social safety net programs including things like Social Security and unemployment insurance, etc with all of their budgets, overhead expenses and inefficiencies eliminating the humiliating need for people to lose time to prove their poverty to qualify for aid.

Internet for all is a great and necessary investment to give everyone the opportunity to study, search for work, work remotely, etc online.

Solar power is CHEAPER and electric vehicles are soon to be CHEAPER to make and already are considerably CHEAPER to maintain and operate, especially if charged from your own solar power.

What do you think will happen to crime rates, peace and equality in general after we launch universal healthcare, a universal basic income, universal education and internet for all, raising the starting point of capitalism from zero, we‚Äôll let you die with no money, to a level of life with dignity, reducing societal daily fears on a massive scale and freeing us to welcome the automation revolution with open arms rather than with fear and great harm? üòÉ EqualityMovemen

Depriving the manufacturers of their intellectual property, investment return, worthwhile risk, and return on costly research. Often times forcing those companies to sell drugs below cost rather than being put out of business. The US couldn‚Äôt care less about protecting innovations and intellectual property abroad so those companies have to make a profit somewhere. That all being said, you are highly full of üí© as usual not sharing free and substantially lower prices that your followers could receive (yes, WITHOUT insurance). I wonder how much innovation in medicine we‚Äôd have if we didn‚Äôt have incentives for companies to make new medical progress. I sure bet a socially managed drug world would stifle the advancement that these companies do and create. Focus on stopping your comrades in other countries and the white house from stealing from innovators and make them all pay their fair share. Why is there never any substance, background or solutions that exist that you can share? Greed my ass. Explain the dynamics and why what happens does. Hint: drug companies need to turn a profit and take on tremendous amounts of risk, failure, and loss. Protect American companies from getting robbed by socialist country extortion artists, defend intellectual property, and the prices will come down. You have such a presence and platform that could be used for good. All you do is fear monger instead of providing existing solutions and support for innovation. Socialist America is its own worst enemy. I wonder how many people you kill each year by convincing them it‚Äôs hopeless when there are options for them to get their medications for next to nothing or free."

I commend the Palm Springs City Council for going further than almost every other city, even the most progressive, in enacting both a vaccine and a mask mandate. Even San Francisco and New York have only mandated one or the other.

The city should now mandate medical grade masks, since cloth masks are virtually useless. In fact, they should unilaterally re-enact Newsom‚Äôs old color coded system, and require strict capacity limitations and masking outdoors. We need at least a 50% capacity restriction, plus a mask mandate, plus a vaccine mandate to control the virus now. And leave more restrictions options on the table if people just won‚Äôt behave.

2,"Corporate america is in every nook and cranny in the two houses of American legislature, bribing the politicians."
2,good unless we hold all parties to account they keep fleecing us
1,Republicans already control the Senate 52-48 Manchin and Sinema ensure it...
2,The 30% corporate tax cut bled the country dry.

I fixed it for you.

It's not a complete ban, they changed the timing of it, made the cutoff earlier. That's been debated forever."

2,"Citizens United needed to be overturned, but I don't see that happening with the poor excuse for a Supreme Court currently in place."
2,you know the other option is get a job and pay the rent. In all my life I never thought I'd see this. I had my own apartment when I was a teenager. I worked and went to school. I knew that I needed to pay the rent or I'd get locked out of my place... it was that simple.. you know why I knew this.. because my parents were horrible at this and I lived with a history of getting evicted from homes as a child. you keep doing this and you're teaching these people that there are no consequences to their actions. you cannot tell me it's because they cannot find a job... I see for hire signs EVERYWHERE. STOP THIS MADNESS!
2,"I so wish the media would stop calling these people ""moderates."""
2,It's amazing and very disappointing how so many don't care about the people who voted for them. It's time to take this power back and vote these people out of off to the point where the numbers are so great..that they can't be refuted.
1,The Republicans are offering a great opportunity to end the filibuster. Take it
2,IMHO neither party is really working for the 'average working person'. But the Democrats are closer to being. Both sides can't afford to irritate the donors who finance their campaigns.
2,"GREED, NOTHING CHANGES, THE BIG CORPORATIONS WANT ALL THE RIGHTS AND THE MONEY, THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS SHAMFUL, IS TNIS REALLY AMERICA"
1,More $ for having children that they can‚Äôt support. It pays to have all the dads disappear. Even MORE free $.
2,Ignore it. The expenditures were already authorized.
2,Why???? Because the wealthy own them. This will not change until the SCOTUS Citizens United decision is overturned.
2,Nothing going to change as long as big money in politics. We all run out to vote nothing change but wallets.
2,Plenty to worry about plus all that other stuff filling hospitals etc.
1,"A child tax credit that your children will have to eventually pay for with increased taxes.

2,This problem goes way back to the 70s and even earlier if you remember when they shot people for setting back fire's to clear the Forests of dead dry ground cover. So No. I see the Teachers Union got there pay raise and a 2500 dollar side pay. I say stop the CTA and get the MONEY from the California LOTTERY as it was sold to us. Now it's there just to pay for a Union pay out and there family members. I. Wish all Californians can get Insurance like THAT.

1,"Sinema is a hypocrite on a number of issues, not just the drug bill. She is a sell-out to the moneyed Republicans who have essentially paid for her services. Call her what she is - a political prostitute! - P.W."
2,"Why I vote for the ""person"" running for office and not the ""party""... because there are crooks and con's in both parties. What happen to honesty and integrity?"
2,"It's the first time someone has given me credit for having children. I am going to buy a new laser engraving machine with the money and start celebrating ""Taco Tuesday"" again at the Brig. This is my way of showing what a shame this ""child"" tax credit is."

Why do we put up with this, and pay her salary??
We‚Äôre a country of fools, being robbed every day."
2,Because they're wealthy owned by the wealthy too...DUH
2,"Graft and greed, buying a senator!!!"
0,"I voted for Sinema because she ran as a democrat, if she wants to be independent maybe she should run like one and not as a democrat. I will pay close attention to who runs against her."

2,How does that thinking apply to vaccinations?
2,"People need to throw this in her face when she decides to block real progress based on ""principles."" She clearly has none."
0,"I agree.
‚ÄòReasonable people can disagree about when a zygote becomes a ""human life"" - that's a philosophical question. However, regardless of whether or not one believes a fetus is ethically equivalent to an adult, it doesn't obligate a mother to sacrifice her body autonomy for another, innocent or not.

Body autonomy is a critical component of the right to privacy protected by the Constitution, as decided in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), McFall v. Shimp (1978), and of course Roe v. Wade (1973). Consider a scenario where you are a perfect bone marrow match for a child with severe aplastic anemia; no other person on earth is a close enough match to save the child's life, and the child will certainly die without a bone marrow transplant from you. If you decided that you did not want to donate your marrow to save the child, for whatever reason, the state cannot demand the use of any part of your body for something to which you do not consent. It doesn't matter if the procedure required to complete the donation is trivial, or if the rationale for refusing is flimsy and arbitrary, or if the procedure is the only hope the child has to survive, or if the child is a genius or a saint or anything else - the decision to donate must be voluntary to be constitutional.
This right is even extended to a person's body after they die; if they did not voluntarily commit to donate their organs while alive, their organs cannot be harvested after death, regardless of how useless those organs are to the deceased or many lives they would save. That's the law.

Use of a woman's uterus to save a life is no different from use of her bone marrow to save a life - it must be offered voluntarily. By all means, profess your belief that providing one's uterus to save the child is morally just, and refusing is morally wrong. That is a defensible philosophical position, regardless of who agrees and who disagrees. But legally, it must be the woman's choice to carry out the pregnancy. She may choose to carry the baby to term. She may choose not to. Either decision could be made for all the right reasons, all the wrong reasons, or anything in between. But it must be her choice, and protecting the right of body autonomy means the law is on her side. Supporting that precedent is what being pro-choice means.‚Äô‚Äù ~ from a friend"
1,"No surprise there, moderate democrats = gop lite."
2,"She may be bought and paid for ( owned ) by big pharmaceutical companies, but her constituents are feed up with her. I'm an AZ democrat who voted for her, and I will NOT make that mistake again! Her votes have been a huge slap in the face to her AZ constituents. She is voting against everything she campaigned on, and her constant are watching. She may only get a second term as an AZ Senator if she switches and becomes a republican. Dems in AZ are feed up with her votes and her VERY childish drama."
2,"Most likely she became friends with mr Manchin‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs Bigly lying Pharma friends to meet with Bigly Pharma lobbyist to negotiate bribery money, instead of voting for a legitimate legislation that would help More than half of the population in medical care !!!

1,California's crusade to save the environment has caused more problems than they have solved

1,"Living in Melbourne, Australia has become mentally crushing. Yesterday we had only 50 people testing positive to Covid. But we only have 25 people in hospital and 5 in ICU & no deaths at all this year - that is state wide total - not per day. But the entire state of over 5 million is in lockdown, curfew 9pm-5am, can only travel 5km from home, allowed outside for only 1 hour per day to excercise, all businesses except for essential services are closed-most are now backrupt, schools are still closed. This is our 6th lockdown - we have had more than 200 days in lockdown and no school attendance for 200 days. The mental health in the school aged children is our new pandemic but Victorian government will not address it - or even discuss it at their daily press conference. Violent protests are not the answer - but we are not surprised that it is sadly coming to this.üò¢"
2,Had enough? Going to get worse if you don't vote them out! See Australia!
1,Whether you're vaccinated or not please boycott any business that participates in these passports or mandates. Our Freedom is at stake and money still talks!

2,"One of the few things that I am really getting very annoyed with is the claim that it is only/
those who voted for Trump, who are not getting vaccinated. I do not believe that is true., there probably are some. As there are also probably some voters who haven't been vaccinated either."
2,"Anyone listening to politicians for any medical advice deserves whatever happens to them. And by politicians, I include so called public health officials. They are politicians."
2,So sad to see what is happening to this country‚Ä¶ right before our eyes.

1,"I haven‚Äôt worn a mask from the very beginning. I will not comply to medical staff or to this administrations
attempt to control the American people! Citizens need to stand your ground!"

0,"Im no longer a proud Aussie.Its disgusting what the governments are doing here, especially increasing police powers. We are fed up here."
1,frightening thing is there are quite a few people in this country who not only accept being micro managed with authoritarian restrictions and mandates but actually demand it
1,Covidiots at their finest. Sadly I know many who do and would think this is completely fine and normal. They are lost and will reap what they sow.
2,Before she sets foot on House floor she must undertake COVID test and show her passport for negative test results before she travels back to DC.
2,"Tucker, you are the closest person I know to any ""elite"". Please pass this on. I do no care what that women thinks, feels, says or smells like. She is NOTHING to me or MY Country."

1,"This is insanity. Welcome to communism. So sad and scary, but this is truly where we are headed."
1,How much longer does this have to go on? Trump won. We need our audits done across the Country and we need our President back.
2,I believe a good reason the lockdowns have not been as bad in the US is because the average american owns guns.
2,"You don‚Äôt need a mask at Obama‚Äôs birthday party either, Covid doesn‚Äôt spread at Democratic functions"
2,"The ""law "" is only for poor and uneducated people. I remember they said that for Obama's Birthday party."
1,People need to start buying guns and protect their families because the government is up to something bad
1,"All about control and one world government. Being locked in your home with no interaction with others is not a life. We either take a stand and refuse to be bullied and isolated, or they will continue to take away our freedom."
2,"This whole segment is very interesting, thought provoking and scary at the same time. I can‚Äôt believe the direction the world is heading, so sad."
0,This is a group of very sophisticated people isn't that what was said about Obama's party? I'm sure covid knows this.
1,Where are all the liberals defending this??? This whole mask issue is just to see who will comply for what's really coming are way. Wake up!! Rules for thee not for me!!
1,"What's funny to me is that the people that are on board with the masks, shot, and stay at home orders REALLY believe that it will end. That it's only temporary. They never notice the gov never speaks of an end. Just more and more restrictions. It's horrifying to think people are this blind."
1,Radical left will try to get every one of our rights eliminated.
1,"After so long of being told to stay home, don‚Äôt talk or interact with anyone and mandatory lockdowns the people will get tired of it! The people will raise up against their ‚Äúleaders‚Äù and we will see countries succumb to revolutions much like the French Revolution! The people will get tired of being controlled, lied to and fed lines that the governing bodies knows what‚Äôs best for you while they‚Äôre actively breaking their own mandates and requirements to semi participate in society."
1,I have a sense of humor. I won't take a joke (Nancy Pelosi) seriously.
1,Maybe now Australians will regret giving away there firearms rights
1,"Pelosi was tricked into giving this speech for $30,000 for each ticket. Just like she got tricked into getting a haircut when she had the salon owner open up her non-essential business."

1,"I live in Melbourne and would move to Florida if the Australian Government would open the borders and let us leave.

It is 1960""s Russia here."
1,People must have been smarter back then because Democrats have been applying the mask mandates for us peasants for over a year but not following the same mandates themselves and we keep allowing it to happen.

1,Highest hypocrisy from dems. A little bit of science and anyone can get that mask doesn‚Äôt protect but destroys your lungs and immune system.
2,Complete control of we the people using scare tactics until we expose them for what they really are. Domestic Terrorist groups and this Tyranny group are all about totally controlling we the people and destroying our Great Society any way they can so they can stay in power
2,"Here in Washington state the governor's mandate on the vaccine, excludes himself, all cabinet members, all state commissioners, and all state board members, but their employees MUST get the vaccine. Makes you go hmmm."
2,"Worst thing about it: I saw footage of protest here on facebook from some Australian outlet. And 99% of comments was: ""so many stupid and selfish people, they deserve what they got, they treated them too lightly.""
I found only 3 comments supporting the protesters.
I must say I was shocked especially by how many people used the term ""selfish"" parroting the mass media. Brainwashed."
2,"Disgusting. How can anyone continue to elect such garbage? Off topic, and this isn't a left or right thing, because there are plenty on the right too, but holding a government position for this long, gaining the wealth and power she has from it, shouldn't be allowed. For Pete's sake... üò°"

1,"When is Pelosi being impeached? Oh that's right, she's a Democrat. They are protected by hypocrisy."
2,I was just talking about this. I don't watch Fox News anymore but this is exactly what I have been trying to say. Look at the tyrannical policies being enforced. It's coming to the US if people don't wake up. Read the studies and look at the science. Don't just take the word of mainstream media. They are trying to push a narrative that is absolutely not supported by the science. This is absolutely sickening.
1,"Yes it is every bit as bad in Melbourne Australia as it appears!
200 plus days of hard lockdown plus a similar amount under heavy restrictions such as not being allowed to have any visitors, work, travel more than 5kms,( 3 miles), and curfew from 9pm to 5am.
We are under the control of an insane dictator obsessed with eradication of the virus while nuking everything!
Kids and people are topping themselves or attempting to, and going around the bend.
Fine for going to the protest or disobeying rules is $5000 dollars!!
The mainstream media are pushing the same propaganda as the Andrews government has inflicted on us.
Lockdowns mightn't even end after we hit 80% vaccinated, now they're pushing for kids to be included!
I Weep for my children's future, democracy Worldwide has never been more in peril! üòï"

1,"I am from a Suburb in Sydney, NSW. Every morning at 11am all the MSM televise our Premier, Gladys Berajiglian ranting and raving about this Delta virus and the dangers of it. We went into lockdown on 26 June 2021 and as of Monday 23rd August, she placed a curfew, no one allowed out of their home between 9pm -5am. when this Delta outbreak began, she said 1,000sands are going to get the virus and 1,000sands are going to die. So far 130 have passed away, and I would be confident to say 100 died of old age and the rest died of other illnesses other than Delta. They even listed a 15yr old boy as a Covid death who was in Hospital for menningacoccal.
It is absolute Tyranny in the state of NSW. We are not even allowed to protest, the Government has given the Police force all powers to make sure of that.

They have scared the population so much that 6,000,000 have had at least 1 dose of the vaccine.

We are living in a nightmare in ""The Lucky Country."

We are under a curfew 9pm to 5am,and we need permits to work, and that's if your an essential worker, our lockdown rules are pretty harsh, I can't visit my daughters, can only travel over 5kms for work, not pleasure. No standard retail is open, only essential shopping centres, and Saturdays protest came out of pure frustration, people are tired of being locked away, it's a shame it came to that, but people are on edge. If we do get to 80% vaccination, Queensland and Western Australia have said they may not open their boarders to other states ,because they won't 0 covid, so yep we're doing it hard down under. üá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫"

1,This was seriously a scary segment. The hypocrisy from Nancy Pelosi is nothing new. She‚Äôs a disgrace. But the drama going on in Australia is unbelievable. I‚Äôm sure none of them are reporting any deaths from cancer or the flu or heart attacks. Over a year later‚Ä¶. And the WORLD still has zero clue.
2,We need to take back our government they are doing nothing for us.
0,"Martial law is coming to us soon, just watch! Our administration wants 2 classes of people, the very rich and the very poor who work to support the rich. Does this sound familiar? We‚Äôve seen it before, just not here‚Ä¶yet."
1,"Our KY state Governor has done same , caught in photos without mask in public events, after mandating masks.üò°"
1,"Why don't you wear a mask Pelosi and I'll do want I want, FREEDOM!"
2,This absolutely terrifying to me. Americans better wake the hell up & start fighting back!
1,Australia gave in when they gave up their guns they gave up their second amendment and they gave up everything that it took for their first amendment their third and everyone else after that Australia caved and they allowed it to happen plain and simple
1,"And they are coming to New Jersey too because our governor is a feckless progressive who has no respect for his constituents.
He prefers criminals illegals and people who like to give away taxpayers money like water."
1,"This is the end result of gun confiscation, what was shown going on in Australia is what happens to a docile unarmed populace. The only reason the powers that be here in the US cannot do what the Aussie's are doing is because of our 2nd Amendment and 500+ million weapons in civilian hands. Once push came to shove as seen with the authoritarianis
m in Australia, American's would fight back but we would not comply with this kind of brutality on our streets from the government. Of course this is just my opinion on what i just saw."
1,Wow! Mr Carlson it must be really frustrating and devastating for you to to provide these news to us. May the Angels of God be with you and your family. God bless you for your heroic love. A God help us deal with tge New world we are facing.
1,I bet they wish they wouldn't have gave up their firearms now. America would be just like this if we didn't have a 2nd Amendment
1,There is evidence that it also spreads via shedding or fecal matter‚Ä¶ so when they finally accept that bit of scientific data maybe they will realize that all the lockdowns and isolating people in groups trapped in their own domiciles was not the smartest idea. The people in charge are going about this all wrong.
2,"Stop calling our elected representatives
leaders!! They work for us and should be representing us‚Ä¶ not leading anything.. rather serving!!"
2,Apparently ppl back then had more integrity than ppl today!
0,I would suggest that Tucker Carlson and others concentrate on fixing what's wrong it their own back yard before they start knocking other places. As usual the story is dramatised out of proportion.
2,Actions always speak louder than words! She is as fake as they come!!
1,Intolerable laws sparked the 1775 revolutionary war of independence against the British Crown. Here we go again waiting for another war of independence against the Democrstic wealthy elite.
0,It will be alot of blood in the streets if that happens in this country to many people with guns and military training the don't agree with this behavior from the government. Just my opinion
2,"Tucker Carlson how dare you call the New Zealand President ""The lady with the teeth who is very popular""
Tucker Carlson, how dare you imply the Govenor of the State of Victoria is a lunatic for saying ""We are breaking the rules if we watch the sunset"" !
PS. I agree with you."
2,Unfortunately there are a number of people who can have all the evidence continually shoved in their faces and it will not make a bit of difference.
2,The hypocrisy within our government is beyond redemption. These oligarchs need to be removed before Americans will ever trust the government again. Does anyone know what the % is on Americans who don't trust the government is? It has to be higher than ever.
1,"It's so very sad for the real people of the United States of America, to have to continue to put up with the Biden administration what a load of rubbish the Biden administration has TURNED out to be. There's no way the real people of the United States of America are being held accountable for the Biden administration.
God bless you all."
1,"Australia is a perfect example when the people become complacent and allow their government to disarm them and rule over them.

Quite frankly I thought Australians were smarter than this. I can see Brits allowing it but I never thought the Aussies would."
2,They are ‚Äúsophisticated people‚Äù like the ones at Obama‚Äôs b-day party. No masks needed.
1,"Fact of the matter....peopl
e don't wear masks when they eat. Having this type of event in NAP with a high rate of COVID is typically Democratic poor optics and she doesn't care. She is the most powerful person in DC...more powerful than the President, and is in Napa to raise money for the Dems and preserve that woeful Gavin Newsome's governorship. Politics, power, and money are far more important to her...witness what she has or has not done for the people of CA in her time in Congress....and
the Dems continue to elect her......pitifu
l.....I left CA in 2013 for TN and while I love the state and all it offers, the politics, economics, social justice, and environmentalis
ts have ridden the Dem and state train into the ground...."
2,"Facebook keeps removing my ""Like"" and ""Angry"" status on this post. I wonder why? Is it going against their community standards?"
0,"Some of your facts are wrong, example only half of Australia is in Lockdown . Sydney NSW , and Melbourne VIC , the rest of the states ( 4 ) are open fully with no restrictions. The other facts are correct, but not explained fully. The man who sneezed in the lift has covid but will not isolate , he wasnts to spread covid to others that's why the Police are looking for him.
Religious services are banned because of lockdown rules , you can only zoom your services. This minister broke the rules knowingly and got caught. Yes the lockdown is over the top , only because of the low vaccine rate in the beginning, now the rates have increased dramatically . Enjoy your show from down under , Sydney, Australia .üëç"
1,"That‚Äôs the state of Victoria which is run by a communist, Daniel Andrews. The protesters should rally around recalling Andrews and running for political office to change these communist rules he‚Äôs put in place."
1,Her little drama queen aoc needs to be the first to wear a mask as well as Schumer and herself
2,Tucker Carlson Tonight I am Australian and the horse lady made me laugh for a bit then you got to the very real segments about Australia and I cried at how accurately wrong we are being treated it‚Äôs an absolute disgrace and so disheartening. Many here are just getting on with their lives whilst our fellow Australians just across the Queensland border into New South Wales are being treated like leapers. I am afraid for our children‚Äôs futures üò¢
2,Don‚Äôt worry about the police beating you with batons... they just want you to stay healthy. üôÑ
2,I'm surprised you did not mention the forced vü™ìination of children. They physically ripped children from their parents' arms and vü™ìinated them.
2,"If you haven‚Äôt watch the movie ‚ÄúThe Hunger Games‚Äù, go ahead and watch all! If you ever notice movies are years in advanced of what could and might happen to our world/ country! The thing is no one wants to believe it! Quit giving up your control! Vote these people out b4 it‚Äôs to late!"
2,How many times did she say young people in less than a minute. The young people are the vulnerable. Raise your kids right.
2,Oh god. This is too sad. As a New Zealander with friends and family in Australia hearing what a compliant community we are makes me realize just how we would have behaved in Nazi Germany.
2,We should have done this last summer when all the rioting and looting was going on. Our us police in every state should have been allowed to use the same kind of force.
2,It's coming to all nations. This is leading to the return of Jesus for the Church. The anti christ will be revealed. Ppl have seen nothing yet.
2,We are with you Australia stand up and fight for your right.
1,"Im an Aussie living in South Australia, we haven't had a new case of C19 for weeks and have had 4 deaths since the start of the plague, but we are still forced to wear face diapers in public."
2,"Anyone who thinks and feels your beneath them is worst than racism, especially when it's coming from your own goverment"
2,"Believe me, I can‚Äôt stand Pelosi, but in fairness this was outdoors, and I am way against giving the maskholes any more ammo."
1,They need to come after Nancy and Obama..... They just held Super spreader events.... LOL.
1,"The thugs in police uniforms started the violence, and sharpshooters wielding military spec automatic rifles were shooting pepper bombs at people, one hitting a 10 year old boy. Others shot rubber bullets, and at least 2 mounted among them ran their terrified horses directly at the people.

No Tucker, this is NOT the Australia you know, and whose Army Engineers‚Äô uniform I once wore with pride.

It‚Äôs now home to the socialist thugs running roughshod over the people. You‚Äôre right about one thing; Victorian, Queensland and Western Australian voters have recently voted them back in.

It‚Äôs unbelievable and, IF I could afford it, and IF I could leave (yes, locked in, locked up and locked down), I‚Äôd emigrate."
2,This kind of crap has been out there since the beginning the problem is people will not listen people will not take charge of thier own choices own life
1,"Maria Papademetri
You must listen to this. They shot dogs in Australia so people wouldn‚Äôt leave their homes to adopt. Much of what he is saying also took place when Stalin was in power. My mother told me of not being allowed to talk to anyone as they‚Äôre being told in Australia now."
1,"What about the next mandate? Do you really believe, after seeing this and Obamas birthday party, that these people are getting the vaccine? Or is it all for show so the masses are mandated? Vaccine is not mandated for the White House or Phizer employees."
2,"Power mad it‚Äôs dangerous, no caring or compassion for anyone . Very sick leaders"
2,"To be fair, it's NOT the federal government of Australia implementing these draconian lockdowns, it's the individual state leaders, over the last 19 months it's shown the the feds only collect taxes and defend the shores"
2,Democrats can do anything they Want to. It's EVERYONE else thay can't. Just remember if you're getting aeay with something there's always someone else going to get you!
1,People are ignoring reports like this and letting their fellow citizens be targeted and made to be criminals. Covid mandates and lockdowns are creating a reward system. Comply and we give you back your freedoms. Till they stop doing that too.
1,"Im in Queensland, Australia.
Certain States have different rules, Victoria is the most totalitarian, New south wales is a bit better, but stil mandating masks and forced vaccinations, but the other 4 states and 2 territories aren't in lock down.
There may be a 3 day lock down here and there if there are 30 ish cases, but it depends on how much of a Dictator the state health officer is"
2,Well we must love hypocrisy today. Because a lot of it is taking place right now and it seems like no one cares
2,The media here plays scenes of people at these rallies calling them selfish with the evil foreboding music in the background and then switch to hopeful uplifting music when showing people in line to get vaccinated calling them heroes.
2,"More Mandates are coming. If they can legally fire someone for not wanting to take the vaccine. Once they declare Global warming a crisis. Your travel will be greatly restricted.
Anyone in politics... regardless the political party they belong too. Should immediately be voted out of office. Sad to say... but for the most part. All of us on here are a systemic part of the problem. We get riled up but quickly calm down. Myself included."
2,We need to stand together & stand up for our rights!!
1,Who‚Äôs going to print the T-shirt‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a dangerous slacker cause a won‚Äôt wear a mask so shoot me‚Äù cause I will wear one. Totally not tasteful but the whole thing is beyond absurd and most Americans are beyond fed up and that also speaking up in defense also of this heinous crime too. The world has gone insane and it‚Äôs time to stand up!
1,"The only reason why I wear a mask, is because I can't afford the $200 ticket the police will give me here in Israel. It's horrible."
1,Shocking but so happy Tucker is speaking out!!! I hope ALL Americans watch this!!!
1,"I have great respect Tucker, and by no means agree with mask mandate. But they are at a table, outside, fixing to eat. Now how do you eat a 30k meal with a mask on. Even Republicans take them off to eat.
This is getting attention for silly reasons."
1,I can‚Äôt with all this. We are going to start killing dogs now because of covid. Society is sick.
1,It's time we stand strong against this bs! They cannot jail all of us o r get money from the poor? They cannot keep up with rules? Rules are made to be bent and laws are made to be broken as far as this ridiculous mandate goes
1,This is not some communist country -- this is AUSTRALIA! We canNOT let this happen here!
1,Who is giving these leaders these rules. They are obviously getting there rules from some higher authority and it definitely not the WHO it‚Äôs something else. This is a takeover of the world and people need to put politics aside and stand up against this tyranny!!!!
2,"""....the people making and enforcing the rules had no intention of following the rules"".........
YEP, that about sums it up right there"
1,Just like Obama's party they all know this is nonsense. They aren't saying so but they're demonstrating it very clearly all of them. They only put on masks for the TV camera.
2,Our mask mandates go into effect Thursday. Mask exceptions on the list: courts in session and meetings or sessions of the Nebraska Legislature üëÄ
2,"Not all Aussies are taking this lying down. Hence why there were thousands in Melbourne, lots in Queensland (who the police could only standby and watch because they were not in lockdown), and in Sydney. You‚Äôre affiliate in Australia (Skynews) is all over it and has a growing following. As you said, people will tolerate a little inconvenience but not hypocrisy."
1,"I can‚Äôt believe what I‚Äôm looking at. How can people accept being treated like prisoners being herded by thugs in uniform‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ all because of a bloody mask.
It is really sinister watching this. And listening to that New Zealand nut warning people not to talk to their neighbors. This has to stop while we can still stop it."
1,"Tucker Carlson Tonight, you‚Äôre not completely correct in your Australian report. Not all of Australia is under Marshall law, just New South Wales and I think Victoria. Queensland is at this point still reasonably free, but it won‚Äôt take much for us to go under either. Interstate travel is near impossible though."
1,The Delta variant is completely undetectable. There is no PCR test or rapid test that can pick up on the Delta variant. The only thing they can believe is that fear is going to drive people to believe that this is a powerful virus. The Delta variant is a weak mutation
2,"What doesn‚Äôt amaze me is that you have a very big crowd that can easily overpower the officers arresting just one individual, but instead of helping they would rather record and just feel like they are doing something ‚Äúimportant‚Äù. That‚Ä¶ is selfish and ignorant‚Ä¶ no, sorry, that‚Äôs selfish and stupid. My opinion of course."
0,"tucker - you stated tonight that gov. abbott refused to,send national guard t the border - not true. they are there now assisting border patrol in arrests. there have been other guard there as well from other states."
2,"Yikes, they had crazy Karen's back in those times too, but with loaded guns üò≥üò¨ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è....well this type of same hyprocrisy of rules for thee, but not for we happened at the G7 too, and there were videos of it documented so why are we all wearing masks again? üôÑ"
2,The world has gone mad!!!! So many people just don't see it. Governments certainly have hidden agendas!
2,"As much as I appreciate the service that our law enforcement provides to our communities, I also know that at any given moment they can turn their backs on me. Not only did we see this happening in several blue states, but now we are seeing it in Canada, New Zealand and now in Australia. If people continue giving these authoritarian politicians more power, and later realized their mistake, by then it will be too late."
2,Wow what BS from Australia. They do not want people talking to each other to expose the lies that are being perpetrated on people.
2,"We've seen what the ""elite""/
will be-- doing!! I pray it shakes us to the core and simply refuse to do ANY unconstitutional act. Those who blame our ""protectors"" that are daily putting their lives on the line for you, shame on you!! Who are answering YOUR calls for help?? The tooth fairy??"
2,"It's coming people, happening in Australia. When is enough is enough. It's time ""WE THE PEOPLE"" take our country back."
1,We would turn Afghanistan in to the greatest country on earth if they sent all the Maga wearing non vaccinated there.
2,She was caught at hair salon ask about it and said some excuse and that she would not talk about it Any further no one pressured her let it go thus will also go away - it‚Äôs their way but they tell u what to do but do as they please and we wonder why the country is divided.
2,"Gr8. Fearless Pelosi can saddle up wth Biden, Harris & the squad & go rescue people out of Afghanistan."
1,"That's what happens when Citizens give up their arms, they become subjects and serfs."
2,"I have a theory that those people freak out so much about that crap because they've lived such shityy lives like stealing from their constituents, their nations and all around being degenerates that they are almost certain they are going to hell so they are doing literally anything to stay alive. Also take notice that their police and I'm sure ours in America will have absolutely zero issue with just following their orders."
2,It's so sad to see that Australians are now facing pure totalitarian fascism! I lived in Australia - Adelaide - in 2000-2001 and I enjoyed the relaxed freedom of Australians then. This is politics turned amok!
0,Tucker Carlson will you be leaving Fox now that they are requiring vaccines for all staff? It seems the hypocrisy is t just in Washington if you stay.
2,"Feudalism is the society they want to bring back.
""he dominant social system in medieval Europe, in which the nobility held lands from the Crown in exchange for military service, and vassals were in turn tenants of the nobles, while the peasants (villeins or serfs) were obliged to live on their lord's land and give him homage, labor, and a share of the produce, notionally in exchange for military protection."""
0,Friggin hypocrites. This is unacceptable. Why isn't something being done about it. Gutless Republicans need to show this video in Congress.
1,Hey Tucker I love your work man and your courage . Am in NZ and yes our esteemed leader it seems was trained by the best tyrants .
2,WHEN SOME PEOPLE HAD COMMON SENSE AND THE NEWS MEDIA SOMETIMES PRESENTED THE TRUTH! So sad those times are completely gone.
2,To bust the system every protester needed to turn themselves in to law enforcement go to jail and bust the bank account making them feed them it's all about the money
2,When will people WAKE UP and realize the sheer HYPOCRISY of this madness?
1,"This is the Democratic Party. Dangerous and hypocritical. Preaching we must all wear face diapers, while they go unmasked. People are hopefully waking up to the insanity!"
1,Good for thee but not for me. They are only mandating masks to turn us against each other. This happened to me yesterday at the Vet office where I was viscously verbally attacked by a woman and told to put on a mask. I was unprepared for this attack as everyplace is really left to your own discretion in our city right now. The only thing I could muster was I don‚Äôt do masks. She sat on the other side of the room videoing me and the whole waiting room and will probably put it on social-media. -I really don't care. Picking on a 100 pound grandma wearing a huge back brace from my recent surgery is how you‚Äôll recognize me. I work on my health everyday of my life as I have autoimmune and back issues. I have felt great for the past 8 years and even more since this recent surgery. She needs to take a look in the mirror at what appeared to me to be a very overweight unhealthy individual and worry about herself. PS I still have the antibodies from Covid that I got while in the Holocaust museum filled with Chinese students here on their winter break before any of us had even heard of it. I was very ill for 10 days. PS- I LIVED!
1,"Tucker, our leader (the lady with the teethü§£)
Just so happens she was the elected President of 'The International Union of Socialist Youth'
You can see her political beliefs have not changed.
We are locked down with under 30 deaths to covid total. ü§¶"
2,Sounds like Australia needs to be liberated... send in the troops muhahaha
1,Australians let them take their guns a long time ago. Now they have no way to resist.
2,To bad the police are against their own fellow citizens. It‚Äôs hard to believe that the world is willing to give it all up so easily. I‚Äôm sure that soon the sleeping giant will wake up and heads will be hurt.
2,"Man, what the heck is happening to common sense and people standing up! So sad and disturbing!"
2,Politicians are and have always been more sophisticated than the rest of us tax paying types..
2,I like and Tustin to a lot of what you say. However. How about looking at the death rates and exposure rates. A fair bit better than USA and Great Britain. I think there‚Äôs something to learn there personally
1,"Covid-19 spike I'm Fl. Hmmm, could it be nc hundred s of illegal s were transport we there and was told the vaccine is OPTIONAL?!"
0,Good thing Australia already disarmed all there citizens.. lolz
0,"Just scary times. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª. Vaccinated and unvaccinated can still spread covid.
Forced vaccinations will hurt some. Medical exemptions have always been there for a reason. Common sense. Your doctor should help you decide this with informed consent. Some people think they are more important then others. No one deserves to die from covid. Access to antibody treatment should be available to everyone. It is humanity. No one is more important then another. I‚Äôm sad seeing this happen. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüíî. If anaphylaxis with first covid shot or obtain GBs or causes a stroke from blood clots. The injured then aren‚Äôt allowed in public places????? Because couldn‚Äôt get their card. Instantly. The weak physically are told it‚Äôs best for them to protect them. Scary. You stay home. Why I go out because I‚Äôm stronger physically then you. While they still spread the disease. It‚Äôs heartbreaking. üíî
If your vaccinated with a ‚Äúcold‚Äù. It can still be covid and you can still spread it.
Need to enforce SICk POLICIES regardless of vaccination status. Not just punish vulnerable populations.
Next we will see voting rights taken away if don‚Äôt have covid card. I predict this coming. Insanity. Scary times!!!! God help us all!!! üôèüèª"
2,Criminals in commissions of Crimes often wear mask too ‚ÄúNanny Nancy‚Äù.... During the Civil War Slaves did too when they had no voice as their‚Äôs were leather and iron.... Doubt it??? Research it!!!!!
2,"Our health official in Nevada County, California referenced the Spanish Flu and jokingly held up gun fingers.

Everyone is so mad!!! We have called for his resignation. Dr. Kellerman. And our Board of Supervisors refuse to fire him for saying that publicly."
1,George Travancoor that‚Äôs why our governor relaxed rules on owning a gun. I‚Äôll be ready for anyone that tries to force a mask or a shot on or in me.
2,"Do you notice how without a mask, Pelosi is still wearing a mask?"
1,"Australia is now in the grip of dictators, my once proud free democratic country, is no more. The next step will be a license to breath."
1,It does not become any clearer than seeing it with your own eyes . The elite and power hungry are slowly sacrificing the people of this country. The second amendment was put into place to fight tyranny and tyranny we are victims of until we decide to stop playing this game.
2,"Um as I recall, Kamala started the political anti vx movement when she said ‚ÄúBut if Donald Trump tells us we should take it, I'm not going to take it.""üí©"
2,"A million little restrictions can be accepted by so many, when they can‚Äôt stand back and see the big picture."
2,"So much for wanting to visit Australia, looks a lot like North Korea now . Never give up your guns, our politicians still fear us and that is a good thing ."
1,"That‚Äôs what happens when you freely give up your guns. Sadly, this is only the beginning in Australia"
2,"WOW! The New World Order has started in every country. The elite wealthy do what they want and the rest of us are a part of the collective. We are basically told to sit down and shut your mouth you are common folk, we are nothing!"
1,When we gonna stand up and just say no????? I don‚Äôt wear one even when asked I got the Johnson shot because my wife asked me to because of her job she takes care of the elderly as an administrator at a retirement home. But the people telling us we have to wear one a mask because it‚Äôs so deadly but don‚Äôt even believe it‚Äôs that deadly them selves
1,People can‚Äôt turn their heads anymore thinking nothing can happen here! It‚Äôs happening and Nancy is leadings it. She‚Äôs crazy.
0,They make the civil rights movement come back alive in a different way
2,My daddy said his mother told him stories of the government nailing doors shut to keep people indoors in the last pandemic. Did anyone else hear of this happening?
1,They gave up their guns and that's what happens!
1,"This said it all, look how brave our leaders are not fearing the virus"
1,It's not about a virus...if it was the borders would be closed. It's about control at this point...
1,I am Australian I can see the lunacy in this and millions of Australians do but we are powerless our government has also been hijacked by leftist communist ratbags and our police became the Gestapo overnight unbelievable
2,That‚Äôs because they are all brainwashed. If people would start standing up for our freedom and our rights.
2,"Yep, it‚Äôs nuts over here. Tucker Carlson Tonight in reference to the church gathering. They were dobbed on by people for meeting. The church was fined $5000 (AUD) for having no QR Code (Registered government digital contact tracing system) and 31 individuals were fined $1000 each. The NSW Police Commissioner also said he is considering closing down the church permanently."
1,Isn't that indicative of the fact that something is going on. And you can bet that the folks in power had protection before this virus was released.
1,The government stole Australians‚Äô guns for a reason.
2,Leaders create this chaos then blame the cops who they force to control it. Notice their hands stay clean.
1,"Don't post this just on social sides post this on her page LoL.. if this would be a pandemic and be so dangerous and all this drama this witches (B) saying it is, there are the ones who would be in a bunker .. this is a control game and why is no one shows her or who ever get cut this pictures and late them explain it to us WTF THEY THINK THEY DOING .. EXPLAIN THIS where is the Covid .. so much BS makes my head spin.. and ppl believe all this covid crap"
2,Frightening how the sheep follow along... Australia is so far gone... we're not far behind.
1,But the first thing the government did in Australia is take their guns. Now they have no power to resist.
2,Why is this being tolerated by the masses??! We out number them.
2,"Those videos from Australia apply to Victoria and NSW, Most states aren't locked down, and it's certainly not nationwide. Having said that, people in Australia are pissed off about lockdiwns because the federal government refuses to address the continual leaks from hotel quarantine that are causing covid to spread."
1,"Im from Melbourne and i can confirm that this is all true, leaving your house will get you a $5000 fine but because people arnt paying the fine the government now wants to seize property to make up for it, its insane"
2,What is a ‚ÄúMild Protestant‚Äù
2,The ‚Äúslacker‚Äù who was shot was maskless in the street and a health inspector led him to a store to get a mask when the slacker hit him over the head and started beating him. The inspector shot in self defense. Both received charges. Google is free yall
1,"Terry Leef Abood you might like this. What's good for the goose isn't necessarily good for the gander. Really ticks me off seeing Pelosi and the rest trying to control my life. ""We the people"" are forgotten and in some ways dying needlessly to further their agenda."
2,They really shouldn‚Äôt be rich these dark elements in society they should prove and justify or go the hell to jail
1,the democrats are going to try and push this until the vote in 2022 mail in vote is the only way to win
2,"Where are these people who consider themselves "" elite "" going to run when the Country finally cones after them?
Like the mafia, there won't be anywhere that they can hide to escape the punishment that they brought upon themselves"
1,"America does not leave Americans behind Nor do we play nice guy with the enemy.
This is a posture of weakness. We will do what ever it takes . Stand Up Americans Wake Up
What this Administration is doing is Outrageous!!! I'm asking for the President and the administration to Resign. Get out of the way!!! If they don't do what it takes to remove them immediately Congress Republicans,Dem
ocrats & Independents Do your job !!! The Military can take care of this Listen to the Veterans who fought there.
God Bless Our Military and Veterans
2 Chronicles 7:14"
0,"Your reporting on Australia is in accurate. I am currently in Queensland where there is no Covid 19 and no restrictions, this is the same for many states. Sydney however has had an out break of Covid 19 D the state there is trying to get it under control, thus no large gatherings. The protesters were told not to go, as gatherings spread Covid. They went there with the intent to break the laws. We have been fortunate in Australia to avoid deaths from Covid and are proud to say only a few deaths not 1000s of deaths that followed uncontrolled riots like the US. Perhaps the way fwd would be to tell protesters they are banned from wearing masks then they would protest that by wearing a mask."
2,Sounding more and more like Nazi Germany by the day.
1,"If the video was in black and white, it would mimic a party on a plantation held by the good ole Southern Democratic Segregationist Party!"
1,It gives me the message that it's having trouble playing this video. This is not the first conservative video I have not been able to view on Facebook today. I think they are censoring again.
2,I can‚Äôt believe people still believe any of this show!!!!!! It‚Äôs disgusting and people need to start asking questions!!! Wake up!
2,Vote these people out of office that is how we will take the country back . Get out and vote in your local elections they are more important than we think ......
1,It‚Äôs insane my siblings live in Sweden and are in the medical field they stated they did not have tons off deaths and did not wear masks so again insanity
1,"The hypocrisy has turned into madness, thanks to the left. As usual there are no rules or laws that apply to the ruling class."
2,we all must stand together against any so called ‚Äúruling class‚Äù ‚Ä¶
2,The police in these countries need to turn on there leaders....
2,Nancy seems to be remembering the issues for the 1918 pandemic
1,Unbelievable that they still have Dr. Fauci on TV and people are again hanging on to every word he says. God help us all! Only God can save us now. Keep praying everyone! Evil will not Prevail!!
1,Government officials police and the military are now Australian super spreaders each time they speak they spread covid
2,"For those of us, who had such a hard time understanding of how the german people before ww2, could allow the insane nazis to get into control, now we know!. All it takes for evil to triumphant, is for good people to do NOTHING!. America better wake up, because we are next!. - Mark"
2,"Ok Biden can save hime self.and amercians,, The talaban is not the legt government of afganistan so launch a drone and take out all leaders of taliban and put legt government back in place."
1,Australia has gone full blown communist.
1,"Never, ever give up your guns / weapons."
1,I bet Australians wish they fought to keep their guns years ago.
1,"South Australian here, yea the states under labor control (the leftards or democrats) who have imposed the most ridiculous lock downs and rules ironically have the worst daily case numbers in our country.. im in south Australia, and we are going to work, myself in civil construction, and dont have to mask up unless being inside a shop or the likes.. its the left wing ideology thats proven to be no help, but scare and anger the people.."
0,All good here Ellen is 6 weeks or so we will be 70-80% vaccinated and things should go back to normal. It‚Äôs stressful but at least we don‚Äôt have to look back.
1,"Thank you Tucker for reporting what is happening in NZ & Australia, you are a brave man, may God bless you and keep you always"
1,Only reason the population of Australia put up with a shutdown is Australian government took all the firearms. That is why we need to fight this government and keep them from taking away the second amendment.
2,Notice those in England and Australia who are enforcing these mask mandates and lockdown are not doing the same. No masks on either
2,Tucker it's the same in Ireland üáÆüá™ the elite politicians doing the same but no vaccinated can only dine outdoor.no pass no entrance to be seated in pubs and restaurants
2,This is China all over. CCP. They do the same to their people. Such a huge overlap.
2,"Tucker, don't you know these are all sophisticated, vaccinated people that are all above us servants who are the super spreaders of the world."
2,God help us. People must take control back before this happens to us. I shudder to think what kind of life my grandchildren have to look forward to IF we don‚Äôt stop this insanity NOW!!!!
1,"Have you noticed, if you watch this on utube , it is edited! Why? The pictures are filled in with Donald Trump in the corner, not the videos/ picture of What Tucker is talking about like the Pelosi gathering without masks. Why edited?"
1,We're being conditioned to accept rules for the surfs but not for the elites. That's why they keep throwing it in our faces.
2,I was just going to say that! During Spanish flew everyone covered up. Then WW1 ended and it kinda disappeared. Everyone masked .
2,"They break their own rules every..single..
time. Stand up or this will never end. Please wake up before its too late and we're doing what Australia and New Zealand are doing"
1,Australians getting arrested for going outside
2,"On balance adequate. The footage shot in Australia is illuminating, however; you did not emphasize that the Australians are putting up a fight--American
s are not."
2,"Your life means nothing to them and they will
Kill you just for the heck of it so You Might as well die fighting for freedom of your loved ones and üôèüíûüõêüá∫üá∏ and pray like never before"
2,"Unless your Obama and his guests i presume!!. Or any of the worlds elite, including Johnson and his hypocritical colleagues here in the UK."
2,"Tucker has been vaccinated...he
spewed his venom over that too. He's got nothing else to vomit about. Speaking of servants, how's that silver spoon taste Tucker? Nice name."
1,"Hypocrisy at its finest! they DEMAND of us, doesn‚Äôt apply to them! The thinking of leaving our American boarders WIDE OPEN is an open invitation to thousands more Covid in Texas and elsewhere! Sam Gonzales Lydia Gonzales De Vasquez what are your thoughts? Lisa Cavazos Darras Lisa Daniels Feldman"
2,"And yet nothing happens, evil is ruling, this seems like God's judgment"
2,"I have always thought Australia was one in kind with Canada discounting the weather. We here in Canada have seen similar instances in Toronto and Montreal. My main point is, are the police not there to protect and serve the people? This whole thing, even if there actually is a pandemic why brutalize your own! Nothing about these times follow any kind of straight lines. Rule changes at every turn, they say follow the science without any consultation or debate. Science now is what the government leaders say it is. Having had the illness is the best defence from ever getting it again, but that‚Äôs not very profitable and if they can break down your natural immunity with a few jabs well you might just be the next casualty and that‚Äôs worth a few bucks. To say I‚Äôm dissolutions by what has happened is putting it mildly. Well we will March on."
2,Politicians are famous for hypocrisy. This dingbat is on top of the list.
1,I think we‚Äôre all in denial this is communism. We all need to wake up
2,Didn‚Äôt Australians give up their guns awhile back?
1,"The Australian stuff sounds a lot like life here in Manitoba, until last month! Things are quite normal now, by comparison, but employers and schools are mandating vaccination. Sone of us are quite concerned about how that will play out. I think that just refusing will probably be enough. They can't legally compel us"
1,"FACT Check Tucker Carlson Tonight, ‚ÄúNo one is Australia is laughing at this, no one in Australia is standing back far enough and seeing the lunacy on display‚Äù is incorrect!!! It is a minority but there are many of us who are not happy at all and seeing how crazy Australia has gone! The country of freedom has disappeared and now it‚Äôs communist Australia üá¶üá∫ Very sad‚òπÔ∏è üò¢"
0,"That's funny why Carlson didn't say something when the Governor of Texas, Florida and Atlanta stop wearing mask and you see what is happening. So let's see what will happen."
1,It's because they can't have guns for defense.
2,"Hypocrisy has reached new heights in america and unacceptable.

We do not bow to the politicians who are supposedly elected to serve.

Today's out and have lost their way and believe they are designated through elections to rule.

Time to remove and fire those who believe politicians rule american citizens.

Goes against american tried and true values no matter how many statues antifa and BLM topple"
1,"Peslosi drops her participles. üò¨ üòä On that basis alone she can never be presidential material. Ironically enough, I really do mean this. It only takes a modicum of education. Otherwise one speaks like a fool. üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
0,"Probably exactly the same. See:
Sweden.

Go get vaccinated or mask or whatever or stay home.... and leave me the hell alone to live my life the way I choose to live it."
2,"Here in australia i believe OUR
TRUCKIES are planning a NATIONWIDE stopage within the week. People are preparing for the LONGHAUL stocking up on provisions. As the strike rolls on i sincerely hope they prove to be the much needed thorn in the states sides. We cant go on like this. Its TAKE SERIOUS ACTION OR DIE ON OUR KNEES."
2,The Police can not be trusted anymore. when they know they are breaking the law and they attack citizens they are paid tyrants period. It will all come to a civil war in all of these countries. Its coming sooner than than you think.
2,"Also, in Australia rescue dogs were SHOT & KILLED recently to prevent people from coming to adopt them, & therefore according to the Australian government, risking spreading covid.... He talks about this in this video..."
2,"These elected hypocritical establishment figures all were caught in 2009 with the UBS Bank scandal that exposed them as having 52, 000 bank accounts not paying tax
... Anytime a US politician bureaucrat or elite go to Davos for a climate meeting they're selling influence and profiting in their offshore bank account where nobody can see it."
2,"Tucker, you keep this up and they‚Äôre going to put you in the same box with Trump. She will be tearing up your ‚Äúaddress to the nation‚Äù speech behind your back with clenched dentures."
2,What the hell is going on??? Why would people allow their country to do this???????
1,yes it is pretty bad in Australia at the moment I live in Victoria and in the last year and a half we have been in lockdown for over 200 days prisoners in our own homes you are allowed to go to the shops Within five k‚Äôs for essential items and you are allowed to go to work if you are considered an essential worker it is pretty depressing Feels like I have wasted the last year and a half of my life gotten absolutely nowhere done nothing that is why there was protests over the weekend because a lot of us are about to snap yeah this is not the Australia I grew up in it is hard to watch it‚Äôs not right
2,You know they are going to say they were all vaccinated and they were eating so it‚Äôs okay! üòÜ
2,"So so Terrible Sad! I‚Äôve been to Australia- I love Australia! Well I did, They‚Äôve done lost their minds. So sad for the people of Australia üá¶üá∫"
2,Breach of decorum lol... where's the picture of the forefathers wearing their masks while signing the declaration of independence...
2,"Ah, they have a cure for it they're not giving to the public. Think about it, we all know it's real. Her and the rest of these leaders aren't one bit scared of it. Why not? Why worry about us if they don't worry about themselves?"
2,Hardly a diverse crowd amongst the non help either... not really seeing many border crossers welcome.
2,"The scary thing is, is that here in Australia the media, ALL MSM is demonising the protesters.
They are giving them outrageous negative publicity.
These are the people that are going to save us, not hinder us.
THE PEOPLE ARE BRAINWASHED!"
2,So according to Pelosi all the men at her fund raiser are not real men!!!üòπü§≠
2,"No covid cases so far in the south island, New Zealand yet is still at the level 4 lockdown where only grocery stores, gas stations and hospital emergency services are open. That applies too in the North Island where the covid case was found and spread rapidly within 1 week since the lockdown started. Its the delta variant"
2,"Bandits behind the mask. Better watch out and stay precarious if you are in high crime and hatred state.
Take care of yourself and family. üôèüôèüôè"
1,"Something very evil corrupts these elite puppets thinking and it's dangerously obvious THEY ARE OWNED. Goe Hiden has been on his knees three times?? WHAT IN ""HELL"" HAS ERUPTED??? ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨üêâüêâüêâüêâüêâüêâüêâ"
2,I just don‚Äôt understand how these people get away with lying so much specially right in your face like she just did. How are they getting away with this and not being held responsible that‚Äôs what we need to know??If that was me I‚Äôd be fined or jailed for that.
2,Wow didn't see the people serving wearing masks... I guess I shouldn't be shocked
2,Why not just put their feet down don‚Äôt send them to the collages which also means not giving ANY money to the colleges and they will be in turn shut down can‚Äôt run a college with teachers if no money coming in along with no students to teach ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è makes sense to me
2,Will history repeat itself? Will Americans wake up to the power grabbing of its elected officials and return to making their own informed decisions?
1,"Notice New Zealand is being told that they have learned from other countries around the world that you can get Covid from just walking past somebody. What study did they get that information from? What other country did they learn that from? Or is New Zealanders being lied to?
Each country is telling their people something different to continue the lies fear and control."
1,Australians are ready for Chinese rule
1,And those who don't bring Pelosi ice-cream from her ice-cream fridge will be slaves to her forever.
1,Shame they don‚Äôt have guns. Pretty sure this would he handled very differently if they did.
2,"Please do a story on Washington state before it‚Äôs to late !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!"
1,"As someone has posted, takes more to enter a restaurant than to cross our borders.."
2,"Those in power know what they are doing is nothing less than stripping citizens of their RIGHTS, and if enough stupid people allow it, all will eventually have to submit."
1,"You notice The Prime Minister isn't wearing a mask, one rule for some another rule for others."
1,I believe in the 1918 pandemic that mask mandate was stopped because it was proven that it caused respiratory problems
2,"That is a bit excessive, it's people's stupid fear that allows this to happen"
1,Pelosi should have been required to wear a mask long before the coronavirus ever came along
1,But the mask police will say you can‚Äôt eat or drink with a mask on‚Ä¶
1,He's another communist it's all right and that's the rest of her cohorts including Joe and Pamela Harris.
2,"I agree with Schwarzenegger.
‚ÄúScrew your ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô. Because with freedom comes obligations and responsibilitie
s.‚Äù"
2,Some people in America is doing the same thing. Just going along with these crazies in Washington DC. WHY?
2,"Did the same thing when government banned alcohol, they installed underground cellers under government buildings to hide there booze, hell even had one under white house."
2,WTH tucker??? Where's the Afghanistan coverage????
1,If the ceo of Pfizer won‚Äôt take his own vaccine what does that tell you? If the CDC does not force its employees to take the shot! No one in Biden‚Äôs admin is forced to take the shot! What the hell does that tell you????
1,And people are willing to mask our children... disgusting and evil.
2,Totaliterism at its worst. So sad for the Australian peoples. My people too.
1,You know I don‚Äôt want to share air with palosi either. Can she hold her breath please?
2,"If one is paying attention, they can see the parallels being drawn between Australia and the United States. I fear that by the time Americans decide to do something about it, it will be just as Tucker is saying here - it will be too late."
2,How it should be now. Keep seeing the uppities massless and post all across the nation pics! Then maybe some people will wake up and stop the bah bah like a sheep
1,Saw that last night. She is one of the rich elite Demonrats. Not the peon worker bees like the rest of us.
1,Biden is full of it and why people listen to him is beyond me. 1st off Florida is not full of Covid with people dying left and right. Biden just doesn't like Governor DeSantis!
2,At our local school board meeting last night one father striped down to his undies and mask to make his point. He felt everyone should have to wear a mask. He said if others did not have to wear a mask he did not have to wear clothes.
0,"‚ÄúIf you are not a scientist, and you disagree with scientists about science, it's actually not a disagreement. You're just wrong.‚Äù"
2,"Who does Pelosi think she is Gov. Whitmer from Michigan, None of the rules have applied to her."
1,"Rules for the masses and not for the elite!
Communism, socialism continues, look at all the examples worldwide."
2,"It‚Äôs coming to America, another shut down will be here because you know, it worked the first time!üò†"
2,We must rebel hit the streets just whe the Holiwood dummies got on the streets wearing pink horn hats .Just because Trump was elected .other wise we submit to the political mafia
0,"Wait, those Aussie cops aren't social distancing! ü§®"
2,I never laughed so hard in my life but this so called president and his minions come out of a cartoon they need to be impeached and gone.
1,This absolute BS must stop. Arm yourselves because it looks like we are going to need to overthrow our sadistic ‚Äúleaders.‚Äù
2,I think she is joining the president with mental issues and don‚Äôt remember what she says from one min to the next
2,I didn't see one person of color except the servers . Wow talk about a perfect picture of the hypocrisy from the elite
2,"Just say, ""NO"". They can't pass a law that they, themselves aren't subject to. Frauds, the lot of them!"
1,"Wear masks, take the jab, keep social distance, but don't forget the next wave is on its way. Keep it up citizens you are doing well with your communism course. Mind training is hard but you wil get there."
1,First thing I notice is not one person of color at Pelosi's fund raiser. Not one. So tucker ask the Squad why is that.
2,Mark Helmick He speaks of New Zealand's lockdown over 1 covid death and Australian lockdown. Martial law like I have only seen in old military videos.
2,All of her guests are also well into the risk zone age.
2,"Ok for me but not for thee! Control of us peons is the name of their game! When are we going to wise up to their hypocrisy, like the people did in the past!"
1,"What's that old saying what's that old saying do as I say not as I do, what gets me so mad cuz they got all these people coming in on the southern border no mask all these people from Afghanistan no mask and yet their own people they're making mandatory mask üò∑üé≠"
1,Stop arguing about masks and look at HR 4. They‚Äôre trying to take away states rights to require voter ID!
2,"I'm convinced that many of these cops are frustrated schoolyard bullies who couldn't cut it on the playground.

Bear in mind that all these illegal and tyrannical mandates would be pointless and impotent if COPS didn't enforce them. Let that sink in."
1,"This entire Administration is acting like an Aristocracy.
I think they are forgetting what happened to the last one who tried to rule our lives. Remember King George.
If I was a Democratic hippocrate I would be very afraid.
It just took only 75,000 Taliban soldiers to run us out of Afghanistan.
What do you think half the Country could do to Washington if they continue to attempt to rule us like a Monarchy."
1,Thank you Tucker Carlson Tonight for talking about the madness in Australia üôè Next week our truckies are going on protest blocking highways to voice their opinion on mandatory vaxx to cross borders.
0,Bet them aussie are really happy about giving up their guns now.
2,"I'm Sorry but I have to say something about this sound off of information about our countries leaders about the covid situation and what is in jeopardy here. BUT DID ANYONE ELSE HEAR THE REFERENCE TO THE SERVERS AT THAT $30,000 DOLLAR PLATE SPEACH ??? SOUNDED TO ME LIKE MR. CARLSON TUCKED IN THE WORDS OF "" BROWN SERVERS "" TWICE IN HIS REPORT ON THIS MATTER..
I DON'T MIND HIS REPORTS BUT I BELIEVE THAT HIS REPORTS NEED PROOFREADING BEFORE GOING ON THE AIR.
THIS REPORT WAS GOOD BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER."
2,Why are people not rising up!
1,"Please, tell me when they are going to ""finally"" start investigating ""Nancy Pelosi, the State of California and the office of the Speaker of the House?"
1,PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBWR- MANDATES ARE NOT LAWS!! This is all about CONTROL!!!!!!
1,Here in Victoria Australia we are not allowed to drink alcohol without a mask. Go figure it is not the air but a corporate regime for us to obey the words of the corporate elite nothing more nothing less. Sad really.
2,Australia is a penal colony again.
2,This was a long time coming. The new normally has been brought to you by the Old normal. Repent! Which means think differently.
1,Nor That woman have on a mask.. Why isn't anyone challenging these people. The news media aren't 6ft and none wears a mask inside.. yet not a sound.
1,the Australians made a mistake when they trusted the government and turned over their weapons
2,Repeating history of Nazi Germany... American people need to rise against this tyranny
1,"Im glad Jason Whitlock said it. Im glad someone finally said it. Its ALL satanic. Politics, entertainment, communism, LGBTQ, wokism, marxism; it all flies in the face of Christianity all the while they attack Christians of bigotry while never explaining a single instance. The Left attacks the opposition with the very thing they are doing. As soon as Jason said it, I was like THANK YOU!"
2,"The exact number of taxpayers dollars
85 BILLION in weapons, Aircraft,Unifor
ms,and Transport Vehicles. All left behind and someday they will be used against us!"
2,"It's a representation of how it's us and them. The workers are wearing masks but the others are too good for that, even though they preach it. They aren't even hiding what they're doing anymore!"
2,"Hey Tucker, love your show but you got it wrong about Aussie bloke sneezing in lift. Remember TYPHOID MARY - they locked her up in isolation for 20 years because she refused to isolate. This bloke is contagious and refuses to quarantine or self isolate. So I have no problem with them locking him up in forced quarantine (comparison to FEMA camps etc is a bit silly, really. It is just 2 weeks isolation which many countries are enforcing, and if he cops a fine or jail term for breaking the law, so what). Yes our Govt is insane, but that's because, unlike most of the world, they are still aiming for ZERO COVID, which is rapidly slipping through their inept fingers. And high school kids were NOT forced to vaccinate without parents in a stadium - it was totally voluntary, and many opted to not vaccinate. There is enough crap going on in the world to expose, without hyping stuff up - it just diminishes your credibility. Disappointed, but still a big fan :)"
1,So why is it the self ordained elites dont wear protection at public venues as Obama & his cronies did at his 60th B-day party on Martha's vineyard recently? What do they know that we dont? Hmm? What the hell is going on? Wake up Americans!
2,Canada is a few weeks away from the same gvt behavior.
1,The VP goes to S E Asia? I guess there really isn't a pandemic. Ignoring the border and ignoring the Americans trapped in Afghanistan.
1,PLEASE! a start going after the ‚Äúdo-nothing‚Äú Republicans to draft articles of impeachment against the entire Biden administration and Nancy Pelosi. They must go
2,It's very true and iv seen more of this stuff going on all over the world and its dictatorship plain and simple and people need to waik up alredy before it's to lait
2,notice none of those marching were armed
1,Notice all the leaders are not wearing maks while telling everyone to wear them or else
1,"Yeah, that‚Äôs why no one at the event in which Pelosi was speaking were wearing masks, except the servers."
2,Time for the people to take back their countries!!
2,Any guesses as to gun laws in these two countries? Wake up folks
1,I refuse to wear a mask or stay home‚Ä¶ I will wash my hands and not get close to anyone‚Ä¶.. I have lives with someone who had it and even was in the Covid unit for 8 hours while my vaccinated uncle died‚Ä¶. I will NOT comply! Th was cops who are ‚Äúenforcing‚Äù this üí© need to grow a backbone!
2,I‚Äôve watched people argue over whether or not Mr. Rogers would get the üíâ. Like... üëÄü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ok? ü§Øü§Øü§ØüíÄüíÄüíÄ Are we really that far gone? Please tell me I am not a part of this generation. Please tell me it‚Äôs all a dream. üòÖ
2,"They‚Äôre eating, though. We all have learned by now that the virus is afraid of food and drinks. It miraculously disappears when you bring out those things. Duh üôÑüòÇ"
2,I thought Australians were supposed to be tough people next they'll have you walk into an oven and you'll walk right in
2,Australia was once a penal colony!
1,Think about this she didn't like Trump so she is the one leaving our military behind she knows Trump loves them just like she undone the border knowing he was tring to fix it everything he was about she undone this is all control in all countries covid is coming around again do to all the one's that's been vaxed month's ago this is why they push the shots
1,did that NZ woman just say that the delta variant can be passed on to other people by simply walking next to that person? is she insane? where the hell are those studies everyone believes? no wonder people are scared to even open the window and get this flu....what a bunch of nonsense
2,New Zealand has a bunch of crapNew Zealand and Australia those people are idiots they're scared to death now that's cuz they're
2,"‚ÄúFreedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.‚Äù Ronald Reagan
Hmmm is San Francisco reistaling that law? Asking for a friend.
‚ÄòSerious breach of decorum‚Äô ?? Isn‚Äôt that the equivalent of eating a salad with the big fork?!? Everything I ever needed to know about Pelosi can be boiled down to her ‚Äòhair salon‚Äô incident from 2020, where she got caught with her pants down and claimed ‚Äòit was a set up!‚Äô Stick it, Nancy. What a trashy human being.
New Zealand is run by a woke communist its sad
The hipocracy though it's disgusting and appalling is not New or a Surprise!! On the plus side we can be happy they will ALL go down in history as liers, cheaters, hypocrites and crooks!!! My opinion of course.
Love your work Tucker Carlson Tonight but, we have 8 states in Australia, not every state is in lockdown, they like to take it in turns ü§£ currently NSW and Victoria are in lockdown, a couple of other states just have a mask mandate whilst indoors but you are free to move around, as long as you dont want to move around your country as most borders are shut and wont let you in.üôÑ
If there is anyone on this thread who can help New York go RED for Governor in 10 months.....plea"

1,"stionable election results!"""
1,"This is the women who fines The house of representatives
$500 for not wearing a mask."
2,Are media using the word servant on purpose?
2,too far gone America on it's way at warp speed
1,Obama had a Birthday party with possibly 600 guests of the rich and famous type and nobody wore masks. Mandates don't really apply to the elite in the democrat party or to some of their RINO friends because the mask mandate is about having power and control over others. The jews were forced to wear a yellow star on their clothing when outside.
2,"Decorum???
So they admit mandates are purely a matter of ‚Äúgood taste‚Äù, ‚Äúpolite behavior‚Äù, and/
noun
the state or quality of conforming to conventionally accepted standards of behavior or morals.

And has nothing to do with actual necessities??? üòí"
2,They shot rubber bullets point blank range (1m 2m distance) at that demonstration btw
2,Create civil wars so the Cabal can sell armaments...
1,"This is a dystopian world where servants wear a mask, and look all the same, while the privilege look down on them. Handmaidens tale."
2,"Look at it still way .
Being out doors yes less chances of getting the virus ,after having the covid vaccine.
Being indoors more chances of catching the virus."
2,Jeff Shortridge. Watch the end of this video where the police turn on Australian citizens. This will be America soon. Don‚Äôt put to much blind faith in the police. Support them but keep an open eye
2,they're at a table outside...who cares..we traveled all over last year..no one cares if your dining out and your at your table.....a stretch to try and stir the pot.....i'm sure you follow every law to the letter....mask and distancing should apply to only to the unvaccinated.
2,"Chaos caused by evil control.
This is all a sham
We will not allow them to take power from us!"
0,but pelosi can have a big party and not wear a mask. am glad that the waiters did because they could have been infected with all her lies
2,yes and is Canada reaching out to them and rescuing those people I guess they're not Justin's people losing its Justin's people winning
2,"pelosi is just the messenger?
get the big boss who orders these things?"
2,"What about her & other government, big pharma reps like Fauci wearing muzzles?"
1,the question I must ask is WHY are these police enforcing this ideocracy?
2,"Have a listen to Tucker esp. the person that posted on my Comments a couple of months ago ""do you really think mandates can happen""?"
2,Erika Loren what do you have to say about the people you support being so hypocritical? Especially ones in such a high-risk group?
1,So quick question. Based on the limited video. Does this event violate any of the mandates in place in that area?
2,Where‚Äôs old nana Pelosi on the debacle that is the Afghanistan withdrawal? ü§êüò¥
2,"Don't you just love the verbiage they're using to control people? It's not spreading...it'

2,"Hey bring me my food peasant,and don't spread your Germs you Germs.
Power Hungry Totalitarian politicians in Australia must be Stopped.
Freedom Forever.
Please help us America we ‚ù§Ô∏èyou."
2,"The whole of Australia does not agree with this, trust me we are angry. We do not consent. I am horrified that they killed those dogs. At first I thought it must be a mistake, there must be another reason, but no they killed them to stop people moving between 2 country areas. Heartbreaking. These charges are all dismissed in court too, police were caught on a hot mic admitting that the rules were BS."
1,Australia is just working on getting ahead of the curve in becoming part of Oceania out of Orwell's 1984. Tyranny is cool! ü§¨
2,Don't let Biden or who is running the goverment to touch anything else all he does just withers and dies he is leaving a trail of stink and slug
2,These videos are starting to remind me of news clips off of movies like robocop and v for vendetta etc its so surreal...
2,"They all feel like they rule this country,not work for it"
2,"""the public was able to endure inconvenience, but not hypocrisy"".

It was true then, but not so much today. Fully half this country are sleazy hypocrites. It's not just leaders that you've shown us, I've seen dozens of pictures of liberal friends partying without masks. Recently, when they were publicly chastising people for not wearing them.

I did not hear that the Australian Police State shot and killed dogs merely to stop people from travelling to rescue them That's disgusting, and I know that liberals here would love that. They don't care about dogs, about kids, about race, about anything other than themselves and their own power"
1,now if they want to play this crap ok then what if AMERICA decides too demand this then. if any server serving my food or any one in a store we need too see there papers of any other kind of health issues . cold flu any thing they need papers showing they are either sick or just getting over or other kind of sickness they had or do have.
2,Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear had to pull his mask order because he was caught at the state fair rubbing elbows with his pals without mask and no social distancing.

Imagine Larry elder trying to defend his record next year, which would undoubtedly be super unpopular. He‚Äôd lose re-election for sure. However, if he wins this recall, it will be good for the GOP nationally because they can push propaganda saying how even ‚Äúcrazy commiefornia‚Äù was fed up with democrats and chose a Republican governor (despite the fact that he can win the recall election without a majority of the state‚Äôs votes). They will use this as evidence to push the party further right and it will help them fundraise in other states, the logic being that if democrats are even too crazy for California, then they‚Äôre clearly too crazy for states like Missouri or Ohio. We really can‚Äôt let that happen. We‚Äôve got to prove to middle America that our candidates are far more reasonable and pragmatic and that the extremists are the republicans"

He would be a disaster, even if we only have to deal with him for a year and a half, that‚Äôs a year and a half too long. But I expect him to announce his 2022 candidacy for governor very quickly after he loses the recall, and in that election, he‚Äôs going to get a lot of help from establishment republicans across the country, more than he‚Äôs getting now"

2,"I don't know about lazy... we have a higher proportion of individuals either prevented from voting, or for whom voting is more difficult."
0,"In California, a recall election can be put into motion solely by getting a petition signed by a proportion of state citizens equal to or greater than 12% of the number of voters in the previous office election. As such, to force a recall election of Gavin Newsom--who won with 62% of the vote in 2018--only required 1.4 million signatures, or 3.5% of California's population. The recall is costing California $276 million and represents an attempted power grab by Republicans to take advantage of a non-regular election to unseat the democratically-elected governor.

According to the law, the recall is based on two questions: question one is a yes or no question about recalling Gavin Newsom, and question two is who would replace him were the yes vote to receive a plurality of the vote. So, technically, 3.5% of the population forces the other 96.5% to turn out in an irregular election to vote ""no"" by a plurality, or the most popular ""other"" candidate running (currently Republican Larry Elder with about 26% popularity) becomes governor. If a plurality votes ""yes,"" regardless of who they prefer, a candidate with less than 30% popularity can supplant the governor elected with over twice that popularity during a standard, regular election."
2,Yeah but they‚Äôre more motivated to turn out than the Democratic voters :/

Only 65 signatures need to start the drive to recall and only 12% of the total votes counted in the last election needed for the recall to proceed. FWIW, Newsom beat his last opponent by 24%. However at 12.5 million votes cast, only 1.5 million needed for a recall to proceed. It gives the GOP a second bite at every election if they choose to take it. Seriously broken.  


I urge all California, left, right and center, not to sit this one out."
0,"The reason they got 12% of voters to sign is because Covid extended their time to get signatures by 3 months. So they simultaneously bitch about Covid measures and owe it to Covid measures that they got a recall at all. 

12% of voters shouldn't be able to waste the time of the other 88% with this bullshit."
0,"You are amazing for doing this. Is there anyone else you can call? You seem to be a trusted voice of reason. 

&x200B;

This also reminds me of Nov. 4th. I had to call my aunt the day before to ask her if she is voting. She wasn't going to because my cousin (her daughter) always goes with her but had to work. I told her I'll stay on the phone with her while she waits in line, thank goodness I was working from home halfway across the country. So I listened to her random stories for an hour after calling 3 times to get her out of the house to the polls and sending her the polling location. 

She lives in NV so it was 100% worth the effort to get another vote for Biden. Then i convinced my exhausted cousin to stop at her polling place after pulling a double at work. +2 votes for Biden in NV! 

Seeing how close NV was warmed my heart for my little cross country voter outreach."
2,"Wow, you're amazing!  That's so great!  We all need to do this!  Thanks for being a good citizen!"
2,"Because campaigning on the importance of No is that important.

Last time they lost during the recall, in part, because they promoted a candidate"
0,The black Trump    - The guy is the equivalent of a Jewish Nazi.
2,You Mean to tell me that in California a blue state that‚Äôs been blue for a long time that has some of the loosest voting laws in the country is disproportionally making it harder for blue voters to vote? You have even said everyone has a ballot MAILED to them. And you have plenty of places to vote. Tell me how is it hard to vote? It almost seems hard not to vote yet you are convinced it is still hard for people? Which people are disproportionately affected? I genuinely want to know.
0,I‚Äôve been telling my friends like crazy. Some ignore me but get through to some. My friend told me that they didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal. I hope people turn out in drones because every Republican is surely going to vote yes on the recall.

No minimum wage. He's said we should give reparations to the families of slave owners for their lost property (slaves)"

0,"Those Govenors bear some responsibility.

We cannot blame the Federal government, we blame the 70 million selfish rural Trumpers who refuse to get vaccinated and shed the virus to innocents. Now the kids are dying.

This is squarely the fault of self-centered conservatives who back the big lie. Now they are in the hospital begging for help.

They should be shamed off the planet and Republicans must all be beaten in 2022."
0,"Vaccines for kids, yes. Boosters for immune compromised, the elderly etc, yes. But beyond that, we really need to start sending hundreds of millions of doses overseas. We really need to get global COVID cases under control, all those open the door for new mutations, any one of which could end up being fully resistant, sending us right back to square one."

2,"Spend a little time here and it may, unfortunately, deplete any empathy in the most empathetic of people. [

Over and over and over it's the same thing. Past posts from people saying it's about control or freedom or whatever nonsense of the day, followed by the hospitalization and call for ""Prayer Warriors,"" then the death announcement followed by the standard Go Fund Me page. Mind blowing.

It's the Dad's leaving kids behind that's really hard for me take. Can't wrap my head around it."
0,Biden is a gentle transparent decent man. He is a refreshing change. We are lucky to have him now.
2,The administration could do a MUCH BETTER job of squelching misinformation. Why don't they?
0,"I'd agree with you but for the fact that so many of our people are still unvaccinated and chances of new variants developing are high. 

So boosters first for us since studies are showing that it really boosts our protections. Then by all means protect the world because unless everyone is vaccinated, we're not safe. It can spread again as it did the first time."
0,"No sympathy. 

They should all sign a waiver saying they will voluntarily forgo a hospital bed in the event they get sick. Selfish self centered people that then go infect unsuspecting good people."
2,"They seem to be having a hands off plan for misinformation. I don't blame them because it would be risky, constitutionally. 

But Facebook and Twitter are worth hundreds of billions of dollars and are doing nothing about, which is a disgrace."

2,I wonder what would happen if we got the money out of politics.
0,Watch Republicans slam companies for not supporting this for being ‚Äúwoke‚Äù.
2,"While corporate money in politics can be considered bribery, most of it is legal in the US. Many of these companies will fund anyone on committees that oversee their particular market, so just about every congressman, state or federal, gets political donations from big corporations, and if they are committee chairs or get lots of press, they get more, regardless of political affiliation, as long as that corporation feels they can expect preferential treatment access. Every bill is backed by congressmen who take corporate money. I doubt AT&T is donating to ban abortion specifically, they are likely donating to many state and federal-level stooges hoping they will regulate their industry in AT&T's favor. If those stooges also happen to be right-wing jack-asses? AT&T probably doesn't care."

0,"Republicans are still trying to sabotage Biden through a laughable debt ceiling. Please ask anyone of them, if they have any debt ceiling in regards to their personal finances? I didn‚Äôt hear talks of debt ceiling from republicans when Trump drove the economy to the ground with a mega deficit. Another laughable republican economic plan is their so-called ‚Äútrickle down economy‚Äù, a Koch backed theory that the rich shouldn‚Äôt be taxed as it tends to hurt the economy. If republicans truly cared for the economy, they wouldn‚Äôt give tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations.

0,I wonder if one of their motivations in passing these regressive laws is to drive out liberals and moderates from their state in an attempt to combat the possibility of changing demographics turning their states from red to purple and eventually blue.
0,"Perhaps. 

Thing is though, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin all are majority liberal cities. They get around that by the politicians picking the voters, not the voters picking the politicians.  Texas gerrymanders the hell out of districts to keep it red and there has always been complaints of election fraud that never go anywhere.  

The crew that is in charge now are corrupt AF.  Ken Paxton has been indicted for several felonies while he has been AG but he always slithers his way out. Dan Patrick used to be a big coke head and Abbott is just a cronies crony.  They have managed to completely fuck up that state."

1,"Unions, AKA the *Democratic Establishment.*  (Also little old Black ladies.)"
0,"I'm worried too, but for this it's not really that California Republicans are gaining momentum. It's solely because of the idiotic rules for recall elections where someone can replace a slightly unpopular governor with a tiny minority of the vote."
0,"Totally agree.  When I saw the recall effort initially, I just laughed it off as more GQP fuckery.  

I just can't believe there are really that many people in CA that are in support of this.  Really not a good thing going into the midterms."
1,It's not hard. But some Democrats are disgustingly apathetic and I can't understand why. Why we're still playing games is beyond me.
0,"To be fair, it's really only in danger of happening in California due to their absolutely idiotic format for recall elections. Otherwise, Republicans would literally never be able to elect a governor."
2,Not Canada! That was supposed to be my safe haven for when everything in America  went to crap.
0,Yeah. It's too easy to unseat a governor who is only having a slight dip in popularity or if there is a motivated minority voting in a low turnout election. Plus the way that the replacement is selected produces a new governor with nothing near a popular mandate.
0,Isn't PG&E being held liable for for tens of billions of dollars in damages? Blaming that on Newsom seems like misplaced blame.
0,"No. Paffrath is polling at only 10%.

Good luck holding PG&E accountable when a crazy Republican is in power in CA."
0,"Are you referring to the PG&E settlement? I'm no fan of PG&E, but forcing the largest utility in America into a punitive bankruptcy wouldn't have helped anyone. The simple truth is that PG&E took our money for years and left us with shit infrastructure and we should be enraged at that, but we can't get blood from a turnip. 

Don't retcon the reason for the recall election to be all about the PG&E settlement. The recall was started by a racist, anti-vaxx former sheriff of Yolo County, who coincidentally was just diagnosed with COVID. It is fundamentally undemocratic to allow 12% of the electorate to replace a popularly elected governor. It might be legal for now, but that doesn't make it right."
0,This is why republicans are always trying to recall the governor. It's much easier than winning an actual election.
0,It's not democrats that are apathetic.

0,It is misplaced blame.  Trump withheld federal emergency funds and his arsonist supporters lit the federal land national forest on fire in 2018. It's trump's fault.

1,"Yeah, but they *probably* wouldn't have gotten this one off the ground if Newsom was less of an arrogant jackass - e.g., violating his own Covid restrictions and declining to send his lawyers to challenge the deadline extension so as to not ""legitimize it"". So he shares some blame, but still far better than the alternative."
2,The cartels are pretty terrifying. How does New Zealand sound?
2,"I appreciate this sentiment, but people loudly complain about him going to an elite dinner party which was in a semi outdoors area wasn't really breaking his own restrictions.  It was a grey area.  But that isn't import because if it wasn't this it would have been anything else.  Enough people hated the restrictions that they would sign for a recall regardless and just parrot whatever rhetoric they choose."
2,"It‚Äôs all optics.  Democrats and Republicans are in an asymmetrical optics battle.  They constantly trounce us with this because democrats will punish their own for missteps, while republicans won‚Äôt.

There's no other fucking explanation for why they vote directly AGAINST their self-interest, time after time after time, year after year after year. 

Even though they're poor, their loyalty lies with millionaires, billionaires and corporations. Can you imagine being THIS psychologically manipulated?

They constantly complain about minor minimum wage increases causing inflation and higher prices for goods and services, not considering that executive salaries and shareholder profits are the actual problem. 

I'm CONSTANTLY telling people on Facebook that they're not going to pay $20 for a Big Mac if Billy Bob makes $7.45 instead of $7.25 for flipping burgers. Then I ask them if they're interested in seeing the quarterly shareholder report."
1,"Pragmatically, you can't change economic realities through legislative fiat. How easy do you think it is for people to live on 0 dollars an hour in any state?

Idealistically, people have the right to sell their labor for whatever price they want. No voluntary agreement should be arbitrarily criminalized because you personally find it unfair."

""Fear"" and ""Enemy"" are part of the Conservative mindset. As far as wealthy disparity, it started for real with Reagan and he used the flag to create the enemy. From there it's gotten more twisted. 

Ironically, the right and left DO share a common enemy. And if both sets of eyes were on the ball, things would change. Won't happen though. I think it's too deeply ingrained."
0,"This happens regularly in any other advanced economy though? UK, Australia, Norway, New Zealand etc etc. So you can do it. 

It's because Republicans have this fear of anything socialist. A fear created by the to control the few. It's to such a degree, these days ""communist"" ""Marxist"" are shouted at people with no real understanding of what those words actually mean but making sure they can wipe out any economic descent.

 they then go an vote against their own interests under fear of economic collapse cos minimum wage workers got paid an extra few dollars an hour lol. 

I worked out the other day, Jeff Bezos worth today 200bil (well few days ago) could pay all 798 000 Amazon staff himself for the next 8 years until he runs out of money.

2,"In what news have you heard is misinformation?

Also, if one is spreading misinformation, don't you believe is is better to just oust them with facts rather than go out and BAN them. I've seen many times someone banned for ""misinformation"" and ""hatespeech"" and when I read it myself it's a complete lie and unfair. In fact I consider them irrefutable at certain times. If one is so wrong surely it wouldn't be hard, certainly if you acknowledge it as wrong, you know the reasons yourself and can specify them for the public.

Especially with twitter who ban posts on covid they label as having a potentisl risk of spresding misinformation. By doing this they pretty much acknowledge people are incredibly credulous and naive. Otherwise why else would they ban it? Surely the individual could judge for themselves whether it is misinformation or not.

Besides. How do we reslly believe a corporation like twitter has our best interests?(As a citizen of America) They are openly are leftist and actively censor snd silence opposing views. Trunp is banned while we have terrorists like the Taliban alloud on there.

In my opinion they just censor opposing views because they know there is the fear of convincing them they(the poster) are right. In which they don't want that for propably some self centered reason or they want to maintain along with all other sources a monopoly on news with leftist indoctrination(Trans, LGTBTQ+, Feminist movement?, and whatever else. TV radio, sports, cartoons, movies and books.)

I've seen this advocacy EVERYWHERE and a minority of conservstive or rightest views(atleast on social media)"

My interpretation is that it's just that Republicans constantly go on about how ""It was Antifa who stormed the White House, not Trump supporters!"" however whenever someone suggests creating an impartial committee to find and arrest whoever was at the White House that day, they suddenly get extremely defensive.

The Texas 'heartbeat ban' isn't medically accurate because there's no heart that early in pregnancy, providers say

Many women don't know they're pregnant at 6 weeks, when a pregnancy is still an embryo.¬†HUIZENG HU/ Getty Images

""Heartbeat bills"" are misnomers because there's no heart nor beating at 6 weeks of pregnancy.¬†

Doctors can only detect fluttering cells that will become the heart, and call it ""cardiac motion.""¬†

A 6-week pregnancy is an embryo, not a fetus, and fetal heart development is a continuum.¬†

The new¬†Texas law banning abortions after 6 weeks of pregnancy,¬†like others like it, is often referred to as a ""heartbeat bill,"" indicating a cutoff point when doctors can detect a fetal heartbeat.¬†

As Texas Governor Greg Abbot¬†said in a Facebook video¬†right before signing the bill, it ""ensures that the life of every unborn child who has a heartbeat will be saved from the ravages of abortion."" The law is expected to be challenged and, if it prevails, will go into effect September 1, 2021.¬†

But¬†Dr. Bhavik Kumar, a family medicine physician and abortion provider at the Planned Parenthood Center for Choice in Houston, told Insider ""pregnancies this early do not have a beating heart"" ‚Äî and that's a medical fact.¬†

For one, a pregnancy that's six weeks along is still an embryo. It's not a fetus until the 9th week after conception or 11th week after the last menstrual period, according to¬†Healthline.¬†

Plus, most women don't even know they're pregnant at six weeks, let alone get a doctor's appointment to confirm it.¬†

""At six weeks, most women would not have any clue they were even pregnant if they weren't carefully tracking menstrual cycles, and that doesn't even take into account the millions of women with irregular cycles who might go six weeks or longer between periods as a normal part of their life,"" Dr. Stephanie Ros, an OB-GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of South Florida, told Insider.¬†

She said at that point, the embryo is a quarter-inch long. ""It's barely noticeable on ultrasound, we often have to use transvaginal ultrasound to be able to see it at all,"" she said.¬†

What's really happening is 'cardiac motion' from cells that will become the heart

The so-called ""heartbeat"" that's detected at six weeks isn't a heart nor is it beating. ""There's electrical activity within cells that will become a heart, and we see that on an ultrasound machine as a flickering that can be audible through the machine,"" Kumar said. ""We refer to that as cardiac motion.""¬†

""Certainly different people have different feelings around seeing that and what that means,"" Kumar added, ""and that is up to each person to decide how they value that.""¬†

Indeed, the president of the¬†American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which represents more than 60,000 OB-GYNs in the US,¬†made a similar point in 2019¬†in opposition to ""heartbeat bills.""

""Pregnancy and fetal development are a continuum,"" he said. ""What is interpreted as a heartbeat in these bills is actually electrically induced flickering of a portion of the fetal tissue that will become the heart as the embryo develops."" That tissue continues to develop throughout the first trimester.¬†

Only in the past few decades has the technology been advanced enough to detect cardiac motion that early, Dr. Saima Aftab, medical director of the Fetal Care Center at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami,¬†told LiveScience in 2019. The fluttering, she said, also doesn't indicate the viability of the future heart or the pregnancy.¬†"
2,"I get it. I‚Äôm team thanos, I want less people on earth. If we pronounce people dead when their heart stops, then it's not out of this world to start life when the heartbeat starts. And if they did the bill for 9 weeks for the heart to develop, we would still have the same outrage."
1,"Cue the ""we need to deny welfare to unwed mothers who blatantly 'decide' to have a baby"" crowd."
1,"I really want to have a discussion, about this, No politics, no name calling, just a simple discussion, I understand what this article is saying, but I want to know why it does not bring up adoption, just give the child up to an adoption agency or surrender it to the hospital upon delivery this way the hospital can give it to an agency that can give it to a family that really might want it?"
0,"Funny because I, a blue state resident, is keeping red states like Texas afloat by the taxes I pay."
0,"How does that alleviate the burden of carrying a rapist's child?  How does that (to put it bluntly) undestroy their body?  How does that prevent the hospital bill, or the trauma of childbirth?  How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria?  How does that make it less of an economic burden to take an unwanted child and foist them into a poorly organized and definitely underfunded foster system (it's Texas, in case you think they care) that _mostly_ results in molestation, prostitution and abuse?  How does that not further the burden of guilt placed on someone who never wanted that child to begin with?

Utterly and completely destroying a good section of the work force, emotionally, physically, financially and in all ways permanently, (unless they have a neuralizer, panacea or a winning lottery ticket respectively) is not good for the economy.

And that's just considering the unlucky and unwilling mother.  What of her coworkers, or her significant other?  They have to pick up the hours or those companies simply do without, resulting in lost revenue, quality, and supply.  Have you ever worked a 12 hour double shift, or an 8 hour triple shift?  Because I fucking have, and I wasn't even involved.  Now you have to deal with burn out and turn over from an entirely unrelated set of people, time into training and damaged product or shoddy services resulting in slow-down FOR 9 MONTHS.  And that's if they can come back at all!  The U.S. at large basically doesn't even have a support system for pregnant people if you compare it to other first world nations.

There is no ""what if we try x."". This is a bad law designed to make broken homes that a political base can scapegoat and slavewage 16 years down the line.  It is designed to be economically expensive because that's _the whole point._"
2,"Do you know how much an abortion at planned parent hood or some other abortion clinic is? Honest question I do not know. I found planned parent hood says it could be $0-$1,500. but I am not sure what other places charge, I know in a hospital it can be 5,000 or a bit more for vaginal birth or higher for C-section. How can any women really afford a abortion then or delivery period then? 

You talk about How does that (to put it bluntly) undestroy their body? or the trauma of childbirth? How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria.  Have you seen the side effects of both a hormonal pill abortion or a medical abortion? For hormonal pill, it is not unusual for a women having to go to the hospital because the bleeding does not stop, but continues to get worse. Some women become sick and mentally damaged seeing that amount of blood and the cells of the baby after cleaning up that mess, During the surgical abortion where they stick a vacuum up there, it is not unusual for the doctor to cause damage to the uterus and other organs that actuary harm the chance of having another baby in the future, along with bleeding, and causing tears that might need to be surgically fixed. So you will have to go to the hospital for surgery. which case is all traumatic in my opinion. and more of an economic burden now they have more bills to pay. (not saying vaginal birth or C-section is better they all have their risk too)

to your other argument, why cant an employer higher a temp from an agency? There are temp agency that people do sign up with to find part time work, they usually work part time or full time during a short period of work, do you think those short term workers would like to have that job for a bit?"

2,"Brazilians are clowns...I know it  ran away from the country as soon as I could. The truth however is more complex and it is not fully portrayed around the world. There are things, a few of them where Bolsonaro is right and on point, others show how ill-suited he is. With that being said, the options were even worse in the last elections.
The Supreme Court in brazil is the biggest joke there ever was, it needs to be completely reformed (The US supreme court should also be reformed, by the way)
The brazilians have a supreme court where ANY lawyer, appointed by a POLITICIAN can become a member, no need to be a judge, no need to be someone suited for the job, and that is a lifetime position! ANY supreme court that is unbiased and trustworthy need to be populated by FEDERAL JUDGES, appointe by election amongst all federal judges in the country, and I said JUDGES, not mere, ill-prepared lawyers. The political appointment process needs to be eliminated, and until it is so, no one will trust the courts. (that holds true in Brazil, US or any democracy).
Also, the voting issue, Bolsonaro is for electronic PLUS paper ballot, so it could be audited, similarly to the US...imagine an election where the electronic votes could not be audited? Yes, that is Brazil. But guess, the brazilian (comunists-inclined) opposition is against that. There is no transparency throughout society, and a society that has its powers opaque to its population, is a democracy of the rich and powerful, (like Russia, Belarus, China....and the list goes on) and all of these countries, including Brazil and US are heading that way unless structural changes are made....and those are usually painful. Inhave little hope though."
0,"You are saying shit. Bolsonaro supporters want a coup to keep Bolsonaro in the power as a dictator, it is what they truly dream of. 

Bolsonaro fighting corruption? Haha You must idolatrate  him to say this nonsense. 
Even the Lava-jato operation that has put Lula in jail he fought against. Now, we  know that his whole family is involved  crimes of stealing money of their employees in the government. He also protected the guy that as asking bribes when buying vaccine."
0,"I agree, there are a lot of reasons why Bolsonaro got there in the first place. I even voted for Bolsonaro in 2018, but because I was disillusioned with the polarized reality of that time and thought he represented a drastic change and action, but as it turns out he was another right-wing populist nutjob, and I slowly began realizing it just like many americans did with Trump. You rightfully point out the Supreme Court is politically appointed, but guess who appointed a judge who freed Lula from jail? You rightfully point out corruption is rampant, but guess who is the one who destroyed the Car-Wash Operation? Yes, Bolsonaro, because turns out, he is a corrupt crook along with his entire family. In the beginning, I used to believe that ""Bolsonaro is a fascist who wants to be dictator"" was just leftist conspiracy, but the more he began actually voicing against democratic institutions, the more I realized all these speeches about ""cleaning the swamp"", or about ""saving the nation"", or about ""the corrupts within congress"" have always been far-right dogwhistles and I had fallen this conspiracy rabbithole, which I have slowly been escaping ever since the pandemic began.

So no, there's no such a thing as ""communist-inclined"" opposition against Bolsonaro, because a lot of prominent right-wing political movements such as the MBL broke off with Bolsonaro, so his opposition is pretty broad even though there are indeed left-wing people in the opposition, just like every opposition against a far-right government. No, there is no such a thing as ""Bolsonaro is for electronic plus paper ballot"", because even if he was for that, the true intention of his when voicing for this agenda is to make people distrust the system and de-stabilize democracy so he can come out as ""the man who will solve it all"", and this entire agenda of electronic plus paper ballot is another dogwhistle for ""the democratic system is bad and I want to be dictator"". Yes, there is no transparency throught society and yes Brazil is a banana republic, but the ""twist"" is that Bolsonaro himself is part of the infamous ""Centr√£o"" of brazilian politics, you know, the ""banana politicians"" themselves, of the rich and powerful?

To summarize: the only thing Bolsonaro ever did for Brazil is to pave the path for the gangsters of Lula to come back and continue their legacy of corruption in the name of the poor, he destroyed the legacy of the sane right-wing who only wanted to fight the corruption of Lula and the PT, and most importantly: the deaths of thousands who fell into his far-right rethoric that the ""virus doesn't exist"", or ""if it exists, China made it up"", just like what happened to many americans with Trump. So fuck Bolsonaro, fuck his far-right nutjobs and fuck his terroristic ""milicias""."

It's natural to be disappointed when we can't get everything we want, but let's keep things in perspective. With a 50-50 tie in the Senate and a mere 8 vote majority in the House, the Democrats are walking an ultrathin tight rope. Even then, they've been getting things down at a historically breakneck space.

You often see the party controlling the White House lose seats during a midterm such as 2018 when the dems took the house."
2,"The US representatives are elected every 2 years. there will be an election in (middle of the presidents term). Depending, you may also be voting for state or local offices, referenda, etc. Google (2022 ballot) at ballotpedia  next summer and it will show you a sample ballot once you give it your zip code or something. IN THE MEANTIME you can write your current reps. do fundraising, get educated about the issues, a lot of things. Voting is not the end of your civic duty, it is the beginning."
2,It‚Äôs an election for of the Senate‚Äôs seats and the entirety of the House of Representatives. I also believe a bunch of Governor positions are up for grabs this year as well.
2,"Hard disagree. Republicans are dying in droves from covid. Abortion is a hot button issue for a lot of people but most take that to mean it'll make Republicans come out to vote, but it also does the opposite too. Being a hot button topic, it makes pro choice people mobilized to vote as well. I won't lie and say it'll be a super easy sweep, but I'm nowhere near dooming about it as hard as I was before."
2,That‚Äôs some remarkable prognosticating for an election that‚Äôs about 14 months out!

0,Even if you think that's true it's still a better option than the Republicans
0,"I think the problem with the idea of a strong opposition being good for democracy, is that it assumes the opposition is acting in good faith and cares about the well-being of its citizens. Since conservatives obviously don‚Äôt qualify, they are just reactionaries."
0,The media is being ridiculous about Afghanistan. It wasn't pretty but it feels like biden should be impeached for this if i only watched the media. Also how tf is it biden's fault we have such disappointing vaccine numbers and for case rise. It's literally Republicans fault.
1,"Afghanistan is ridiculous, but Biden and Congress absolutely could be doing better, even if they wont. Contact tracing and paying people to stay home would make a huge difference. Instead schools are open."
2,You know why Clinton wasn't removed? Dems held the senate... if Republicans have a majority in both chambers they will convict.

Don't let the perfect become the enemy of the good. 

And it perfectly encapsulates my feelings on this. Please hold strong, defeating right wing extremism next year is our only path to bolder action in the future. Otherwise the action republicans take in power will set us back decades"
0,"I disagree to a point.  M4a and UBI were serious topics of conversation,  including other ""socialist"" programs + climate.  I lived through the Reagan eras, the country has moved forward,  including LGBTQ  rights. Is it as fast as I'd like? Absolutely not - and why I'm involved in helping local candidates run for office.  Politics is slow AF, and the dems have a very large and diverse tent for ideas. Theres the old adage,  ""dems fall in love, Republicans fall in line"" which holds true and why we don't see th Qcult kicked to the curb (or tea party).

Yeah, it took trump to turn out the dem vote. Issue is, the ones who can and need to move the country forward at a quick step,  are millennials,  who just aren't old enough to be reliable voting bloc. 

The major focus really needs to be on un-fuhking the gerrymandered states and allow for more easy access.  This would truly ensure progress and provide a cushion /relax fear of pushing legislation forward that needs to be done,  and not worry about midterm backlash as the Republicans would be nearly dead in the water."
2,"Even if you don't get super bold actions you get something, while the other guys basically do nothing or make your life worse. But whatever, you go cry about your simple way of seeing it while your country burns. This shit is serious right now I don't even get why you can't see that."
2,Mostly because MAGA isn't going away.
2,"I'm not super optimistic about the house but I'm hoping regardless of the results we hold the senate (and possibly end up with a split or better)

All it does is disillusion voters, which is only counterproductive."
2,Yang was the only person for UBI and Bernie was the only one for M4A and even he has walked back on it. What serious convos did you see that I missed?
1,If it‚Äôs so serious then the Dems should be able to easily give us some of what we‚Äôre asking for. You‚Äôre asking voters to put forward effort but not doing the same to the politicians you want us to vote for. Do you honestly think that‚Äôs persuasive?
2,"The country has already been burning, it's just not in parts that affect you."
0,You‚Äôre right! Biden has been an excellent president so far
0,Yes 66 senators..this is also why Trump wasn't convicted.. I understand... if we don't all vote that will happen. That's what I'm saying.
2,"Insisting on bipartisanship and going after the moderate republican vote instead of putting forward legislation that may be controversial, but is vehemently supported, ie, Medicare for All, aspects of the Green New Deal, cannabis reform, raising the min wage. But they largely remain silent on those bc their corporate donors don‚Äôt want it, and they‚Äôd have to actually do work to convince people on the fence. It‚Äôs easier and safer for them to do nothing."
0,"That's pretty much what I said... isn't it?

I didn't disparage dems, I just said they aren't stepping up to the plate as needed, but Republicans are certainly toxic and guaranteed destruction of our democracy."
2,"Being that you're first sentence was a fact less, baseless assumption,  you no longer have any credibility with me... you are why progressives lose... you don't think you just rage... starting off a response with a stupid assumption that also has the narcissistic side dish of touting how amazing you are is not only off putting but embarrassing for you... 

If you want to have a real discussion try again... you get one more chance."
2,"Well, many of them discussed m4a, with side options (Warren, yang, Sanders). 

UBI was on the main stage for the first time, discussed and made its way into the public arena, including cities instituting it. 

"
0,It's a little bit more complicated than you're presenting it. We're on the razor edge of holding power and barely holding together a coalition with moderate democrats. As a progressive myself sometimes it feels like this non yielding outlook is naive. In order to get what you're demanding requires us to make gains in the house and Senate. Throwing away your vote in protest almost guarantees you'll never get what you want.
2,I'm not trying to persuade you. You are as dense as the fascists.  I'm probably going to just leave.
0,"If you want all that, stop talking shit on Democrats and make sure they get elected.  I've lived in Virginia for 20 years, and for the first time last year Democrats achieved a statewide trifecta:  the governor's mansion and both houses of the legislature.  Since that time, Virginia has legalized cannabis, raised the minimum wage, secured voting rights, expanded public healthcare, passed environmental protections, and a host of other things you no doubt value.

You know how they did it?  By having a solid majority where Democrat legislators from more conservative areas could defect on certain issues.  Republicans did NOTHING to help any of this happen, but Democrats still had the numbers because their majority is solid.

""Both sides are the same"" is the stupidest, most counterproductive thing people are saying right now, and it needs to stop.  It's not based on fact.  It's something half-informed people say to make themselves sound skeptical and savvy, but in the end it only destroys any chance of making progress."
0,"I think you responded to the wrong person.  I'm not a progressive.  I'm a left-leaning moderate.  I used to be an occasional swing voter too.

And I don't actually believe you're any sort of Democrat at all.  Just a Republican in disguise trying to sow division in the party.  Make claims to the contrary all you want; it's your actions that show it."
2,Weren‚Äôt they discussing ways of NOT doing it? And only one of those is a Democrat anyway. Yang and Sanders are independents aren‚Äôt they?
2,"Vote for the people who start the fire or the people who don‚Äôt put out the fire, either way you burn."
2,">ways of not doing it

They were talking about side options for companies and squabbling over nuance but it was a solid push for m4a with a few different flavors. 

>independents

I don't think so, they are democrats but at the edges of the current tent and appeal to progressives and *some* independents (and fringe ""libertarians."" Whom are often ignorant of what libertarianism is and want to be contrarian, or - and I contend, a large portion are made up of bots bad faith internet actors. Look at the Bernie subs and bizarre overlap with thedonald + redpill+ language).

Edit: this isn't to say Bernie voters are not real, I know plenty who were,  they just didn't act like or talk like what you see in those subs or online.  Most of the Bernie bros hate major portions of the internet (millennials) for security concerns.  At least, the ones I know irl."
2,I wonder how this all works out with her security detail. They probably have to sweep the place every morning.
0,"The Republican'ts are so desperate to turn this into a ""beige suit"" moment that they don't realize it's 2021 and it's going to backfire on them gloriously. Progress is coming, and progressives will need to VOTE! Slogans are useless. JUST VOTE!"

0,Texas is turning into Gilead
0,"Texas won't secede because... Honestly I'm too exhausted to explain why the state can't at this point. It just can't. As for most rational Texans, we're American, or at least we try and uphold the things that originally made this country and state great, however those assholes ""in charge"" are very un-American, they spit in the face of those that know what it means to be Texan. Thankfully we have some elections coming up soon. 

As for stepping foot in the state, don't. You're not missing out on anything (honestly what the hell would someone even come here for?). Save your money and buy yourself something nice with it. Deny this state your sales tax. You want to hurt a man, hurt him in the wallet."
2,"I'm going to have an unpopular opinion here, but it is not all of Texas. It is the oppressive political system they are in and if they secede, the women affected by the barbaric laws they are making will have even fewer rights. 

I understand the frustration with a portion of that state, but the what the Democrats in that state have been doing shows the desperation of a large section of the population. The productive action would be to call for justice and national influence to be put on those passing these laws. Please do not forget that the state is not a monolith and you condemn all of them with statements like this.

Edit: I guess I didn't know how to spell secede."
2,"We need to invade. Topple the state government, arrest the leaders, all that good stuff."

2,You know what? You're exactly right!! I apologize to the good people in Texas who are trapped in this situation. It wasn't fair to me to paint everyone there with the same brush. Thank you for pointing that out. I let me temper get the best of me
2,How about Texas democrats start selling it better and fucking up the GOP instead.....when dipshits in Texas like Beto O'Rourke go on record saying he will vote to ban the guns most Texans have as a prime example...Texas Democrats look like they're just as fucki g stupid as the rest of the damn state.  Until Texas Dems get smart & sell it better to their rural constituents you're gonna get fucked up the ass every time.
2,"They're doing it themselves, notice how there's been no legislation at all concerning the failing energy grid and winter is coming. Those people are obsessed with cultural issues that don't effect their daily lives at all, unlike their failing energy grid. Darwinism in action"
0,"One of the major disadvantages of modern technology is the fact that idiots like the ones in Texas aren't weeded out at a young age. Technology has prevented natural selection, which would normally be a good thing, but not in this case."
0,"True, the lack of Covid precautions is weeding them out though, lol"
0,"It's ironic how republikkkans will give billions of dollars to rich, big businesses ""to help the economy"", but giving the average person money to buy goods that would actually stimulate the economy is a non-starter.

Keep people down is the only way they stay in power.

Instead of paying people's electric bills. Why not pay to have solar panels put on their house. But that takes money out of the pockets of the people giving ""OUR"" representatives money.

Hmmm....."
0,I am starting to think that they want the working classes to stay poor and desperate  so that they'll be easier to exploit.... am I wrong for this?
1,"Spot on, their language is also says the same.

0,"By enforcing the FACE Act, protecting women that go into clinics with federal agents."
2,What was your expectation arrest Trump ? that‚Äôs not how law works
2,Women is protected by Texas law it‚Äôs providers who were in trouble
0,"Garland is only one among a line of lawmen that turn out to be wet farts; such as Patrick Fitzgerald, Comey, Mueller, Cy Vance‚Ä¶ 

It easier to just accept that they aren‚Äôt here to help us but to maintain the integrity of the system."
2,"Yes, but the FACE Act, in its wording, protects both women and facilities."
0,"The thing is, if ""pro-life"" conservatives truly wanted fewer abortions, they would 100% support better sex education in schools and easier (or free) access to contraceptives, because those are the only two reliable methods of reducing the number of abortions. 

They go on and on about ""saving the life of the child"", but what about the quality of life for that child? Are Texas voters going to improve their foster care system? Will they support giving financial aid to mothers who can't afford the children that they never wanted? I don't hear any mention from them about what they are willing to do to support these unwanted children. 

Why are they silent about helping these unwanted children? Because they don't really care about the children. They only care about punishing women for being sexually active. They want women to suffer because those women aren't conforming to their conservative ideals."
0,"Pro-Life Religious Conservatives also love advocating for people who are on life support but will otherwise not get better. People who cannot advocate for themselves e.g. the braindead or the unborn are a great campaigning point for the conservative right because it requires no resources and allows them to both scare people and make people angry at the perceived moral backwardness of progressives. See this podcast about Terry Schiavo for a great example

"
0,Yeah no wonder rightoids chose the heart over the brain when deciding what‚Äôs alive
2,So what restrictions are we placing on men then?
0,"In all fairness, while a fetus doesn‚Äôt yet a conscious, they are still likely to be born (unless there‚Äôs a as opposed to a brain dead person

Regardless, before the fetus is viable, it has no brain function and is on the same level as a brain dead person. The heartbeat argument isn‚Äôt a good one."
0,"Republicans once tried to steal a brain-dead woman from her family to keep her alive as a way of responding to exactly this argument.    
"
2,Is it illegal in Texas to put the fetus on life support and then pull the plug?
0,"Well, I think some Republicans are smart enough to realize that if they outlaw pulling life support on people who are brain dead, hospitals would be overwhelmed with care for individuals who had no chance of walking out the door again.

But Republicans have no problem telling women they need to be life support for a fetus, whether the woman chooses to or not."
0,The same people yammering on about abortion being murder believe that pulling the plug on a brain dead person is also murder. Remember Terry Schivo?
2,These monsters oppose that too. No matter how much their grandma is suffering they will refuse to end her misery.
0,"There is no logic when dealing with people willing to do mental gymnastics to fit their square beliefs into the round holes of reality. Let‚Äôs not get into the argument of let‚Äôs force motherhood on girls but not force fatherhood on boys. Or here‚Äôs a good one that‚Äôll put them in a logic loop, if an illegal immigrant is pregnant does that mean her child is a us citizen?"
2,"This is a messy analogy. Obviously a fetus at six weeks is ‚Äúalive‚Äù both sides know this. A brain dead person is at the end of their conscious and a fetus is at the beginning. That‚Äôs the real difference.

I don‚Äôt think republicans chose the heartbeat detection because that means human life. They think it‚Äôs human life from the start. They just know they have to keep it legal in SOME capacity, no matter how minor. The heart best is a symbolic choice for them. And it just so happens to be before most women even know that they are pregnant."
2,"Thinking back to Terri Shiavo, I'm pretty sure conservatives were arguing not to unplug her."
0,i‚Äôm all for abortion but how is someone about to die and someone ab to be born comparable
1,Interesting argument but the difference is that braindead people will never be cognitive again whereas fetuses are still growing into cognitive people
2,Let‚Äôs go with just not killing people at all. That would be nice.
0,"Throw in emergency contraception as well(Plan B, or the ‚Äúmorning after‚Äù pill). Because people make mistakes."
0,"I was born to an ill-treated mother who hated girls, couldn't succeed in her efforts to in induce a miscarriage, and couldn't cope with having a 5th child at 25.  In my 60s I still suffer from the mental and physical injuries. I wouldn't wish my childhood onto anyone. 

Women must be free to choose, not just for their own sakes, but for the sake of their children."
0,"This is of course correct. They don‚Äôt want abortions to go down, they want women to stop having sex (except with them of course). It isn‚Äôt about abortion, it‚Äôs about sex and who they think should and shouldn‚Äôt be having it."
0,"Its 100% about judgment and control. If you allow free access to contraceptives and sex ed, you are condoning sinners. To them, its a sin trade- sex or abortion."
0,I‚Äôve long held that any pro lifer that has their own kids instead of adopting is a hypocrite.
2,They should be pulling the plug on a lot of the COVID patients in ICUs. What a delusional waste.
1,I mean an abortion is just pulling the plug as well. The plug in this case is a womb.
0,"Everything that the religious right supports makes sense in the context of punishing women for sex and does not make sense in the context of preventing abortions: abstinence only education, prohibitions on birth control and lack of government support for families. At some point in time we have to stop giving abusers the benefit of their word."
1,Yes but the definition of ‚Äúlife‚Äù and ‚Äúalive‚Äù can be debated based on what you believe. According to science everything is alive in some way as long as the cells are alive
0,That was one very public case. Brain dead people get taken off life support every day and not a peep from the right. They also have no issue with taking a human life if they feel the human doesn‚Äôt deserve to live(executions).
0,"There is no difference. 

Either you support life, or you don‚Äôt. 

The republicans do not. 

You cannot claim to be pro life and be in favor of the death penalty.

You cannot claim to be pro life and be in favor of someone who refuses to wear a mask, knowing doing so may kill a child."
0,That‚Äôs horrific and sad. So many tragic stories that get conveniently ignored by people who call themselves religious. I am so GD tired of these people ruining the entire world for everyone else. So tired and so angry that I hope they do not get vaccines and get to meet their sky daddy sooner than later. The preverbal silver lining.
0,"Woah, that seems to be quite a severe reaction to a joke about the unconstitutional stupidity going on in Texas. Guess you aren‚Äôt competent enough to have a baby or raising children either. Womp womp."
2,The type of people who shouldn‚Äôt be raising children include people who hide behind a screen and throw needless insults at strangers. I‚Äôm sure whatever little spawn comes from you will also be an asshole.
2,I agree that some of these people just don‚Äôt want what they perceive as an easy out for irresponsable sexual behaviors. Yes But a lot of these people very genuinely believe it‚Äôs wrong to end a human life in the womb. And not everyone who believes that is religious or even conservative.
0,"Irrelevant, neither have the right to use someone else's body or resources to continue existing. 

If a person needed one of your lungs to live, should you be forced to give it to them?"
0,BUT THE NEWS SAID ‚ÄúIT WAS THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT!‚Äù AND MY FRIENDS SAID ‚ÄúTHEY WANT TO PUNISH WOMEN.‚Äù WHY ARENT YOU AGREEING WITH ME!?
0,"Why should it matter? It is an embryo not a baby. It is a woman's choice, nit the court's or government's while still not viable outside her body. Forcing a woman to carry is inhumane. Back to illegal, unsafe abortions?"
0,"""Noone has the right to use someone else's body or resources to continue existing""
The point is true in all aspects but it still extends way after a person is born, Infact, baby, children and even many teenagers may not be equipped to survive. In so the argument you provide also excuses a parent putting their infant baby on the street and leave."
2,"No. I mean, I think that‚Äôs a weak analogy. But yes, I agree abortion should be legal.

Abortion is killing a human. But sometimes it‚Äôs legal to kill humans. War. Abortion, endings brain dead people."
2,The media is full of shit on both sides. I believe abortion should be legal. I also think it is infanticide. And Im a Democrat. All these things can be true at once.
2,That is actually perfectly legal in many states - ERs and FDs are designated safe surrender sites for women who cannot cope with motherhood

They could even have talked to the Taliban online.  I think I remember that stuff being up, though I didn't look it up.  I don't want to be dumb."

1,"lol, that is rather stupid‚Ä¶not mentioning that actual Democratic leaders gave Taliban so much equipment, that most countries would have problem competing with it haha"
2,So similar. Both obviously shooting to kill. Get these hooligans out of the streets.
2,They aren‚Äôt the same and you know it. If you keep comparing them to stuff like that they‚Äôll just radicalize even more on their stance and hate y‚Äôall more. Maybe just maybe try to not degrade the other side? And try to sympathize? Yall the party of peace and tolerance but it seems to me that the other side never blatantly insults y‚Äôall.

Because, honestly, I don't think that's just a Western thing.

It is quite an irony that the truest defenders of Western Civ are our ~~nefariously leftist~~ liberal-arts universities thought, by the right, to be such hotbeds of leftist indoctrination."

1,I'm proud to be American too. What's dangerous about them exactly?
2,"Right so if you‚Äôre bad at covering something up, that makes it okay? What are you saying? And why won‚Äôt you just call the Taliban terrorists like they are? That‚Äôs not really a controversial label. And also, how can you say Trump was ‚Äúsiding‚Äù with the Taliban by making deals, but then when Biden misjudges the Taliban‚Äôs invasion, and is forced to make deals with those terrorists directly BECAUSE OF HIS OWN MISTAKE, the Taliban is just ‚Äúthe ones that have to be dealt with‚Äù. Yes, they are now, but please think about WHY and how that could have been avoided.

Trump was an absolute idiot and a creep, but it‚Äôs ok to criticize Biden when he messes up too."

2,Why do you call them leftist?
2,Mostly the violence
0,"Quite right. I thought the tone was visible, but it wasn't, so I edited my post. Our universities have a wide range of political stances, but the accepted trope on the right is that all the professors are either Marxist Svengalis or virtuous right-wing conservatives hounded out of academe. Of course, it's idiotic. Just ask Hawley or Cotton, those Harvard prettyboys."
2,"Um, not really. It's not like it's a Western Civ book club that has one guy who broke a window and now the WHOLE CLUB is unfairly branded as window-breakers. The point of the organization is to incite street fights and parade around in uniform. Often with police, invited or not. In this, they are little different than the English blackshirts.

That they make noises about Western Culture doesn't impress me any more than do the noises jihadists make about religion."
2,"I was asked a question (that has been deleted) about ""what civ"" I'm ""proud"" of. Interesting question!

I was raised steeped in Western culture. Grandparents in the German film industry, photographer dad, actress mom. They taught me (some) German and French. Went to international school. Studied physics and medieval studies in a college with a Great Books program. 

I can't think of a better way to spend an afternoon than at the Met or MOMA. 

Am I ""proud"" of Beethoven and Mozart? I had nothing to do with them. I enjoy them, I love them, I am deeply moved by them. But pride implies personal achievement. Just look it up: 

1. feeling deep pleasure or satisfaction as a result of one's own achievements, qualities, or possessions or those of someone with whom one is closely associated.
""a proud grandma of three boys""
2. having or showing a high or excessively high opinion of oneself or one's importance.
""a proud, arrogant man""

I am quite proud of a short play I wrote that got a good review in the NY Times. It brought me to LA where I met my wife who was a TV writer. (Our little joke is that we met through the NY Times.)

I am proud of my father's work, with which I had little to do, but I helped him in the darkroom and changed his film sometimes. 

I work in the space program and I'm proud of that, though I'm in a support position and have nothing to do with designing or selecting missions.

But to be ""proud"" of Monet or Voltaire just seems bizarre to me. I love them and would defend them, and I'm deeply moved by them, and would be devastated if the works were destroyed. But pride doesn't enter into it."
0,But Manchin and Sinema believe the filibuster (a senate rule) is somehow more democratic than the enumerated rights such as the 14th and 15th amendments of the constitution.
2,They should eliminate the filibuster to protect VOTING rights.

Amy Klobuchar: Senate should eliminate the filibuster to protect ~~abortion~~ rights"

Smith, Klobuchar, Omar. Three fucking amazing women. Glad they represent me."
0,"Protect voting rights first.  Then follow up and protect health care and then abortion rights. 

Just my opinion"
2,"So what happens if we lose seats in the midterms. Filibusters are there to protect the minority party. What we do now can be used against us, just like the so called nuclear option was."
2,"The problem is that Senators no longer stand and filibuster.  They send an email and go home. 

We need to return to the stand and talk filibuster.  When you sit, you quit. Then we vote."
0,And voting rights. And the climate.
0,Even worse there are at least two ‚Äúdemocrats‚Äù (Manchin being one) who aren‚Äôt pro choice ‚Ä¶
2,"It‚Äôs not just Manchin and Sinema. 

Joe Biden also wants to keep the filibuster."
2,Agreed! A senate rule shouldn‚Äôt outweigh rights given under the constitution.
0,"That‚Äôs what concerns me too. If we eliminate the filibuster and the GOP grabs the majority? Texas‚Äôs law will look like child‚Äôs play compared to what could be done at the Federal Level.

Personally? I think that we should go back to the old filibuster rules(talking nonstop until the speaker wears out)."
0,"The last time republicans took over the senate, McConnell eliminated the filibuster. That‚Äôs how they confirmed all those federal judges and SCOTUS conservative judges. So yeah, Manchin and Sinema are pretty naive to believe if republicans win the senate, the filibuster will still be around."
1,"Lol, yeah. The GOP has really shown a pattern of following the rules in the past. 

This shit right here is why the Dems, who represent like 60% of the country's population, can't get anything done. When the GOP get power, they fucking use it. When the Dems gets power, they waste 18 months trying to be polite and bipartisan, then get fucking crushed in the midterms.

Voting rights, reproductive rights, climate efforts, income inequality reduction, and every other democratic effort is going to fail in the name of tradition and decorum."
0,It‚Äôs fun how you think McConnell isn‚Äôt going to eliminate the filibuster at the first available opportunity the moment they take control in 2022.
0,"And please understand abortion is nowhere to be found in the Bible nor the constitution. BTW, anyone who believes in pro-life should back vaccines and mask mandates aimed at saving lives."
2,"Biden‚Äôs era of good governance is way behind us. His years in the senate are very different from what we‚Äôre seeing today. During Trump tenure, we‚Äôve seen a complete erosion of moderates and bipartisanship in congress. The guy is like a high school kid asking for his BFF to fight on his side. Biden can‚Äôt get his agenda passed, unless either Manchin and Sinema stop annoying us with their ‚Äúfilibuster is democracy‚Äù non sense, or republicans won‚Äôt use it to sabotage the democratic agenda."
0,"That‚Äôs what concerns you? 

What concerns me is McConnell absolutely eliminating the filibuster just to punish Dems for talking about doing so, and everyone being all ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt do that‚Äù as he proceeds to do it, followed by ‚Äúwell nothing we can do I guess.‚Äù"
0,"If you don't get rid of the filibuster then the GOP wins the midterm elections.

Then they get rid of the filibuster.

Then they take away your right to vote"
2,"That was the so called nuclear option, and was voted in by democrats during the previous administration. Lets not make the same mistake again."
0,"Go for it then, and end the filibuster, and then come on here crying because the GOP got a majority and used your rule against you. They didn't write the nuclear option, we did, now you crying cause they used it. They didn't break any rule, they used the rule we wrote."
1,"It's fun how he used a Democrat rule to do it last time, and people like you can't understand how every new rule you put in place can and will be used against you. It feels good for the moment though, right. How's watching everything you accomplish with that rule get torn down in 2022 gonna feel."
2,"It. Is. Not. Just. Manchin. And. Sinema. 

I‚Äôd be willing to wager there are around 8-10 Democrats who would vote to protect the filibuster if it came down to it on the floor."
2,"My biggest fear about Biden, once I realized he was the only one who could win against trump, was that he knew how serious this moment was, but wouldn‚Äôt step up to it. 

My fears are being proven true every single day."
2,"They could‚Äôve gotten rid of the filibuster when they had slight control‚Ä¶but didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶.why?

Because they knew that getting rid of it would mean that every time the power structure changed, previous legislation could be undone with a simple majority."
2,"Sure, but you don‚Äôt use the nuclear option when convenient, for the simple fact, it overrules the filibuster."
1,"
Why were the democrats forced to go nuclear? You know why. Cut the ‚Äúit‚Äôs the democrats fault for going nuclear‚Äù crap. 

Would you rather they just shrug their shoulders and do nothing? 

‚ÄòCome on."
2,Well... they actually are the ones who ended filibusters for supreme court justices.
2,"I won't be complaining, but to be fair I've completely given up on this shit hole country. We've got like 2 actually liberal senators, 52 conservatives, and 46 who are very concerned on Twitter. I'm just hopeful I can emigrate before it gets much worse."
2,"Imagine thinking the filibuster is gonna save us after Republicans take control in 2022. 

Wow. 

You clearly haven‚Äôt been paying an ounce of attention, have you?"
0,"Quote it. And please, I don‚Äôt want to hear ‚Äúthou shall not kill‚Äù that‚Äôs not abortion."
0,"Again, Biden grew up in a very different era of good government and don‚Äôt expect him to change. McCain was from his era and so ‚Äúwere‚Äù Lindsay, Collins and Murkowski. But since Trump came in, it hasn‚Äôt been the same on the republican side of the aisle. Not that Biden isn‚Äôt doing anything wrong at all. In fact, he‚Äôs on the right side of history. We‚Äôre simply faced with a different era of bad government led by conspiracy theorists in congress and state governments with ZERO knowledge of American government and history per se."
2,"You have no idea why they did what they did.  

I was a lifelong Republican, until 2017.  The GOP of today does not resemble the GOP of 2015."
0,"So you mad about the Republicans using a procedural rule that Democrats came up with to do something you didn't like. And using that as justification to make an even more easily abused rule because it benefits you at the moment, with no concern for the Republican abuses that are almost guaranteed.  Talk about short sighted."
0,"Huh, I‚Äôm saying that the only thing the Bible says about abortion is a recipe for, quite literally, performing an abortion, commanded by God, in the tabernacle nonetheless. I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúthou shalt not kill‚Äù has to do with it. 

"
0,"We‚Äôre going to have to agree to disagree. 

Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm 38, and my entire adult voting life has been watching bad government and watching the Republicans win, even when Democrats have power. 

Trump isn‚Äôt the beginning of something, he‚Äôs the culmination of decades of bad government on Republican terms. He‚Äôs the inevitable endgame of the Republican Party. 

If we can‚Äôt expect Biden to change, then we deserve to lose in 2022 and he deserves to be impeached by the Republicans in 2023. 

Historians in free countries‚Äî which won‚Äôt be ours‚Äî will look back and consider this all to be a progression, not a sudden shift from good government to bad government with the election of Trump.

The election of Trump was the natural reaction to America daring to elect a black man, and you‚Äôd better believe Republicans will burn the country to the ground before they ever see Kamala Harris in the Oval Office. 

We our on borrowed time, a narrow window, and Biden is counting on institutions to save us when they have already failed."
0,"You‚Äôre looking at the whole thing from your own simplistic point of view. You do know republicans became the party of ‚ÄúNO‚Äù under Obama right? They wouldn‚Äôt allow democrats to pass any bills at all. Please don‚Äôt make this about me. Unless you understand that republicans spend their entire terms in congress sabotaging democrats, this conversation is futile. Many republicans came by and went, but Gingrich, Boehner, McConnell and McCarthy have been the worst in modern history. Democrats legislate, republicans on the other hand, spend their entire time resisting democratic legislations without offering any alternatives. Pro-life and white supremacy aren‚Äôt what make the nation move forward. When was the last time republicans introduced any bills for the general welfare? Tax cuts for the wealthy?"
1,"I‚Äôm 100% sure the person living in the fantasy world is you, who for some reason thinks the filibuster is part of the Constitution and will save Dem progress. 

Bless your angry heart."
1,"Anyways, let‚Äôs come back to this conversation in about two and a half years when McConnell ends the filibuster and you act surprised about it. 

It‚Äôll be right around the time they‚Äôre impeaching Biden, just because they can.

Can‚Äôt wait to say I told you so. 

But, sure. The filibuster, man. Totally the savior of American democracy."
0,"Yeah, Moses‚Äô Book of Numbers. I thought you were against abortion and my only point was that republicans keep throwing their anti-abortion stances out there and it‚Äôs apparently based on Christianity, yet they‚Äôre unable to prove which scriptures in the Bible ban it."
0,"This passage from Numbers is always mentioned and always dismissed. Most pro-life people will interpret this as a recipe for causing sterility, not abortion. Either way, pretty disturbing."
0,"In modern history and right after Gingrich, the only time republicans were this extreme was when Obama came in. No one is saying there was never any disagreements between democrats and republicans, it‚Äôs expected and as a matter of fact, it‚Äôs part of the democratic process in which the system of checks and balances is based on and compromise being the ultimate outcome. And yes, Trump did finalize the radicalism of the Republican Party that went directly after the very institutions of the federal government. That‚Äôs not disagreements, it‚Äôs anarchy, sedition and treason. I‚Äôm fully aware of the racist, anti-semitic, homophobic, Islamophobic and sexist agenda of the Republican Party to attend to its confederate base, but it didn‚Äôt amount to an insurrection on the Capitol until Trump came in."
1,"Yea, like 4 years under Trump being the no party. Grow the fuck up and try and understand that you can't do anything that they can't do. Make a new rule, they will show you how to use it. But by all means do what feels good for the moment. Who cares if they use it to pass a national abortion ban in 3 years."
2,"‚ÄúThe only time Republicans were this extreme is when Obama came in.‚Äù 

Sigh. 

You‚Äôre very close to getting it."
0,"‚ÄúMake a new rule, they will show you how to use it.‚Äù 

Guess the Democrats should just continue to play chess with rules according to how Republicans want them as the pigeons shit all over the chess board, then."
0,"You jumped to Obama without paying attention to my comments on Gingrich first. I can go all the back to the very beginning with the founders. Do you want to start to Thomas Jefferson? Because I‚Äôm pretty sure, the crisis we‚Äôre dealing with as of now is due to DJT and his Russian backed QAnon. BTW, I know what the fake Tea Party did. This thread simply isn‚Äôt dealing with that topic. Trump launched a failed coup d‚Äô√©tat, that‚Äôs an attack on the entire United States government."
2,"Continue to follow the fucking constitution, and rules that have stood for a hundred years. Make some new ones, and you better believe they are going to show you how to use them."
0,"And you‚Äôre, for some reason, just forgetting about that whole era when Republicans embraced McCarthyism, or maybe that‚Äôs just good government.

Or when the Republican Party embraced the southern strategy. 

Or when the Republican Party essentially stole the 2000 election. 


Again, the crisis we‚Äôre dealing with now did not start with Trump. 

The insurrection on the Capitol was the inevitable conclusion. 

McCain gave us Sarah Palin. 

Murkowski and Collins and Romney aren‚Äôt the good guys that are going to help us save democracy. 

There are no moderate Republicans, and haven‚Äôt been any moderate Republicans in a long time. 

We‚Äôve had multiple opportunities to stop this crisis from unfolding, it‚Äôs just the Democratic Party, in spite of all evidence to the contrary, continued to at least pretend to believe the GOP was operating in good faith, until the insurrection happened. 

Anyways, I think we‚Äôre both basically in agreement and on the same side. 

I just think our crisis began well before Trump and the insurrection happened."
0,"It‚Äôs fun how you think the Republicans are gonna give a damn about the Constitution when they take back control in 2022.

Anyway, the filibuster wasn‚Äôt originally part of the constitution."
0,"Democrats need to finally learn from the GOP. Judges, nobody gets approved during an election year unless it's Dem appointed PERIOD, NO EXEPTIONS EVER. With the abortion law in Texas, Dems, listen to me, USE THIS PRECIDENCE TO GO AFTER GUNS. In the Dem states, outlaw all firearms and use the people to enforce it. That's the key, if the State isn't enforcing the law, the law can't be challenged, law stands. Come on Dems, I know it's not in your passive nature, but let's get tough, it's time. ""But we don't want to stoop to their level"", grow up and start winning for once"
0,"This is so true. We consistently underestimate the ruthlessness of the GOP, and refuse to take a stand no matter how badly they abuse us."

2,"> Opinion

Fact, actually."
0,"If GOP cheats and lies, then they aren't ""for America"", right?

They should be dismantled for being anti-American, or unconstitutional, or something. They are making a mockery of our country, and Not supporters at all, right?"
2,"So very true.

When your objective is destruction and division your job is  much easier than actually trying to build something."
0,"Universal Healthcare. Abortion Rights. Voting Rights. Climate Change Policies. Are not going hard left. These are basic facts of most if not all major economies. 

In Canada ‚Äúgoing hard left‚Äù is talking about UBI or drug program (already available for 65+) or free dental care. 

‚ÄúModerates‚Äù in the US need to look at how the rest of major economies work."
2,"Standing still and status quo are not providing any results. 


So what else you got?"
0,"There is no such thing as a moderate democrat at this point. A good example is Joe Biden. Joe is now, because the GOP has shifted so far right, basically a 1980's republican. You are either progressive or in the wrong party."
0,"Well‚Ä¶..that‚Äôs what the GOP does. They minimize their failures and maximizes others.

And don‚Äôt say that ‚Äúboth sides are the same‚Äù. This meme is the first I knew about the four killed in Niger."

2,"My headcanon about this is that Sean Spicer convinced him it didn't happen because if he did deliver remarks about it, there was a 100% chance of him mispronouncing 'Niger' on camera."
2,Thanks now I can pass this info on to my Republican Father.
0,"By putting our ally Chad, on the no fly list, trumpy caused the death of these four soldiers. When trumpy did this, Chad immediately pulled their soldiers out if the area. It was the first day going out looking for insurgents without the aid of soldiers from Chad. Why weren't there tons of investigations into this? Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi, though."
0,"So the trouble with the right wing is that nothing is hypocritical to them because the way they think is that as long as it serves their political goals it's right and proper. 

This is so fundamental that they're not capable of true hypocritical thinking because their so backwards that they can't line the two hypocritical thoughts up. 

George Orwell called it ""Double Think"" and it's legit terrifying."
0,Buttery mails! SMH. I hate the GOP
0,"And let's not forget that he had no business being there--apparently it was some kind of favor to Putin, and he sent mercenary soldiers, not Marines, who then left behind the soldiers, including one who was still alive, but then ambushed and mutilated (that's the one whose mother he said ""he knew what he was getting into"" to).   He caused their deaths.   

The even worse hypocrisy was their absolute radio silence on this--Trump literally CAUSING the needless deaths of four American soldiers--after years and years and years of screaming about Benghazi (which was an attack on the US Embassy in a known hotspot, the same as other attacks during the Bush and Reagan presidencies--AND Hillary had requested add'l security, and the GOP had refused it)."
0,"And four Nigerien troops were killed too. 

Also, a typical Trumpian ""Blame Obama"" attack: 

>On 17 October, during a press conference, Trump was asked about his silence by a reporter and commented on the incident. Trump responded by saying that he wrote letters to the families of the victims, and accused his predecessors, specifically President Obama, of not or rarely calling the families of deceased soldiers."
0,The GOP does this because they get away with it every time.
0,"He also got a SEAL killed in his first military action. Crickets.

Edit: and this was *just* off of the Benghazi series of investigations that republicans found nothing actionable with, even after 11 hours of sworn testimony.  Imagine Trump in the same situation."
0,"Well, see, in Trump-world the only deaths that count are not under Republican watch.  The rest of the deaths are jack shit."
2,Never forget who Trump and Republicans really are
0,Well got damit we got a real president now LA David Johnson
2,And both parties are the same?
2,"It was on their way back to the home base when they stopped for water at the village of Tongo Tongo, about 120 miles north of Niger‚Äôs capital. There, the group was ambushed by Islamic State-linked militants armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and small firearms."
0,Don't  forget these soldiers were just losers and suckers according to trump
0,"Don't sign up for the military if you don't want to die. My GF's entire family is republican and they asked my opinion about all these deaths happening with the withdrawal from Afghanistan. 

Why do they all of a sudden care about these deaths when we spent 20 years either being killed or killing people?

Fucking blows my mind the stupid shit these people say."
2,"How many lives did we save by leaving Afghanistan? 
Those 15 that died were heroes and they saved potentially 10‚Äôs of thousands of lives. 
This is why we should be talking about. This should be the headlines. 

Instead the rhetoric from the extreme left and right are ruining our country. There‚Äôs a better perspective out there we just have to try a little harder to empathize with our fellow men. We have to become obsessed with making that happen instead of giving in time the easiness of fighting eAchother."
2,"You have the white house, the house and most of the senate, why would you spread 4 year old nonesense. You need to be saying what your doung to imorove the current situation on like 10 different fronts. Stay current or get out voted. Take some responsibility for once. No one cares aboutbthe finger pointing"
1,These solders didn't die because of an absolute shit show of decision making by the president. Soldiers die in war. period. However what happend in Kabul was entirely preventable and a direct result of Bidens botched withdrawal oppertation.
0,"Remember when we just blew off the Kurds, our allies, leaving them to fend against both Assad and the Turks?  But we are incensed at Biden leaving the the Afghans in Afghanistan after getting over 100,000 of them out?"
0,Any time they say they ‚Äòsupport the troops‚Äô this as well as their hostility towards the VA and veterans homelessness and mental health should be brought up immediately.
0,"To be fair, allowing Trump to pronounce Niger would be a very dangerous request."

2,Funny how obsessed with Trump you guys still are lmao
0,Using the deaths of soldiers for political gain is an incredibly low thing to do. Do not sink to the Republicans level.

2,"Mhmm. Absolutely zero ability to self reflect at all and think ‚Äòhey maybe the way I‚Äôm going about this is wrong or hypocritical?‚Äô

Like the way they think Muslims and other religions are so *obviously* wrong but can‚Äôt apply those same critical thinking skills to their own religion. Like if a Muslim believed just as fervently as a Christian did, don‚Äôt you believe they think their religion is the one true one just like they do?"

2,Good call. I try to pay attention to whataboutism but sometimes it's easy to miss.
2,How many republicans have attended trump rally‚Äôs after the election he lost.?
0,Trump couldn't remember her husband's name.
1,Not sure how it minimizes Biden‚Äôs failures in any way
2,"He wasn't the center of attention, how is a mentally deranged narcissist supposed to react?"
0,"I always shudder with amazement how any veteran could ever support Trump over Biden in any way. The difference between the two on Veteran's issue is about as far apart as one could get:

2,"Same.

Glad I served under a Commander in Chief that I respected."
0,"Okay... but we've been pointing out literally this meme over and over again since like, 2004 at least. 

""No way they could make John Kerry look like a pussy, he was a highly decorated combat veteran while GW was getting high in Texas"" 

""They've said all this stuff about Obama being a Kenyan Muslim who eats dogs, but they'll HAVE to change their tune now that bin Laden is dead""

""No way that Republicans in Kentucky would pick swamp thing Mitch McConnell over a distinguished Air Force pilot with all the funding in the world""

It's like dude, you don't get it... these people could not give less of a shit about ""the troops"" or ""the flag"" and they certainly don't care about being caught up in some technical hypocrisy. They like cruelty, they like the war. They love that violence is being done to people who they dislike, that's all. It's a really simple, yet totally terrifying."
0,"I don‚Äôt know what this means. For 4 years we demanded trump stop talking about all the things he said Hillary did wrong - now Biden wins and we‚Äôre talking about all the things trump did wrong. 

I know it doesn‚Äôt go over well in the Reddit hive mind but Biden won. Trumps out. We need to stop talking about him and hold our current politicians accountable for the good and the bad."
0,"Not sure how  trump blaming Hillary, who was never president, has anything to do with democrats calling out republican hypocrisy. Granted I don't follow Biden‚Äôs press conferences very closely but I can't seem to recall him trump or Pence by name very often at all."
0,"The problem with your position is that it ignores that Trump did everything he could to sabotage Biden. And his appointees have been slowed down. You are aware that Ted Cruz has prevented Biden's State Dept appointees from being confirmed, right?"
0,"This post is focused on the hypocrisy of republicans not the fact that both during Trump and Bidens administration US soldiers died.

Calling everything that calls out hypocrisy ""whataboutism"" is dishonest at best and malicious at worst."
0,"It still occasionally blows my mind, everything else about him aside, that the media acted like it was a big deal that at George Bush's funeral, Trump didn't make it about himself. They acted like it was a big deal that *the president* behaves with the decorum I'd expect from a healthy 5 year old."
1,"I‚Äôm talking about this post - per my prior comments. 

Why are we pulling up how trump behaved? He‚Äôs out. Biden‚Äôs in. Saying ‚Äúreminder - this is his trump behaved‚Äù comes across as saying ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs ok Biden screwed this up because what about trump!‚Äù 

I‚Äôm fine being in the minority on this opinion I just wish the left would stop being so hypocritical."
0,"Come on. It is honestly, literally, ‚Äúwhat about what Trump did, it was way worse‚Äù at least be big enough to admit it. I am And I was saying in 2015, ‚Äúwhat the fuck, Trumpty Dumpty is a freakin sociopath, NO! ‚Äú"
2,"I think you're misinterpreting the ""it's fine Biden screwed up"" aspect, I don't get the impression he's being let off the hook. I can't blame anyone for continuing to highlight the previous administration's shortcomings in comparable situations to what the current one is being held brutally accountable for."
2,"You can interpret it that way if you want but I don't understand it that way. The title calls out the Republican hypocrisy for blasting Biden now while being fine with Trump back in 2017.

By that standard calling out the different reactions to similar situations aka hypocrisy is from now on always ""whataboutism"" and we will no longer be able to call out hypocrisy at all.

Also what is blasted here is neither the situation leading up to the events nor the failures that led to them but rather the reaction to them."
2,"dude isn't this post and entire context just Dems doing the same, i.e blasting trump back in 2017 and being fine with Biden now? You can change the text to ""Your reminder that when four American soldiers were killed in niger in 2017 Dems raised hell"" and title to ""Dems hypocrisy"" and post it on one of the conservative subs and it'll fit right in.

I've experienced political shithousry in other countries but it's on another level in the US, ~~politicians~~ actually more the supporters, of both sides do the same thing when their guy is not in power. They also do the same thing when your guy is in power. When trump was in t_d was all about obama and drone strikes and now all the dem subs are *but trump did worse*."
1,"So what exactly would you call a ‚Äúwhataboutism‚Äù then? It is bringing up a perceived misdeed, of the past, from the opposition, to deflect from the criticism of a current situation. Exactly what this is. Just like when the Trump supporters would bring up Clinton or Obama to avoid addressing things Trump did. (Sure he might‚Äôve said ‚Äúgrab ‚Äòem by the pussy‚Äù but that was just locker room talk. Clinton actually sexually harassed his underlings) Doesn‚Äôt that sound familiar?"
0,"Dunno in which reality you live but while there are certainly die hard democrats who see no fault in what Biden does the amount of worship Trump gets from republicans is on a whole different level.

There is literally a hearing about the Afghanistan withdrawal initiated by democrats about the Afghanistan withdrawal.

Trump instigated a mob to storm the capitol and got much less heat from republicans than Biden now gets from democrats.

 just as an example.

So no. It is not even close on both sides and thinking that both sides do the exact same thing is again either misinformed or just plain dishonest."
0,"Right. I am a lifelong Democrat but I am not so eat up with partisan bullshit that I deny the obvious. When we do it we are pointing out hypocrisy, when they do it they are deflecting. Ok, live the delusion."
2,"It is exactly as you describe it. Whataboutism is bringing up something that you think was worse to make another mistake seem less bad.

I only disagree that this is the intention of this post. The intention is as I read it to make people remember how different republicans REACTED to the things Trump did wrong compared to how they react to Bidens mistakes now.

The huge difference to me is that the title attacks republicans for their hypocrisy and does not focus on whether Trump or Bidens mistakes were worse."
2,"I was never questioning the validity of the complaint, one way or the other. I was simply pointing out that it is the same tactic. Don‚Äôt you understand that the right also believe they are pointing out the hypocrisy of the left when they do it?"
0,Well duh ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre gerrymandering districts and making it difficult for dems to vote.  American democracy at work.
0,"We‚Äôre still in a battle for the soul. If America chooses not to vote blue in 2024 we‚Äôve lost the battle. After all this bullshit it‚Äôs just amazing people can‚Äôt find away to vote. The US wouldn‚Äôt be the first country to slide into fascism. That said, a good sign will be if Newsom wins the recall by a large margin. But look a CA 48th district, after all the crap Democrats don‚Äôt show up to vote."
0,I'm going to say something controversial:  Fani Willis does not think she can find 12 people that would convict Donald Trump.  She knows that there would be jury nullification.  I mean they have Trump on the phone clearly interfering with the Georgia election.  It doesn't matter.  Trump would have enough supporters that would vote not guilty even if they saw him shoot someone on fifth avenue.
2,"Do you not already do that?

It's how I warm up my clicking finger. Hop on YouTube, report hate speech, watch cat videos. Work done well."
0,Fox News has all comments turned off? Are there other ways to find assholes making asshole comments?
0,"It's unlikely to go anywhere unless Tucker starts just using full-on racial epithets.

Most of the mainstream rightwing stuff is careful enough to keep things duplicitous enough for plausible deniability. ""We weren't calling *Mexicans* criminals, we were calling *immigrants* criminals!"" If something is *unambiguously* racist or hate speech, then yeah go ahead and report."
2,"I don‚Äôt want YouTube to censor anything but those shouldn‚Äôt them up on my searches or recommendation unless I use ‚ÄúFox News‚Äù in the search box. YouTube promotes hate videos on my search that‚Äôs my problem, for PR they block bunch of videos but they allow most videos to appear on your searches. Tech companies has to fix the algorithm but they are scared it will affect the user activity on their app."
2,"I‚Äôve just stopped looking at YouTube‚Äôs news channels. The comments, no matter who‚Äôs in office, are full of whining babies I couldn‚Äôt care less about. They need to find something better to do rather than being pathetic losers who talk to the 10,000 other losers also trying to ‚Äòmake an impact?‚Äô about the political situation. I too watch Fox News for comedy. ~~F~~Tucker once started saying we should all identify as the opposite gender to break records and that shit was hilarious."
0,"Well, no shit. All these recounts, and law suits. Now the insurrection. They are doing their best to destroy the country."
2,What exactly does Reich mean when he says Democrats need to wake up? Is he implying that there's reticence towards change and crushing these freaks? Reich is great but I expect a little more than just foot stomping and demanding the magic wand that doesn't exist. The only Democrats need to wake up about is freaking VOTING. The end.
2,They are making it legitimate by filing lawsuits. People follow news but never the actual hearings. US should have spent more on education and critical thinking programs in schools.
0,"Frankly, if Democrats don‚Äôt show up to vote the country will slide into fascism. Look at Texas, Georgia and Florida. That restaurant in Florida that doesn‚Äôt allow Biden voters as patrons should clue people in. You just can‚Äôt expect to not vote and have things fall in your lap."
0,"Republicans have the audacity to speak on accountability. 

Griffith is in the Sedition Caucus and hasn't called for any accountability for any of Trump's actions. He hasn't supported any efforts to hold people accountable for He votes lockstep with his fellow Republicans no matter what is best for his constituents or the country. 

Republicans are trying to keep the focus on the feigned outrage over Afghanistan."
0,I got an idea Rep Griffith can resign.
0,How bout all of them with involvement in the Jan6 insurrection resign.  And Trump negotiated that withdrawal deal.
1,"Andy was a Democrat, and Liberal.  This guy is a piece of shit."
0,"I started a Canva project tonight for it. Seems easy enough. Just need to populate it with good, articulate Dem ideas.
I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm going to focus on our position rather than ‚Äúother guys are bad‚Äù."
2,"

Click on ""Download the Party Platform"" and take a look at ours.

You have to be careful; your state group wants to kind of oversee what literature is put out. Simply because the Dem messaging should be consistent and fact-based. 

Are you working with your county party? Your County Chair should know what to do. Or your Congressional District Chair."
2,"Yes, that's exactly what you want to do. Facts and information about what Dems are doing and want to do.. not all negativity about Rs. 

What state are you in? You should be able to look at your state party platform. See what your party is doing at the state level and integrate that with info relative to your community."
2,Yes I reached out to my county parties chair to ensure we are getting something out. She agreed with my assessment and hadn‚Äôt realized how short we were on any kind of resource for the tables.
2,To be honest I started working not even considering the state or county Dem party could have different So thanks for that idea.
0,No walls... The idea of a border wall is so stupid. Regardless of where you put it. Oregonians  talk about one on our southern border all the time. Lol the Cali's would just come through Nevada. A boycott would be a cheaper solution.
0,Pretty crappy solution for all the Texas Democrats like me that are trying to change things
2,No.  This reminds me too much of my conservative friends talking about doing the same for California or New York.
0,There are some good people in Texas. We can't leave them behind or the Texiban will destroy them.
0,"Better yet:

Let the entire south secede. No war, no guns, no violence. Just paperwork. 

The thing is, no federal money either. 

Let‚Äôs see if the Texas economy is enough to subsidize all those red states without federal supplements.

Hell, they can keep most of the flyover states as well. 

Let‚Äôs just make it the Northeast, the West Coast, and everyone else is all on their own‚Ä¶"
2,So does that mean men do have a voice when it comes to abortion now? Or does that not compute?
1,Then shouldn‚Äôt us men get a seat at the table for the abortion discussion now?
1,If you can program A Generation of children to believe this kind of bullshit you can easily convince them that America is systematically racist and the vaccinated can be infected by people that aren‚Äôt sick.
1,"Whats weirder.   Their contradictions in ""science"" or their love for killing babies?"
1,this what happens when allow post modernist scum to overrun your education system
2,"The word ""fact"" has been politicized, unfortunately.  People use it all the time in attempts to shut down arguments, and it really has diminished the meaning of the word."
2,I honestly cannot comprehend the depth of the insanity with these people. It really IS a mental illness.
2,even the devil realises human society is fucked
1,"My god. What is happening with Gen Z? Can't we returning to the old years where there were Girls and Boys, Women and Men?"
1,"Then men have a say in abortion? Is that the new official ""liberal"" stance?"
1,So it's alright to murder a baby because some people with body dismorphia have babies? WTF is wrong with these people?
1,"If you have two X chromosomes, you‚Äôre a female. Last I checked, only humans with two X chromosomes could get pregnant. Doesn‚Äôt matter what you identify as or what your birth cert says. Science in this case is fact and if you are pregnant or have gotten pregnant, you are female"
1,"Let me check if a man ever had a baby. 

Nope. Never. 

You know why? Men do not physically have a vagina. 

That‚Äôs a scientific fact. But reality doesn‚Äôt mean anything to the far-left. If they ‚Äúfeel‚Äù it, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúfact.‚Äù  

The clowns have taken over."
2,"Wait so it's no longer a women's issue because women don't exist. Meaning men CAN have a valid opinion on abortions. Suggesting otherwise suggests that trans men aren't real men.

It is transphobic to say men can't have an opinion on abortions."
1,"And we wonder why mental illness is more prevalent on the left?

It's because from the moment they're born, they are fed nothing but alternate reality, anti-science propaganda. 

How in the blue hell can you not end up messed up if you believe the world is X, only to grow up and discover that 98% of the world is Y and you're part of the 2% that believe otherwise."
2,I have no compassion for the ignorant.
1,"Well let's see, to leftists, wrong is right, bad is good, down is up, and losing is winning."
1,"Because these dummies think a girl can transform into a dude so when she gets pregnant they think men can have babies...

Reading that logic is like trying to follow a psychopath's mind... unpleasant"
1,"hang on , seriously... I think she might be mentally ill ?what she's saying is beyond lefty nonsense its actually genuinely deranged , even the most ardent of Trans ""female"" activists don't think they can get pregnant ?! you sure shes not a troll?"
2,"she should be banned from social media for stupidity, she doesn't even know what fact means"
2,Jen Psaki begs to differ.  She stated clearly that only women could get pregnant and make hard choices re. abortion.
1,"This is the same kind of person that says men can't make laws about women's bodies. Yet, according to her logic, men can get pregnant? Hmmm."
1,Lol Females are defined as having eggs and getting pregnant under the concept of mammals. You can do some sort of procedure to put eggs in men; but that is obviously not  a man anymore it's a cyborg.
2,Idiocracy was not supposed to be a documentary.
2,I didn't know her post meant every single leftist thinks this way. Hmm. ü§î what an educated reddit post title.
1,"Anyone else feel like this whole gender thing is a bit of an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" type situation?"
1,Dang the libs need to go to a mental asylum
2,y'all Americans lmao
1,"Leftism is a truly disease, and a with a quick visit to the Front page of Reddit you can clearly see how badly it devastates brain function."
1,"I'm honestly not sure if they are humans anymore. Wondering if the report and the vaccines have anything to do with one another. Seems more likely Liberals are actually just aliens, body snatchers. The vaccine is the delivery mechanism.  


LOL. Please don't think I'm serious.  


But that's what it feels like."
1,I forgot which ivy league school did a study and found that 64% of those that consider themselves liberals have seen a doctor about mental health issues at least once.
2,What if a female doesn‚Äôt identify with the term woman but can still get pregnant?
2,"I'm pretty sure that in the human species ,the female is the only gender that can get pregnant."
2,"Wait, I don't understand. Someone please clarify.

Is she referring to Female -> Male trans people who still have the female sexual organs necessary to give birth? With the incomplete surgery techniques we have today, it is still possible to get pregnant after the surgery. Wouldn't they would fall into their own category instead of being called a traditional woman?

I don't know if that's what she means. Of course on the surface it looks completely ridiculous, but maybe the above is what she's thinking..?"
1,I never knew stupidity was contagious until I met a leftist and realized they are allowed to reproduce !
1,"I genuinely don't understand how a grown man can vote Democrat. I would rather be associated with *Qanon* or even Flat Earters, than with countless legions of people on the Left, take your pick."
2,"That is true, I heard that people who speak English can get pregnant, that is a fact üòÇüòÇ"

2,So a man has control of his body a woman control of her body? Good to know!
0,"Men: afraid of expanding their vocabulary 

The rest: afraid of not having access to essential health care and human rights. 

Yeah this is a real struggle boys"
0,I‚Äôm going to demand my job give me paid ma‚Äô pa‚Äô ternity then! üòÇ
0,"so what are all of your plans for how long you're going to keep pretending to be surprised trans people exist?

fifteen years, twenty-five years? how long you think you can get out of this"
1,I think that person is referring to how people with different sexual identities can become pregnant. The lack of understanding of this could actually be construed as the brain disease.
2,"To Mrs. Gandy‚Äôs claim, this is true for male seahorses and perhaps some other species I‚Äôm not aware of, but this is not the case for humans.

  My guess is she‚Äôs using the scientific definition of gender while we‚Äôre using the legal definition which basically a polite way of saying sex."
1,"I'm not sure, because of the username, but I'm getting the sense that this is a troll. but maybe not? I'm not sure. The fact that we can't tell the difference tells you something about the left."
1,"Pretty sure it is a scientific fact--short of being an organism that can reproduce asexually--that only females can get pregnant.  Something about that being the rule for pretty much every species with males and females.  The left is nuts.  Just because you believe something, that doesn't make it fact.  It makes it your opinion.  Opinions are not facts and wishing them so will never make it true.

Being trans is fine if that's how a free individual wants to live.  I literally don't care.  However, it is completely false to claim that men can get pregnant.  It is their opinion that men can get pregnant because it is their opinion that men aren't defined by measurable biological sex characteristics.  Men cannot get pregnant.  Women who want to be men can."
1,"Ok I'll bite. 

Please tell me where the logic falls down.

If a women transitions to being a man, yet still had a uterus, then they can get pregnant and therefore an abortion.

I'm not trying to argue. Genuinely can't see what the point of disagreement is."
1,"I get the sneaking sense that that's actually the point of the post, and it's actually not a leftist post, but rather someone trolling the left. The fact that we can't even tell the difference shows how ridiculous the left has become."
1,"They are called birthing people now. Remember.
The word mother was not inclusive enough.
It also sickens me how so many people are so for infant murder."
2,Nope. Just the ones who will be getting the abortion. Full stop.
1,Brain damage from those vegan diets and getting vaccinated every two weeks for a virus that cannot be immunized. Pretty sure that's why they also want to be forced into totalitarian rule. Severe brain damage and extreme dependence on the teet of big government.
1,"Depends on your opinion.  We only believe in diversity of genitalia and race, not thought."
1,"Well... I'm with you but how about this?......   
  For the folks that say a woman can have an abortion if they want and a man has no say so, then the man should be able to decide whether he wants to pay child support or not!"
2,I think it's always been batshit. But so many people have access to the internet now. And stupidity breeds stupidity
1,"Imagine someone saying this just 10 years ago. I guarantee 99% of Democrats would think that this is fucking crazy. 

  
They are just so easily brainwashed."
1,Ever since we started having ‚Äúfact checkers‚Äù which is like the Ministry of Truth in 1984
2,"The opposite of a fact would be a falsehood.


>  A lie is a statement made by one who does not believe it with the intention that someone else shall be led to believe it

Or something close to that at least.  "
1,Seeing people denying this biological fact makes me wish there was an actual way to change your biological sex at will so people will shut up about it.
2,"Well said, with little parenting they are in for a big surprise when they need to bring in income to pay living expenses. No more time to ""protest"" day and night when you have a 9-5 job to attend. my office hires recent college graduates, I have been there over 6 years now, more than ever we are denying candidates after the 1st day working interview. It may be coincidence but so far I see a trend of lazyiness and unwillingness to proactive"
2,She's referring to trans men who haven't got bottom surgery
1,"> The funny thing is that they are right. Transmascs and non-binary people with female genetalia can get pregnant. But watch how quick I get banned, because you don't care about the facts, all you care about is ""FuCk ThE LiBs""

They're not right.  Only women can become pregnant.  Men who pretend they are women are not women and can't become pregnant.  ""Non-binary"" is not a sex.  Humans are male or female.  Females can become pregnant, males cannot."
2,However English speakers born without ovaries can‚Äôt get pregnant. Lol
1,"I don‚Äôt think trans people don‚Äôt exist, I think they living a lie. 

You can‚Äôt simply change your gender and go against science and biology simple because your feeble reptilian brain ‚Äúthinks‚Äù so.

I feel like a potato sometimes, doesn‚Äôt that mean I can identify as one and force my pronouns on others? No, because one you force others to say something, it‚Äôs not about respect and more about manipulation and force.

And back to transgenders, I believe everyone should live their life. If you wanna be XYZ behind closed doors go do so. But don‚Äôt make it my problem, and force yours views on me. I think everyone should love themself for who they are. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on forcing kids to choose a gender. It‚Äôs stupid and pointless. If a child wants to do something, let them do it, unless it could permanently harm them or hurt them, like hormones. And let‚Äôs all agree that a 3 year old might not be able to count their fingers twice and get the same number, let alone choose what they want to be in life. If you were to ask a 3 year old what they wants to be when they grow up, they might say Spider-Man FFS."
2,I'm not surprised they exist. I'm surprised they're allowed out of the asylum.
2,"I'm guessin the whole transitioning part? I align with you but I understand the conservatism on this.

One has to understand that LGBTQ community is a part of world's culture not just America. It's a global community. One that can't be done away with."
2,"I had someone I work with comment on Facebook the exact sentiment of the op, unironically. Some really do think this."
1,I mean yeah.. The left is ridiculous... But the right is taking horse dewormer for a virus that doesn't exist....
1,So why do Cali libs care about Texas abortion laws then? ü§î
1,"I always see liberal media say ""What is the Republican Party's obsession with blue hair?"" and play dumb in the article, as if there couldn't be a more obvious indicator of political beliefs by the cookie cutter look that has evolved. It's funny. I have nothing against blue hair, I just think it's funny that obvious signaling is presented as a united front for those that support the politics behind it, and act like it's surprising that other people notice it."
2,"Back in my day, crazy hair and clothes were our way of rebelling against government and authority. Just like everything they steal it. Now to rebel I have to look normal. The future is stupid."
2,Like Trump's?
1,I‚Äôm pointing out the obvious hypocrisy of the left saying men can‚Äôt weigh in on abortion debate but also men can get pregnant.
2,Exactly. Before most people would just tell them to shut the fuck up. But now they find each other online and continue the echo chamber
1,XXY is sterile so don‚Äôt have to worry about abortions
1,"the term trans men its purely  a term I use to be polite , they are not men and never will be men  ..science"
1,"A person who identifies as male but was born with female parts can get pregnant, fact."
2,Because its a societal issue... Not a state issue.
1,"Hm? I didn‚Äôt say that at all. I said if a man is pregnant, then that man should have the right to decide what to do with his own body."
1,"Oh I know, I'm agreeing and just saying they don't care about the hypocrisy at all. 
 They only care to hear the opinions of those who fall in line with their insanity, while hypocritically claiming they care about diversity."
1,"They can identify as whatever they want, but this hypothetical person is still a female. An XX biological female human being. Female is a biological term. Whatever is going on inside their head doesn't change their biological sex."
2,"What lie? 

The left IS ridiculous.

The right IS taking horse dewormer."
1,But men can't call it a societal issue because.......? (Insert elitist liberal hypocritical nonsense here)
1,A man can't get pregnant.  I think you mean a woman who identifies as a man.
2,she lives in a fantasy world where her weird world view is universal and uses language like things  have  already been decided in her favor even  though the  vast majority don't agree with her at all
2,There are actually very experimental surgeries on uterus transplants for Trans going M to F but I doubt they mean that since you wouldn't need a abortion if you are actually trying to get pregnant with a huge rare experimental surgery unless something went wrong.
2,"The virus does exist.

Ivermectin is not horse dewormer."
2,The medicine that won't a Nobel Prize in 2015 for its effects on humans? Gtfoh you dipshit. Google shit before you embarrass yourself anymore.
0,Because no one should control another persons body - there was a war about this or something
2,No I mean a man who was assigned female at birth but is a man. But there can of course also be an intersex or nonbinary person who has a uterus.
2,"The first sentence is just blatantly false. Without surgery that is just not the case, except in a super small percentage of genetic mutation cases. Almost universally males have XY and females have XX. This observation is also universal in every mammal on earth"
2,"Sarcasm also exists... Its been the stance of conservatives that covid is a fake for a while... I was being sarcastic.

It is also a cattle-dewormer. And works on PARASITES

Covid... Is a virus."
2,"So much wrong. 

Its an anti-parasite. It won said prize for its work vs parasites. 

Covid is a virus. 

Full stop. 

PS. It 'won' a NPP, not 'won't.' But keep telling others not to embarrass themselves."
1,Then explain how the left is still calling this a wAr oN WoMeN
1,Removed and banned for liberal talking points.
1,"I never met or seen a conservative that believed the virus was fake. Not even Trump. 

Also Ivermectin is IN some horse dewormers, it's primary purpose for being is not as a horse dewormer."
0,"Yes. Trump did call it a hoax. (Which is another way of saying fake) 

Its still only effective against parasites... 

Covid is still a virus."
1,"No... I 'got you' on the definition of a virus v a parasite... The rest was to prove you're full on dumb not just half way. 

Dr's, much like states are unfortunately, woefully, pathetically inequal. Its like comparing the basic humanity of Texas vs Cali, its not a proper comparison. 

Those Dr's should lose their jobs."
2,Yet it IS an parasite med being used for a virus... It deserves the agro.
1,What if you're a pregnant woman? Then it's okay? Just trying to understand the liberal nuance of justifying any and all immoral stances in order to personally benefit
2,I mean if you want to deny him the respect of telling you what he means. The media and leftists were the only ones who thought he meant the virus itself wasn't real.

Billions of dollars goes into creating lies and propaganda because it works. This isnt JFK democrat party anymore or the Bush Republican party.

1,It‚Äôs crazy how liberal Reddit is. I think it‚Äôs brainwashing voter bots or something it‚Äôs like the plague. I‚Äôve considered deleting it because most everyone on here is a Biden dick rider. Nice to see some like minded people on here
1,"Wouldn't ""Dump Joe Biden"" be more accurate?  I mean..I doubt even Jill wants to fuck him."
2,cant believe someone would vote for that douche unreal how dumb people are
1,"Joe Biden is the most professional loser I've ever seen. The guy has gotten away with plagiarism throughout his ""career"", election fraud, having a piece of shit son etc. I doubt Democrats will remain in power after 2022-24 if their house of cards start falling next few years."
2,"Someone named Orange_Star commented on me somehow treading on a groups domain. Sorry to say it this way, but I love my republican brothers and sisters, and I could have once called myself one. Now all I do is watch others be radicalized in an echo chamber of absolute nonsense. 

And I‚Äôm even more annoyed to see it working. The radical right and left want chaos and destruction. I want peace and freedom. Also I like to make people think a little deeper about what it is they‚Äôre saying. Usually it‚Äôs a bunch of bs."
2,"History's most boring president. He needs to go to a Nascar event and talk about loving God, the tremendous support he has, crowd sizes, etc."
2,"I disagree slightly, not all Democrats are assholes, many of them are good people. The Democratic Party is not the same as the Radical Left. We need the Democratic and Republican Parties to have this country run as intended. We should instead just be chanting the names of people who have changed this country for the worse and have ended thousands of human lives and hold them accountable. Such as Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Patrisse Cullors, Antifa, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and so on..."
2,Wisconsin state I believe.
1,"The Democrats stole the 2020 election, Biden never won in the first place.  But this might all be a blessing in disguise... the incompetence and radical agenda of the Biden administration is showing the country what the left is really about and hopefully that will result in a landslide victories for republicans in 2022."
1,"Sorry.  We were too busy at work.  Checking in at lunch here.  This is pathetic and idiotic.  Biden is a terrible President and I desperately hope the we can put up a candidate who can defeat him in 24, but this accomplishes nothing more than making Republicans look like a moronic fan club to anyone in the middle."
1,Nah. This is who we are. Fuck Joe Biden.
2,"Attacking governments is kinda what Patriots do, hate to break it to you."
1,"You're not entirely wrong, but it must be remembered that Democrats collectively and repeatedly vote to put the radical left in charge.

If you hand the radicals the keys to the bus, and keep giving them gas money, knowing they are radicals, you don't get to claim it isn't your responsibility when the bus goes off a cliff."
2,It just seems like you have no real Argument or point to make against us although you're still angry and so you're just insulting us based on no logic or proof behind your claim. What's irredeemably sad is the fact that you have no leg to stand on and so you're clinging to insults you would hear a 9 year old saying instead of admitting that you're wrong
1,"I share this opinion too. Biden never truly won, I watched it happen on election night and the days after. Although because he's in office now it seems like its given Democrats a taste of what they actually voted for."
1,"Are you serious? Liberal Leftists are the ones trying to disband and overthrow the Government, The Patriots are trying to protect our Free Nation and Government. Patriots wouldn't be supporting America if they weren't supporting the United States Government. Here is the very definition of Patriotic:

"
2,"Not all of them, a lot of them yes but even some Republicans listen to the left"
1,Latest polls show it would still be a close election. That‚Äôs how much the left hates Trump. They would rather vote for the second worst possible person for the job that ran as a democrat.
1,"I saw it happen with my own eyes, in Pennsylvania at my local voting place.  We were given the paper ballots and told to fill in our choices with black sharpies, then slide the ballot into this machine that supposedly read the ballots.  The problem was, the sharpies were bleeding through the front-and-back ballots leaving numerous ""extra"" sharpie circles.  Several of us demanded new ballots that we would fill in with regular pens but were told NO, we had to do it their way.  There's no way that any ballot reader machine was getting the correct reading on those ballots.  This was in a top critical county that went Trump in 2016 that normally leans slightly left so no surprise they went out of their way to cheat."
2,"I do notice they show the teleprompter when trump is talking, whereas they don‚Äôt when Biden is talking."
1,"Auxilary, this Subreddit is for Republicans to discuss issues relating to the Republican Party, you have no right to come into our Domain and try to silence us, not to mention making an uncalled for, personal attack on a Reddit user for their username.

1,"Combination of that, but even moreso the fact that the Dems have morphed into a party that doesn't care about morals, truth, facts, or results..  And are obsessed with handouts, freebies, white racism, and wokeism.  They've successfully managed to delude the younger generation on all this. 

So they're going to get at least 45-50% of the vote no matter who is running."

1,"If this is false I would sue for sure...cnn , fake news as always."
2,Total norm for CNN Fox ought to run a fake story about Lemon and Fredo Cuomo being closet crossdressers and Wolf Blitzer being a Deceptacon.
1,Def sue cnn then we can see what else cnn lies about
2,"It‚Äôs the use of the term ‚Äúhorse de-wormer‚Äù that is fake. Per Merck‚Äôs website, ivermectin is to be used to treat the nematodes of a certain parasite in livestock and humans. Also per their website, ‚Äúno scientific basis for potential therapeutic effect against covid 19 from pre-clinical studies. No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with covid 19. A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.‚Äù Merck is the company that created ivermectin."
1,"Of course they‚Äôre willing to lie to push a narrative. This is nothing new. 

Most all ‚Äújournalists‚Äù are far-left activists. They‚Äôll happily push anything, no matter how ridiculous, to ‚Äòprove‚Äô that anybody that doesn‚Äôt think like them is an idiot.

1,Sue for sure. It is defamation of character. It would be an easy win. Then donate winnings to Project Veritas. Nick Sandmann won. CNN needs to be prosecuted.
2,"I guess that I am by definition a RINO given that I do vote Republican but only because they represent more of my positions than Democrats.  I'm pretty centrist politically speaking.  So, please pardon me if I'm not one of the folks this sub is supposed to be for.  But I just feel it necessary to point out how intellectually bizarre the rhetoric against Ivermectin is.

Now, I'm not an anti-vax guy.  I've had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine and have no problem getting a booster if it's necessary.  I was also one of the first people in my state to get COVID in March of last year.  But I respect everybody's choice about what to do with their own bodies.  I'm not taking a position against anyone's rights or decisions.  The point I'm making is solely to reveal what I believe to be an intellectual weakness in the anti-Ivermectin crowd's arguments.

The anti-Ivermectin crowd rails against it because it's ""not meant for humans"" and other similar arguments.  However, Ivermectin is FDA-approved for human use.  And do you know what is **not** FDA-approved?  **The vaccine.**  

So, here you have these people insulting your intelligence over the fact that some folks are taking a drug originally not meant for humans but that eventually became FDA-approved for human use and recognized as having legitimate, beneficial uses in humans.  But those same people are out there pushing crazy ideas like vaccine mandates and prison time if you don't get a substance shot into your arm that is **not** FDA-approved.  

I'm not usually one to just lay into somebody and call them dumb, but in this case, I think it's safe to say that many of these anti-Ivermectin people are, in fact, dumb.  At the very least, they fail to see the intellectual inconsistencies in their positions.  One can only assume that if those same people were diagnosed with a blood clotting disorder that they would refuse to allow a doctor to prescribe them Warfarin.  You know, since Warfarin is rat poison."
2,You may want to check Merck‚Äôs website in regards to ivermectin in regards to covid. They are the company that created ivermectin.
1,"At this point we might as well be a monarchy where the is a figure head. Our country is ran as a buisness. Import, import, import, spend, spend, spend. Money runs this country as do the corporations. Politicians are men and women trained in manipulation and word play through their education. They gain power, maybe for selfish or selfless reasoning but it always ends up with them stuffing their pockets. 

How else you think things dimwitted democrats have such money? Pelosi is worth over $100m. She didn't get that by GIVING like they all say they want us to do. Big pharma and many, many other corporations pay them off. They talk about being Sweden or Switzerland but that'll never happen when you run a poorly managed buisness where more money leaves what its ment for to go to pockets of assholery. 

Sorry for the rant. Been alittle wound up recently."
2,It is 100% idk msm is claiming people are doing this. A hospital had to come out and deny that a doctor said they could not accept gunshot patients sue to beds being full of people who died in this.
2,"The Pfizer vaccine is FDA approved though, at least for ages 16+"
2,"You almost had it then lost it in the second paragraph.  Corruption runs deep in congress. Not a left side or right side. NRA, oil and fuel companies funds GOP .  Green energy  pharm funds the left. Problem is no term limits. Problem is the middle class and lower class working people cant afford to donate $10k to their representatives to keep them in a seat in congress. So what does congress do? Look to the top 1% for funds. In return, bills and laws are passed that are more in line with corporations than in line with we the people. Our donations are petty and not enough for them. 

Our founding fathers warned us of a two party system. Its destroying our country.  Last time this country came together was/2001. There was no hate against race, religion and sex within America against  each other. that didn't matter. Now we cant even come together for a virus thats making millions of people sick making 10s of thousands of people die. My parents were and still is trump supporters but they still took their chance on science  and took the vax.

My opinion. Our country is more in line with Corporatocracy than anything else."
1,"yeah its sad people dont wonder where people like Pelosi life long grifters worthless insects , that have done ZERO worth mentioning , get so much money from ,"
1,"The rest aren't, though, which is the whole point.  The whole ""get the vaccine"" crowd have pushed any vaccine you can get your hands on.  And they've been doing it since well before the Pfizer vaccine was approved, so the fact that it is approved now doesn't give them a leg to stand on.  They still pushed experimental substances that were not FDA-approved to be forced on people while using disgusting rhetoric against people who tried other experimental treatments.  It was always an intellectually dishonest position."

2,"If you watch the video, there appears to be a line of people standing in the background.  My guess is this video was taken during an election.

2,"I honestly don't think it is going to have much of an impact. I deal with hiring in Florida where the extra benefits were gone over 2 months ago, and it has only gotten more scarce. Way more scarce if I am honest.

I would assume it extends variably to the rest of the country, but only speaking for my area, the major problem seems to be key industries not recovering fully hold back others. The biggest one I hear from prospects  is childcare. Many childcare facilities that existed pre-covid don't exist now. And the ones that do charge significantly more than they did before, because supply is low and demand is high, so they can easily. Everyone knows childcare is expensive, but when it goes up 30 or 50 or 100% or more over a year, many of the people who were working just dont make sense anymore unless they get a raise or a different job, and thats IF you can find one that can and will take your money. Theres waiting lists everywhere for childcare.

There's been a return somewhat to having a stay at home mom or dad in many families because working where they worked before is now negative money. Our economy has been used to having more adults in the labor force, as opposed to a single household earner. A return to that in any significant percentage easily continues the trend we are in now. Low supply and crazy demand."
2,I see the economic collapse is still coming together right on schedule.
1,"With how much they were getting from unemployment I personally know 2 or 3 people who just saved that money to continue living without working for any wages, eventually those savings will run out but this whole thing has really made people lazy as all hell."
2,I‚Äôm sure another ‚Äúrelief bill‚Äù is on the way
1,Unemployment shouldn't be a way of living. Nobody should be on unemployment for more than a month or so.
2,"Speaking as someone who was laid off because of COVID last year and who was using the extra benefits, it's about time. After I got laid off, I qualified for a state program that I used to go back to school 100% paid for, and have about a year left until I graduate. Trying to find work in the IT field with no experience is tough though."
2,I just wanna know what all these fucking Marines are gonna do to keep busy...
2,Most people in the states with low cost of living will just collect regular unemployment since they probably have a pretty nice savings. Imo I don‚Äôt think the labor market will return to pre covid levels until next year.
2,Good news their are 10 million job openings
1,"This is not the time to spike the football.  Unemployment benefits are a smokescreen wedge issue that Democrats are going to use to climb back over the ledge that Afghanistan, COVID and the economy pushed them off.  The campaign ads write themselves: ""Republicans want people off benefits so they can go back to the jobs that are in demand: servile, demeaning unskilled labor that keep people in a cycle of poverty for generations.""  Instead of letting the clock run out, maybe conservatives should have come together to push policy that expanded the middle class.  That way, when Democrats did block it (because it has Republican names on it), they would have to eat more shit at the ballot box.  Instead, our guys handed them a W, it's fucking retarded."

1,"I caught imagery of DDL at the end of ‚ÄúThere will be Blood.‚Äù These benefits, IMHO, have been a harsh detriment on the country for the past 9 months. At first, yes, of course, these benefits were needed and wholesomely welcomed. But then the prolonged shutdowns  and stay at home orders created this golem in humans; which was lazy, un-dedicated and slothful. Maybe some of these people already had this golem in them and these benefits just fed into it more. Maybe some of these people were hard workers and developed this golem because of the hardy benefits. Whatever this case, the government should be held accountable for this, but they won‚Äôt."
2,There‚Äôs 9Million jobs open right now - staffing levels are still going to be difficult for the lowest paid jobs.
2,well the unemployment numbers will go down

0,"I know a couple families where the mother worked at daycare and the children were there on a discounted rate. Closed. Mom now stays at home. 

In my area most mothers go from full time to part time to save on daycare costs after having a child. Also these are high paying jobs for some of these woman. But what about the single moms with a bad ex. No family in the area or they have jobs to go to. So they can‚Äôt watch the children. She is soul provider and she was an essential work. Kids couldn‚Äôt go daycare because it was closed. But she has to pay the bills?  Daycare closes and the other places are either full or can‚Äôt expand. So mom starts staying at home. 

There is more to this whole unemployment debacle than Times out! Fill out those job apps suckers! 

What‚Äôs the answer? I do not know."

2,"Well yes, but actually no. But also yes. But of course no. This is a far more complex topic than it may seem. 
Some people are not very employable.
Some people are eager to work, but the job market sucks ass.
Some people need to stay home to care for others, yet they need any kind of income to survive themselves and pay for housing.
Some people are in between certain phases. Their cole mining days are over, but they need some more months/ years to graduate their new degree or trade academy. After that they may need some months to land a job.

Reasons are plenty, solutions are sparse."
1,Depends on how insecure Nancy is feeling this week.  They may find themselves sleeping in parking garages in DC again.
2,How many pay a living wage?
1,"Paying for what? 

Unemployment benefits are paid from unemployment insurance... which was not increased. In reality our children will pay for this in the future"
1,"If you want to expand the middle class, secure the border and deport the illegals.  Then those unskilled and low skilled labor jobs will have to pay more in order to get American workers to do them."
2,"My neighbor says his job is ""drinking beer."" Accused me of stealing his cigarettes, which I don't smoke. Then had his daughter, whom I've heard her yelling at him for stealing her money(to buy accuse me of being a thief.... I eventually called her ""stupid""(that's literally the worst thing I said) after trying to calmly explain things, then she started crying. I really didn't care at this point and went inside. So they called the cops on me for that. Obviously, the cops didn't believe I committed any crime."
2,"This seems counterintuitive.  If unemployment benefits have run out and jobs are available, then why would staffing levels be difficult?"
2,"You do realize many, many people were only unemployed because their workplace closed down and went out of business? And the only reason that happened was because the government made them go out of business by making it illegal or so difficult for people to patronize said businesses? 

But no I guess they're just lazy fools, according to you"
2,"I‚Äôve been on that sub before, it‚Äôs pretty nuts. The thing is, with those people, they keep using the argument of ‚Äúwe have the ability to provide for everyone without working, so why do we have to work?‚Äù The problem is, the only way you can provide for someone who doesn‚Äôt work is to have someone else provide that work. Someone has to work to build that house you‚Äôre living in. Someone has to work to hunt and gather that food you are eating. Someone has to work to research, create, manufacture, assemble, and deliver that iPhone to you. Someone has to work to keep the cell towers and satellites operating so you can continue to browse Instagram and tik tok. Someone has to work to provide you your avocado toast. Someone has to work in order for you to go to college and learn about gender studies and medieval romance literature.

So in other words, SOMEONE is going to have to work, they just don‚Äôt want it to be them."
2,They think the government should just print unending sums of money and give it to everyone basically
1,"I haven't found / read any hardcore posts. Only read about people disappointed by capitalistic exploitations, big corpo and mismanagement. Since covid and andrew yang the voices for universal basic income have multiplied in all countries not just the us of a.
I also read occasionally a few guys favoring working from home, aiming for self employment or just better work conditions so they don't feel like they are selling their soul and life for meh payment.

I haven't dug deep though. Am sure there are some nutjobs to find."
1,They are waiting for trickle up economics to kick in. They just need more free money to prove it to us
1,they have no sense of economics and just blame everything on the rich as if they inherited every last cent of their wealth
2,"I read some of their comments. It's mostly about ""not working your ass off"" but having a reasonable work life balance. But the deep disappointment in the system leads some to seek extremer approaches."
2,"I‚Äôm prepared for it. Iv sold my house on this huge run up we‚Äôve seen in value amongst some other stocks. I‚Äôm going to be as liquid as possible when the bubble finally pops. 

Homes are being foreclosed on now. 
Unemployment running dry. 
Inflation through the roof. 

Be prepared."
2,Just figure it out. No one should be on unemployment for over a matter if the government made your place of work close
1,"While I agree those are annoying problems, it's still not my responsibility to have to pay for you. This is why you have savings or take on temporary work, of which plenty is available. This system is getting more and more convoluted and we need to throw money at every other thing to solve for an issue that throwing money at a different problem created. The government is not our daddy."
1,"Lmao,
Na, Biden probably brought em back to enforce Marshal law on us after the entire Nation revolts."
1,"Yea and have personal discipline.  Plus the term living wage.  You can ‚Äúlive‚Äù on very little just look at communist did to everyone.  

You don‚Äôt want a living wage you want a wage for doing a low skill job that lets you ‚Äúlive‚Äù the way you want."
2,Once you get out of retail and the service industry there‚Äôs a lot of good paying jobs. My dad is in charge of hiring for a construction company and he said that in the 20+ years he‚Äôs been doing it he has never hired someone for anything less than $15 an hour
1,"Exactly.  That's an effective and obvious conservative Republican policy that has popular support, and stopping it makes Democrats look like monsters.  That could've been a piece of a larger proposal, and even if it was shot down, just the idea of actually getting it done would lead to another red tide in the midterms."
2,There are 9 million jobs to fill and 7 million people losing COVID unemployment. 9-7= 2 million more jobs than people. I assume people will choose a higher paying job over a lesser one (all things being equal). Therefore for the lowest paid jobs - you are still going to have staffing issues.
2,"No I realize that‚Ä¶ it was unfortunate for many, but I also know while they milked the system till the last day the country had reopened long ago and businesses were begging people to come back. Again, 10 million jobs available and no these are not all minimum wage jobs with low hours‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶ yeah I get it some people deserved help, a lot of people also worked the system."
2,"I dunno. Sounds like my neighbor that gets drunk every day collecting unemployment while his wife works full time as a nurse. Last year he did a hit and run causing bodily injury, while drunk, and lost his license but I still see him drunk driving with his 3 kids in the car.

No one understands why his wife (she's beautiful and smart, way out of his league) doesn't divorce his sorry ass."
0,"We're not against the idea of work. We're against working in an intrinsically exploitive system. It's so strange to me that you guys always misrepresent what we believe, it's almost like we have good ideas and you *have* to invent some stupid shit to make us look bad."
2,"If you spent anytime on , then it obviously was not enough to get the idea. None of the iphone scroling, social media browsing, avocado toast eating, gender studies major members of the sub (or any other like minded people) expect the world to continue on running if everybody in the world decided it was time to retire. People are tired of the working conditions and expectations that have developed, and have finally discovered their worth as employees, People want to be able to survive and be happy without having to kill themselves working 70 hours a week. Even people working 40 expect to make a reasonable wage and be valued as employees. People want to be able to retire comfortably without having a $100k salary their whole life. People want to work to live, not live to work. None of these expectations equal no work at all, everyone knows work is necessary, and it is perfectly reasonable for some of us to complain about it. 

Sidenote: The Right has had a significant problem with understanding the meaning of phrases built out of 2-3 words."
1,"People always bitch about the 1%, but I've always maintained that it's the 10% that just won't fucking work that is the real problem in America."
1,"> Since covid and andrew yang the voices for universal basic income have multiplied in all countries not just the us of a.

The problem of course, is that the math doesn't work on UBI, and never has.  If you're a fan of science fiction, I strongly recommend the Honor Harrington series by David Weber.  It touches a bit on how that works out if you go down that route.

> People want to be able to survive and be happy without having to kill themselves working 70 hours a week. 

Then get a new job. If working 70 hrs a week is not paying for your needs, you either need to reduce your expenses or get a higher paying job. A few years ago I was making I didn‚Äôt like making that little money. I decided I wanted to make more money. I went on google and looked up high paying jobs. I found one area  that was high paying that I was relatively interested in, and I googled what qualifications I needed to get one of those jobs. For this specific job, it was a specific college degree. Now it doesn‚Äôt have to be a college degree, for some high paying jobs it could be trade school, a software coding boot camp, a certification program, etc. But for this specific job, it was a specific college degree. I then decided to go to school to get this degree. It sucked, and between school and my job I was putting in 70-90 depending on the week. I had no life whatsoever for 4 years, and like I said, it sucked. But it was totally worth it. I now work in the industry that I had originally researched. 

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the pay for your current job, you need to get a higher paying job. In order to get a higher paying job, you need to acquire a skillset that people will be willing to pay you money for. Like I said above, this doesn‚Äôt have to be school, as school can be expensive. However, there are plenty of affordable ways to attend school, and I am perfectly happy to share these with you (or anyone else) if you care, and I would love to help. Regardless, trade schools and certification programs can also be great ways to increase your skillset.

2,"Thanks for the reading suggestion.
I, too, have been skeptical about the financing method of UBI, and it's a semi absurd concept for me. Europe already has quite extensive basic income systems, but they are bound to conditions. A few countries have UBI test phases from time to time.
I think it's an interesting concept and am interested to see how it will work out.

I can somewhat relate to many if these topics, because i changed workplaces during lockdown for a job that sounded less prestigious on paper, but pay was significantly better, more time off, more benefits, less micromanagement, less pressure ""from above"". And that functions quite as well.
I understand you can't have all the benefits in every job, and sometimes you'll need minimum wage to mop up the floor or something, but everyone need to finde their niche where they can lead a fulfilling life."

Everything essential for living could be provided to an individual but work would still absolutely be required. In fact it would no longer be optional at all. when services are provided for free what incentive is there to do it? I don't know how many people would work in a warehouse for free and the same goes for teachers, doctors, surgeons. These are absolutely essential positions that now need to be assigned rather than staffed voluntarily. You can't just not pay these people.

You can advocate for a higher wages thats fine, but removing or severely reducing salary *(Which would absolutely be necessary in a gov. controlled scenario)* has dire consequences. This is why the USSR had so many problems. Magnitogorsk is a prime example. So many people died in that industrial hell hole due to the sever lack of any real experience since they just assigned random people to work in the mines & foundries. I mean imagine being told to work as an ER tech with no option to leave or find another job else where.

Agree with u again, financial worth isn‚Äôt decided by you, it‚Äôs decided by the people paying you, and companies make less money the more they pay their employees. No one should be working for an unliveable wage, and since minimum wage hasn‚Äôt exactly continued to be proportional to the cost of living, many people ARE working for less than their worth.

I will say your tbh about 40 hours not being that much absolutely decimated my original statement regarding a 40 hour week.

The real kicker is the less people work the more expensive basic goods would become. Since they need to encourage people to work who otherwise don't need too.

1,"> If i understand you correctly, the problem with 1. seem more of a social issue than economic issue.

No, its economic.  The amount Yang was talking about was $1000 per month, and Yang was talking about getting people off welfare by moving them to UBI.  Very few people can live off $12,000 per year, so they'd still need to have another source of income.  Nobody would voluntarily switch from welfare to UBI - they make far more on welfare - and if forced, they would riot.  So we're talking about UBI *in addition to* welfare.

> And with 2. has it been calculated before?

328 million people times $1000 per month is $4 trillion per year - which just happens to be about the same as our total Federal revenues.  It would leave nothing left to pay for the rest of government.  Even getting rid of welfare would just reduce the amount of programs you can't pay for.

To provide an example where a large event did cause some labor problems look at WW1. The war depopulated entire villages, but even that was due in large part to poor conscription and assignment practices. It saw around 20 million dead spread across Europe and other participating nations.

The black death also caused some labor shortages, but again it killed way more people. Estimated around 25 million.

They are unable to function at full capacity with only a skeleton crew assuming they even have enough people to open in the first place. The solution is to bump wages, but many small businesses can't afford it without also bumping prices or corporations who just don't want to."
2,"Dude there are over 10 million unfilled positions right now, and a big percentage of Covid deaths were retired."
2,Exactly I would agree it‚Äôs closer to a tax break or a tax refund. Because again you can‚Äôt live off of it. And plus the money comes from taxes paid by the oil companies because the Alaska constitution says the resources belong to the people so instead of government sending you a 55 gallon barrel of oil they send you some money
2,"I would argue that it‚Äôs better to hold real assets (eg house) during an economic crash rather than having the cash. During a crash there will be inflation, so your cash will be worth less, but a house will still have inherent value. Please share your thoughts on this because I‚Äôm not sure if this is correct."
1,Seems like an issue with business owners and not the employees. Maybe they should pay those that live hear a wage that‚Äôs livable and they won‚Äôt have to hire illegal immigrants?
2,"What, no North Korea?"
2,These are all the countries that supported them against the US for the last 20 yrs- gave them weapons etc
2,The most disturbing part of this announcement is that one of those countries is in NATO.  UGH!
2,"Fantastic.

Ensuring the next inevitable conflict with the Taliban will immediately escalate to WWIII."
2,add North Korea to the list and the enemy side of WW3 has been filled
1,"You could have stopped funding Pakistan a long time ago. You can still introduce sanctions against them. Forget reforming Shariah states, Islamism has infiltrated the American govt in the form of Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. Pakistani and Palestinian lobbyists have politicians from both sides in their pockets. Your campuses, academia,media  and the Democratic party are all cheerleaders and enablers of Islamic radicals. Things like hijab and burkha are promoted by feminists and mainstream media. Gay men support states like Palestine which would happily kill them. How do the hell can all of this be reversed by sticking to ""democratic principles"" and ""natural rights""."
2,Did we want an end to American involvement in Afghanistan or not? Trump wanted to get out of Afghanistan and while it would have been more competently handled there's no reason to believe the Taliban wouldn't hqve eventually taken over. Absent American air power the Afghan Army was always going to be useless.
1,"China the foe , will take and hold Afghanistan now, the USA has lost its geological mastery ,thanks to Biden"
1,"One wonders if the American collapse really was foolishness  , or perhaps something worse , Biden has links to China thought Hunter? its very convenient all that expensive equipment was left behind, if the though the militarily is expert at ordered withdrawals , and we all know Afghanistan is basically a huge gold mine resources wise , why is America leaving all that too enemies? Biden is bought and paid for as are the democrats"
2,Next month they'll be welcomed into the UN...
2,"Nope, they are two worried getting through the second anniversary of COVID."
2,I don‚Äôt think the Russians are stupid enough to get involved with anything to do with Afghanistan again.
2,Surprised Cuba is not one of them
0,"Best buds all in a conference. It‚Äôs crazy tho, especially China since they have Chinese Muslims in concentration camps‚Ä¶."
2,"Seriously, who cares about Afghanistan. Americans need to focus on the Americas. There are problems here that need our collective attention instead of sounding the bullhorn on anything Afghanistan. The news cycle hardly mentioned Afghanistan in the past 20 years, we should continue that and keep them off our news cycle moving forward."
1,"They're allowed on Twitter and orange man isn't, the left controls everything and it's upside down"
2,"North Korea is always the bridesmaid, never the bride"
2,There‚Äôs one country that didn‚Äôt support them that gave them weapons...
2,No one will start a world war over the Taliban
2,Funny thing is that Turkey is in NATO
2,"Good point.   
But why didn‚Äôt Obama pull out after OBL was executed ten years ago?   


Oh hell, why do birds suddenly appear 

every time 

you are near?"
2,I did. I think the focus in this tweet is how the Taliban are explicitly showing who they consider their allies.
2,"To be fair, China negotiated rights to the 3rd largest copper mine on earth (which happens to be in Afghanistan) during the Bush years. But it wasn't until recently (2021) that they got the rights to develop the newly discovered massive lithium deposits there."
1,"To be fair, the American left have supported them since about 2002."
2,"Pakistan for sure. My source? Me. I was there. Plenty of evidence Pakistan supports the Taliban. They put them in power in 1996, after all."
2,It depends where they export their terrorism to
2,Ever since that military coup. They should have to get re added to NATO.
2,"China is doing what they should be doing , creating wealth and gaining power for their nation, my problem is the globalists quislings in the west (which includes constatives AKA rhinos ),  are not opposing  behavior that might lead to China being in total control of the worlds industrial capacity  , at which point they will have us over barrel  , and will take for revenge for the ""Century of humiliation"", they have not forgotten or forgiven"
1,"Look at Chinas trade balances its awful all one way , its going cause wars if things continue like that"
2,"No will risk warefar between superpowers over a possible threat of terrorism originating in Afghanistan. Look at Syria both Russia, turkey, and the US have soldiers there and are contesting the area, Isis is still in Syria yet no war between Russia and US has broken our."
1,"I hate to say it, but they already are the leader in industry and most manufacturing. Where do you think most batteries come from? Where is a large majority of manufacturing for almost all consumer goods. The US is China's useful idiot. We consume, and therefore fill their pockets. If we aren't already over the barrel, they've at least set it out and readied the chains."
2,"Yep. It would basically be as if we had an exiled king living in NYC that was a criminal to another country (oops, we did that)."
2,"Definitely don't think nuclear war will happen. However I do have to agree with the other guy to a point. Something is going to happen. What it is no one knows for certain. All I can say is I recently stopped laughing at ""dooms day preppers"" and got me and my family  a damn good bug out bag."
1,"true but things can  always get worse , we could start diversifying imports and lessen the problem,  Trump was doing that, which is probably the  main reason ""they"" deposed him, China has way too many people in is pocket"
2,It‚Äôs just going to another chess piece on the international chessboard of geopolitics. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anywhere near as dangerous of a flashpoint of conflict as other ongoing problems across the world
0,"Oh I can almost promise it's only going to get worse. They were threatened by Trump's opposition to China, that's why he had to go at all costs. Buckle up!"
1,"its funny the amount of people that still think politics its about ideology , well it is for the political junkies and activists I gues,  but senior politicians  ..ha no, its about money and power,  , except for Trump he was the real deal . love him or lothe him"
2,There will be a lot of cool people in the gulag tho
2,"We will go where there is inequality and we will murder, steal, and oppress until we get it."
1,"I don't know where she got the idea that they wanted us in gulags.  I mean, three different Bernie staffers in different states said on video they wanted to put us in gulags if he won, and Bernie didn't fire them... but I can't imagine why anyone would think that."
1,I love how they never seem to learn from history.  This imagery is eerily similar to a Nazi propaganda poster ‚ÄúTod der L√ºge‚Äù depicting the arm of National Socalism strangling a snake.  Good to see they aren‚Äôt denying their roots.
1,"The problem is if Republicans somehow by the Grace of God get an upper hand, you won't be ruthless. You continue to want to be the good guy and allow these people to remain. This stuff needs to be stamped out. Marxists and Islamists need to be rounded up and purged from society. Their grip on media and academia needs to be loosened. You can't continue to allow these ideologies to fester because there is no middle ground with them."
1,"Woke radical millenials. They don't have jobs, live at home,  ps5 and social media until 3 am, sleep until noon, don't understand world issues /politics...but the flag looks cool, if I get it I'm cool...Pathetic."
2,"They won't be putting anyone in gulags, because they'll be dead."
2,"But we were told that equality isn‚Äôt the goal. Now it‚Äôs equity. So this flag is unjust and anyone flying it is promoting inequity in America, the most oppressive nation known to history."
1,"And its funny how if we changed a pride flag for example we would be bashed for it and ""canceled"". such hypocrits"
2,We‚Äôre gonna get crunk at the gulags.
2,"If we all go in the gulag, then that chocks up to the biggest party ever!"
2,Don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs a millennial at this point. Probably a gen z such as myself. Being left is common for people my age. The pockets of people who lean right know to keep their mouths shut in school as to not cause trouble. I made that mistake freshman year and got yelled at for hate speech against a trans student when I didn‚Äôt even know they were trans as they hadn‚Äôt looked like they changed appearance wise.
1,Fucking capitalist communists.
1,"Do these liberal/ left students really have a grasp on the issues, in the world view? Idt they understand the importance of National Border Energy independence/ security, Afghanistan, etc. Most of the younger people I know (my sons ages), either don't really care about the issues OR they follow the herd and lean left because friends, actors, musicians etc tell then that's what to be?"

2,And they supposably want to hand out another 2k to almost everyone. What good is giving away money if it's worthless because of the inevitable hyper uncrease in inflation.
1,"It's stealing from those of us with savings rather than debt, and those who are retired.  So as usual, punishing success and rewarding failure."
2,"How is this stealing from those with savings and the retired?? Seniors will be taken care of in this bill, and I understand the ultra wealthy will be a tax break.. these are good things right?"
2,"When the government spends this massive an amount of money, they are borrowing or conjuring up money in some way.  Those dollars now compete with our dollars in the market for the same goods.  Supply of money is up, demand for goods is up due to government spending, leading to of the dollars in people's savings and retirement funds.   Those in or near retirement are typically on fixed incomes or invested in less volatile, lower return assets such that they can't keep up with high inflation.  Those in the workforce and earlier in thier investing years are invested in riskier assets who's return is more likely keep up with inflation and in theory their wages rise with inflation (in theory...). In any case, every dollar you have is worth less, and every dollar you have borrowed and spent is also worth less.  Reducing your effective debt if you're in the red, but harming your savings if you are not.

The ultra wealthy primary have money in corporations whos assets and value are pretty well hedged against inflation.  It won't harm them, it'll mostly harm middle to upper-middle class."
1,"So, what is the avenue of change that limits our government from the u.s. dollar? Government spending and tax breaks for the ultra rich seems to be a problem that we have to deal with.  Spending money on needles wars that go to the military industrial complex seems to be a moot point in all this. How can we get rid of special interests stealing from normal folks? Do we not target corporate interests in how they do business in the U.S. and beyond? Shall we make folks like Bezos and Musk pay more taxes to offset this spiral?"
2,"If you took 200 billion from Bezos and just handed it out to all US citizens, it would be about $600 per person, one-time.  It wouldn't change anything drastically.  The scale of government spending is so far beyond the ultra wealthy it's obscene.  My point is the ultra wealthy are not the problem or the solution.  They're an inevitable result of a global economy in my view.  They aren't necessarily evil or good, but one thing that's pretty universal is that they have changed the world on a global scale.

The exception to the above being when special interests and lobbyists are pushing policy not in our best interest with billionaire dollars driving policy.  We used to call that corruption or at least a conflict of interest or ethics violation.

I have no idea how to fix it, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, so hold my beer:

1) Remove the power and money from DC by drastically decreasing federal spending and returning power to the states.  I'm thinking decentralization of this power makes it harder to corrupt and more accountable to the people.

2) Cryptocurrency may be a game changer.  I'm sure with its own set of unforseen consequences.


I don't know what the numbers are currently, but Biden was proposing something like 10 trillion in spending over the coming years.  For my household, of which, I'm the only income earner, if we naively just divide 10 trillion by 330 million citizens, then multiple by the number in my household, that's about 150,000 the government is spending of my earnings, on my behalf.  The reality is worse, because the bottom 50% aren't effectively paying federal income tax (though of course they pay other taxes).  I'm sorry, I have better things to spend on than supporting bloated, inefficient government.  That's only proposed new federal spending, I already pay property tax, sales tax, gas tax (presumably for 'infrastructure'), local income tax, state income tax, medicare, social security, and the corporate taxes, etc built into the good we buy.

All things considered, the bureaucrats are probably really close to controlling more of the wealth we produce than we are.  I am not against all taxes, but the way I see it the bureaucracy in DC is effectively a parasite which is bleeding us dry with debt and wasteful spending.  I don't know where all that money goes, but I'm certain obscene amounts are being wasted or even being spent on causes directly opposed to the interests of the citizens paying for this mess."

1,"Fauci was well aware that specific research into bat cornovirus was taking place at the Wuhan Virology Institute. He specifically approved funding of this type of research. Yet, early in the pandemic he pushed the line that the virus spontaneously popped up in a wet market in the same frigging city where they were studying this specific thing. 

He knew, he lied, and he may very well have been the cause of the entire massive catastrophe that COVID19 and will forever be.  It's not a stretch to make this claim. 

It is entirely possible that the man who was instrumental causing the deaths of over 4.5 million people and the loss of trillions of dollars in economic activity is in fact the same man that is being celebrated as a hero by people like Trevor Noah, John Oliver and others. In fact, there appears to be solid evidence to this.

Someone needs to ask him why he pushed the story that COVID 19 developed in nature when he was very well aware that research into that specific type of very unique virus was being funded by the NIH in the city where the virus originated."

DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO QUIETLY DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM DR FAUCI.   They need to be constantly reminded that the man they put on a pedestal is one of the main reasons we have this virus unleashed upon the world.   Every Democrat you know needs to be confronted with this."

2,"it seems after colleges and universities, they are targeting schools now. Its sad but these people are shameless."
2,I suspect a great deal is getting revealed when teachers watch their children's online classes.  The level of indoctrination occurring in these classrooms is beyond the pale.
2,"? I have all sorts of flags that I put up depending on what we are learning. Don‚Äôt tread on me‚Ä¶ Soviet Union ‚Ä¶ nazi flag‚Ä¶ Texas independence flag ‚Ä¶. 

I feel like this is half a story. What other things were in the room ? I‚Äôm guessing a US flag and all sorts of things the parente approve of. And heaven forbid the teacher have some sort of activity where the kids have to self reflect on their own beliefs. 

I‚Äôm sad to watch republicanism become the party of censorship and identifying ‚Äúwrong think‚Äù so many of us talk about the participation trophy ruining achievement (it did) but here we are. Angry cus someone doesn‚Äôt do something the way you want. 
 

I hear ‚Äúindoctrination‚Äù all the time but really What that means is people want kids indoctrinated with THEIR viewpoints. Heaven forbid a kid is introduced to Both perspectives. 
Tax paid classroom. Pls. Taxes paid for the 4 walls. The teacher paid for everything else in the damn room.

That being said - if the T really just used this as a preaching block, they can preach on the street corner. I‚Äôd have to see their curriculum and lessons to really know though."

2,"If I didn‚Äôt know better, I‚Äôd say it was almost untrue how many votes he got! Thank goodness we have the media to inform us of it!!"
2,"well ive been told  even the dead  rose from the grave, and voted for him so he must be popular"
1,"and some people liked him so much they voted 2 or 3 times , it was wonderful to see such love and affection for good old sleepy joe"
1,Ya know. Would it really surprise anyone if the Biden administration brokered a deal with the Taliban to supply replacement parts for a nominal fee.

2,There's an endless number of businesses looking for employees. People should have been getting a job long before.
1,"7 million people that sat around for a year.  Who wants to hire that lazy sack.  Millions busted their asses through the entire pandemic and made less money than the people leeching off our tax dollars.  In 9 months that will be an additional 7 million people on welfare.  With high wages, increased taxes, huge inflation on cost of goods all because of the current Marxist, authoritarian regime running this country, how many jobs will be around in a couple of months with 7 million people earning less than what they received in handouts.  Don‚Äôt forget to add rent to the equation.  The moratorium is over.  I hope I‚Äôm wrong, but I have a negative outlook on this economy."
1,"Yeah, Amazon is always hiring billions of people!  Stores are paying $20.00 an hour for unskilled labor.  How can 7 million  people be so lazy and still be able to sleep at night?"
1,"> 7 million people that sat around for a year. Who wants to hire that lazy sack. 

This is something I said early on.  If I'm a hiring manager and someone comes in looking for a job who last worked in February 2020, they had better have an explanation other than ""Unemployment paid more than working"" for why, or I won't touch them with a 10 foot pole."
1,"How could anyone hire someone that hasn‚Äôt workforce a year and a half?  I can‚Äôt imagine how demotivated an individual that literally did nothing for 18 months.  How will they wake up every morning ready to go to work?  

What I love most is the complete 180 the unions took to defend union members that do not want to take the vaccine.  The teachers union spent over a year telling the public how vaccines and masks are the key to open schools, now they want to fight against vaccine mandates.

These leftist clowns always implode on their own policies and ideology.  Defund the police , no don‚Äôt fund the police.  We need vaccines, no vaccine mandate.  1996 Biden, we need to lock up these animals, 2021 Biden, institutional racism.  Turn of the 20th century Democrats, Jim Crow laws and KKK, 1960s Democrats welfare, 2020s Democrats equity and everything is racist.  Nothing they say is true.  It‚Äôs all rhetoric.  They don‚Äôt even believe the BS they are pandering to the poor.  They are Marxist, authoritarian  and now cultural imperialist by controlling how will live, what to believe and censorship.  It‚Äôs all party first and centralize power to a federal , single party system.

They don‚Äôt want anyone to have their individual freedom or the right to pursuit happiness.  They want people on government programs.  Those in the middle get to pay for it because any bit of success is due to systemic racism."

1,"I want to push back in the idea that the Dems are outright hemorrhaging minorities.  I think it's important to qualify what's going on here with minorities starting to vote republican. 

Let's look at the 2020 election. The Trump campaign made significant investments in reaching specific minority communities eg. Tejanos in TX, American Indians in NC, and black men in general.

With the first two, the Trump campaign used messaging that spoke specifically  to those groups. Acknowledging their history, and issues specific to them. In contrast the Dems reached out to those groups as members of the ""BIPOC"" Community. The idea of BIPOC people as a group was created by the left and is defined by their ""shared oppression"". This allowed Trump to win groups which republicans never won.

Trump was able to blunt the Dem edge with black men both through his personal appeal and superior messaging. Saying, if I'm president the economy will be so good you can get rich. But again the Dems just lumped them under the BIPOC label and told them if you like trump you're not black.

In conclusion Trump was able to either blunt the Dem edge or win outright with specific minority groups by tailoring messaging for those groups and giving them an optimistic as opposed to a pessimistic message.  The takeaway is that Trump's approach is replicable and useful, but requires significant investments in crafting proper messaging and finding the right groups to target."
2,Biden recently put some visa restriction on people involved in the current genocide against the Tirgray and Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia. There's currently debate around a house resolution(H.R 445) to formally condemn Ethiopia and Eretria for genocide and crimes against humanity. Pompeo and Inhofe are lobbying on behalf of the Ethiopian and Eritrean government in opposition to Biden and most of congress.
1,"Great question. Sorry for not including information (this is something that is practically common knowledge in my circle - apologies)

See [

Also Twitter is a good metric as well [ 

Currently there is 0 coverage from MSM - in fact any coverage is anti-Ethiopia pro-interventionist (akin to Libya).

Here are some sources to why I thanked Senator Jim Inhofe & Sec. Pompeo.

* [Jim Inhofe](
* [Mike Pompeo]("
2,"The sad fact is that the narrative of ""Tigray Genocide""  has successfully reached the international audience, despite the facts on the ground.

* Cause of war was the Nov 4th attack by the TPLF (Tigray People's Liberation Front) - the ousted former ruling party of Ethiopia for over 30 years (BAD DUDES).
* Amharas have been ethnically cleansed from many areas  (Wollega, Mai Kadra, Chena, Agmasa, etc...)
* TPLF using Child Soldiers to continue their crusade in Afar & Amhara regions.

Yet TPLF has rebranded it's name (in name only) to TDF)and cries genocide while killing civilians of all ethnicities (Crocodile tears). 

In Ethiopia, there are 80+ ethnicities. Yet, TPLF (The Tigray Rebels) are literally the only faction which is actually using ethnicity as a target - yet you probably don't hear these narratives."
2,The MSM has [posted]( about the atrocities committed in Ethiopia.
1,"I haven't came across this NPR article - thanks for correcting my hyperbole.

Most outlets that reaches our circle Amnesty International, CNN, NYTimes, BBC, & The Telegraph has reported one sided stories that coverup or sympathize with the TPLF (the aggressor) by appealing to their ethnic base despite them even targeting their own who disagree.

Let me just give you a glimpse to what I'm referring to:

* NYTimes + Senator Coons makeup stories to blame the Ethiopian PM as cause.
   * [
* The Telegraph jumping through hoops to blame Ethiopians of Genocide.
   * [

There is so so so much more - if you know an Ethiopian talk to them and they'll tell you. At the moment MSM isn't reporting the facts (at best cherry picking & downplaying). I'll be doing my best to TLDR the series of events - I'm just one dude trying to clear the misinformation.

Seriously talk to an Ethiopian. Ask them about news coverage. Ask them about the Democratic Party & Biden. If what I say is a lie you'll see it reflected in their words.

Promise I'll centralize all the info. Currently, misdeeds are lost in Tweets & Local News - this shit is much deeper than they tell you."
1,I have a coworker who‚Äôs not from Ethiopia but her parents are. The way she tells it is that it started out as basically a group wanting their own freedom and then the bigger government coming in and squashing the attempts. So the little guys started taking hostages and killing civilians Vietnam style and then big government started ethnic cleansing. Basically just sounds fucked up all around.
2,"Unfortunately, you'll hear 2 stories and it's mostly divided on ethnic lines and allegiance.

If they're from Tigray (most likely but not universal) will tell you that story you shared.

Ethiopia has 80+ Ethnicities, but one political group (from Tigray) is trying to make a comeback after being ousted from power - after 30 years of being the ruling party. The TPLF is not a small guy - it's literally a political group that has used Racism to divide Ethiopia.

TPLF's aim is to make itself look like the good guy using it's operatives across the world. They are a rich & extremely corrupt group that got the boot due to a popular uprising.

Democracy has emerged; and ethno nationalism (their bread & butter) is under threat.

Imagine having the US dividing states based on ethnic lines (like This is for Whites Only, This is for Blacks Only, etc...) That's who they are... racism is a political opinion in their mind :)

Here's a joke

* Republican talks about race... they're a racist
* TPLF kills, borders & imprisons based on race... they're a fledgling democracy
* ^ That truly happened (Susan Rice & Barack Obama said that) ["

Right, because that's remotely in the same ballpark. Biden got these people killed, then couldn't be bothered to show an ounce of decorum for the 45 minute ceremony. He then went on to roll his eyes at the mother of one of the dead marines, among other things, and wouldn't shut up about his own son."

The initial critique was a still image, which in sure you'll agree are extremely easily taken out of context... honestly I'm my opinion you and I and every American got those soldiers killed, along with the thousands of other US soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Afghan soldiers that have died over the last two decades for supporting this war not just in the first place but along the way.  There was *never* going to be a clean pull out no matter who was in office. Period. 

The difference here is that Sundowning Irish Joe (or likely the people around him) saw that he doesn't seem to care or realize there's an election coming up so they ended it."
1,"Your argument re: Babbitt would be correct, IF she had actually crossed through the doorway - she had not, he shot her THROUGH the doorway and she fell on the other side of the door because she had not crossed through at that point

Home owners have been prosecuted for shooting through the doorway at someone attempting to crash through their door - there is fear, but insufficient fear of imminent death or great bodily harm as long as the aggressor is on the OTHER side of the door (like Babbitt)"

1,"The Dumbocrats don't care about ANYONE except themselves - sure, it's virtue signaling for political brownie points - doesn't make it any less vile"
2,"> If you're not an American, frankly, I don't give a damn. 

Maybe you forgot that it wasn't only American troops fighting in Afghanistan. Coalition forces had soldiers from many other nations. For example the British had close to 500 dead, the Italians 100ish, etc etc (and many more were wounded and will most likely suffer the consequences of that for the rest of their lives). You're spitting on their graves with that statement. Have a modicum of empathy, for fuck's sake."
2,"I sense hostility. No need for that.

We need to clear a couple of things: first, this is not about the war in Afghanistan as a whole. Second, this is not about drawing comparisons between Biden and the last three presidents, it's about this one particular instance.

I understand why my opinion may not matter to you, because this is your country, not mine. And I respect that. I have always respected Americans for their patriotism.

It's also absolutely fine to discuss different opinions. Mine, for instance, is that an American president should be more mindful of his behavior. Yours may be different.

Let's come together, and in words of Joe Biden during his inauguration speech, ""We can treat each other with dignity and respect""."
2,"Yeah,  because it's not like there were blockades and checkpoints preventing Americans from leaving right?"
2,Another thing I forgot to add. Shooting through a closed door isn‚Äôt the same as a police officer defending congressmen as they evacuate the building.

So you both want to dismiss the image for having no context, then whine about someone introducing additional context? That's... an interesting take.

I‚Äôm not going to pretend I have any knowledge whatsoever about case law or anything castle doctrine. I‚Äôm just a guy on Reddit.

2,"This is a statement from Chief of Police following that day 

‚ÄúAs protesters were forcing their way toward the House Chamber where Members of Congress were sheltering in place, a sworn USCP employee discharged their service weapon, striking an adult female.  Medical assistance was rendered immediately, and the female was transported to the hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries.  She has been identified as Ashli Babbitt.‚Äù"
2,Yeah I do know about the AOC thing. But I‚Äôm under the impression that there were a few reps In the ‚Äúgallery of House of Representatives‚Äù is that not in the same building?
2,"This isn't castle doctrine related - the only issue in situation like this is whether the cop had a legitimate fear for IMMINENT death or great bodily harm - in the process or climbing through a window isn't there yet - imminence doesn't accrue until the person is on your side of the door and in a position to cause imminent harm

Officer was ""cleared"" of the shooting by the Capitol Hill police - of course he was

That's like the Chicago Police having initially cleared the dumbass who illegally shot that Laquan McDonald buffoon"
0,What threat did an unarmed woman pose to an armed secret service officer. He could have fired a warning shot or he could have moved to arrest her when she came through the window. There was also a swat team at babits rear coming up the stairs which I imagine had contact via radio with the shooter. You can see them signal eachother with a thumbs up after the shot

2,"It also does not help that clean, cheap, easy-to-refuel reactors could have been a thing back in the '40s and '50s but were not because Admiral Hyman Rickover didn't want anything nuclear that did NOT generate plutonium.

Several great reactor designs that cannot melt down were created. In the event of failure, they shut the reaction off. Most of them ran on thorium salts and not uranium. Therefore, no plutonium.

That made the Admiral unhappy because no plutonium = no big booms."

The worst part is, the side who's wrong will believe 100% that they are right. So there's no way to truly know who is right and who is wrong."
2,"Oh you mean like by forcing small businesses around the country to close down permanently, killing competition and crushing the economy, causing crime, homelessness, suicide, preventable disease and third-world starvation to skyrocket?"
2,"Yes I agree, and I don't like it.

That being said, it's been far easier for me as a nuclear advocate to convince a right winger to support nuclear power than to have a left winger support nuclear.

The left bludgeoned the right with emotional appeal and NIMBYism to shut down our stance on nuclear in the general public, meaning that the only options left if you knew solar and wind wouldn't do anything would be to either be silent and keep voting... Or throw your hands in the air. It's so easy to bring right wing republicans who don't believe in climate change back to believing in reasonable stances on environmentalism as long as A) it's incremental and B) you validate their concerns. Same thing I've done with most topics.

And, to be honest, if the right says don't spend money and not solve the problem, and the left says spend more money on something that won't solve the problem... I think not spending money is still a better option.

It's so irritating if you look at it and see how the the nuclear regulatory commission called a lot of the anti nuclear attacks ""leftist trash"" all the way back in the 80s. If they let us keep going we would have been like France and this wouldn't have been an issue."
2,"As a hard left winger, yeah yeah I know, not supposed to post, I actually agree with your stance on nuclear and also support nuclear power. I really think the energy generation stuff is a problem on both sides... with dumb republicans talking about bringing back coal as a major energy source, and dumb people on my side shutting down ideas like nuclear as efficient ways of generating clean energy.

The problem with don't spend money and don't solve the problem is no steps are being made towards solving the problem. Not saying spending money is great, but it can at least create progress to a solution if well managed.

Now whether you think the left can manage it well is of course a valid concern... I also believe government is wasteful and stupid in many situations after all."
2,"To be fair, I‚Äôm somewhat left leaning and super into nuclear.  It‚Äôs not a lost cause.  I actually find a lot of the older more conservative men who don‚Äôt know much about nuclear are the ones still quite nervous about it!"
2,"Hey man, in this polarized time I'm happy to find common ground. One of my best friends since I moved to GA is a traditional auth left guy, and when we have to talk politics that's our common ground we loop back to.

It is true both sides have their derps, we just need to reel them in. I remember being 'shut down' by someone on the left calling me a climate change denier because I said renewables can't fill our energy needs.

And I get that nothing is being done if you do nothing... But sometimes if you're given two shitty options I'd rather we do the least shitty one. 

As an example, let's say we told two people to each pick up a cinder block and carry it 100m east. If one person is fiddling with the block and then walking 30m south, and the other is kind of sitting there... That would mean the person sitting there is putting us in a better position.  That's how I view it; if we spend ungodly sums of money in renewable tech that won't solve the problem were essentially wasting money. Don't get me wrong, I think the gov should be, in general, supporting tech advancements... But we need to prioritize. If we took half the renewable funds and gave it to the scientists and engineers trying to make  nuclear stations cheaper or faster to construct, it would have actually made a dent.

Cheers to finding common ground, from a right winger to a left winger!"
1,"Not to keep pointing fingers back and forth, but the resistance to nuclear power really is a primarily left-wing phenomenon in politics. The sooner we all get behind it though, the better!"
2,I could see why. Nuclear is a clean and reliable power source but accidents do happen
2,"Yep, you guys just also have to work on your older conservative ally‚Äôs that really only have poor knowledge of the (mostly man made) disasters of the past.  People like me will work the left. 
Most libs I know are in favour of a *diverse* energy economy.  More wind, yes. More solar, yes. Nuclear additions, yes. nationally refined oil products, yes.  Not everyone left wing is ultra progressive, just like not everyone right wing is alt-right extreme. There‚Äôs a middle ground somewhere with a lot of overlap on these issues."
2,"In the documentaries I‚Äôve watched, the ‚Äòmajor‚Äô accidents have been due to negligence.   I‚Äôm definitely open to links citing otherwise, however, it‚Äôs my understanding that Chernobyl for example was a direct result of plant management ignoring power source protocols and straight up causing an avoidable disaster (trying to cover it up obviously didn‚Äôt help) and 3 mile island for another example, was the result of a leak that was not registered by any sort of sensor or properly maintained and was an entirely avoidable incident in itself as well.  Sadly, communication technology wasn‚Äôt at the level it has been at for the last couple decades to lead to faster, more experienced troubleshooting either.  Both examples are tragic and damaging to the psyche, but, when studied, the argument of how dangerous they are lessens as the argument for human error grows."
2,"Exactly. I was literally just watching a Chernobyl technical documentary last night and it explained what happened and why. The engineers allowed the nuclear reactor to enter an unstable state without realizing what had happened, and then had pulled too many control rods out causing the reactor to overheat and explode"

2,"Nah, this is just another grift. The same people who gave him millions to ‚Äúfight‚Äù the bogus election fraud claims will give him more millions to hold bizarre rallies across the nation. He will sound more and more like Hitler with Alzheimer‚Äôs. 

What do y‚Äôall think will happen to the post-Trump GOP?  Will you still worship reality TV stars who only want to grift, or find someone with an actual conservative platform and a shred of character?"
0,"The link is vital to understanding the nuances and strategy involved with an announcement at this time.

But yah, this guy is right, Trump will be the death of the Republican party if the party doesn't cut bait."

INCOMPETENCE on a breathtaking scale. Perhaps our worst foreign policy debacle ever. And to further exhibit his senility, Biden now excitedly CONGRATULATES himself about Afghanistan---how's THAT for irony? üôÑüòÅ"
2,"Ah, so, when will this misinformation be taken down? The FBI has already made a ruling on this."
2,"Also, MSNBC can freely show the video of the gun being fired and killing someone, and YT doesnt take it down, while if anyone else who isnt a large news network showed such a clip, it gets removed for violating YT's guidelines.

I can only assume that this is because A) they are MSNBC, thus they are held to different standards and rules, and B) YT actually agrees with the political message and tone, thus they allow MSNBC's coverage to run unchecked.

And this is why people hate you and want to cause violence."
2,"I love the completely "" _unbiased take_ "" of MSNBC.
This is absolute gold anyway, I wish they had succeeded. You know, buildings can actually be burned and be brought into the ground, just saying...."
1,"So bad that people were stuck inside their homes that were set on fire by people? So bad that business buildings burned? So bad that historic statues were damaged? Buildings, cars and more were vandalized? People by themselves were beaten in the streets? Nah. At least on Jan 6, the people peacefully appeared, to the location of the source of our problems. I do not support violence, vandalism or any of that, but It was Antifa and BLM that screwed it up again in this case. Made it look bad for the innocent. Not regular ordinary citizens defending their rights. Enough of Jan 6, Solve 2020 Riots first!

Dig up strength from deep within yourselves. These radical leftists and anti Americans (who have fallen victim to the media) will never get the best of us or our country. If anyone doesn't like it here then they can move out of the USA. PERIOD. As we already know history repeats itself.  We have already won this same war many times over. Now we just gotta do it again.

0,Trump needs to go to prison for everything he has done. He keeps getting away with things that anybody else would be charged.  He is not a nice person on so many levels. I watched the video of more footage of the riot and I'm still in shock with what I saw. This riot was way worse than I thought
2,FBI says different.

1,Americans need to remember that these news agencies love to claim things that did not happen to make the rioters look even worse. Especially MSNBC.

Americans are being killed by the cartels coming into our country with tons of drugs and creating crime nation wide. He is not competent to hold the office. He did not win the election. He has caused more destruction to our country faster than any President  that has ever served. We must remove him asap to give our country a fighting chance to save our country. Please contact  our goverment and let your voice be heard. The phone numbers you can call at the capitol to let your voice be heard is 202-224-3121   202-225-3121. These numbers will connect you with capitol switch board where you can ask to speak with the office of your state politicians. Please get Biden out now before we all pay dearly.

They won't listen to blacks of any stripe; they won't listen to Hispanics. They won't listen to women, or Libs, or Progressives, or children, or ANYONE who insists that the idea of God has to pass even the most feeble standards of discussion, or science, or even education. And why do they hyperventilate so? Because THEIR idea of what God is, can't pass even those abbreviated tests.

ROTpublicans proudly stand for ALL the rest of us, those groups I detailed above, just pulling in our unruly noses, and letting them ride roughshod over us and our priorities.

And since ROTpublicans HAVE NO MORALS to speak of, they are not willing to just go home when they DON'T HAVE THE MAJORITY. No, they've got to then STEAL the votes, by screwing up the entire voting system... and KEEPING it screwed up in a ROTpublican direction.

Our task now is to stop that from happening. Period."

Such a cute-worded description as, ""grumpy old party"" to describe the right is like saying,. ""Yeah, they've done some bad things,  but, they meant well.""  Already there is a great problem with Republican's blatantly, shamelessly lying  and denying, plus refusing  to acknowledge the damage they have done, all to please Donald J. Trump. Please don't use endearing words to describe any of them until we know the depth of their involvement . They are a terrorist gang now, with crimes against America too numerous to mention. Many right-wing politicians became traitors on the day insurrectionists impersonated patriots as they violated America. And now for some bizarro reason-they defy helping America end the pandemic. They are willing to even put their own children's lives at stake to ""own the libs""  they say. That's not even the American thing to do.  Who are these people who think they are patriots and why don't they realize they are acting more like bullies or terrorists themselves?"

Trump is not a republican; he is his own entity. 
And he is causing an acceleration of change in the republican party, which I'm happy about. 
The democrats are fooling themselves if they think there are no racists in their party.

1,"A key aspect to a happy world is harmony. Harmony consists everybody. Harmony is influential. Happiness is influential. Those two things don't exist in the overall human race because of a lot of set backs. One key thing that divides the human race is the difference in ethics. Good ethics or morals are principles that contribute to Good conduct and good conduct is a positive influence that contribute to harmony. Good ethics should be universal around the earth just like a smile generally means happiness around earth.

Here's the thing. Besides all the crime and misery that contribute to this sick world that has it's negative influence, you also have loose morals (let's say loose conduct for better understanding) and loose conduct has it's negative influence. Example, parents that regularly curse around their kids might influence their kids even if they tell them not to do it. Homosexuality, is, loose, conduct. It has it's influence as you can clearly see around you in today's world. It, contributes, negatively, to, humanity. How?

Homosexuality challenges the importance of ethics, logic and reasoning. Three common things you need for wisdom and Three common things that are challenged in committing crimes like murder, domestic violence, rape etc.. When you challenge those things in regards to the ethics of sexuality, it attacks the meaning of ethics in general and attacks the human cognition like, 'if I could do this I could do even more' which could lead to recklessness. It also attacks the meaning on quality of life, like how a person experiences life. Influence effects your motivations and your mental and physical wellbeing, and it's contagious because it effects you and everyone else.

So how is homosexuality truly beneficial to those doing it and to humanity? The world is like a family household, if one thing is out of place, everything is. So we all have a part on contributing to earth and humanity, it's best to be in harmony not disarray. But this world won't be in harmony with loose conduct, that's one key reason why the world is the way it is today.

NO ONE is born Gay. There is no scientific proof that people are born Gay. There is ZERO proof. ZERO! There is not a ""Gay Gene."" This is a fairy tale. People believe deceptive lies. They say, ""Gays were born that way."" That's just as ignorant as saying, ""Child Molesters were born that way."" Or ""Thieves were born that way."" Or ""Adulterers were born that way."" HOW STUPID! WHAT A GREAT BIG LIE! NO! People are NOT born Gay. People are born with a CHOICE! People are not ""born that way."" People are born with a CHOICE! LIFE IS A CHOICE! People are born with a CHOICE! People CHOOSE right or wrong. People choose to live for God or for themselves. They CHOOSE to walk in darkness or walk in light. And people will be judged by God for the choices they make. NO! People are NOT born Gay. People are born with a CHOICE!

God's Word is perfectly clear. It says Gay, Homosexuality and Lesbianism is wrong. Gays, Homosexuals and Lesbians will not go to Heaven...they will go to Hell! [1 Cor.6:9,10]. The the sexually immoral... their place will be in the fiery Lake of Burning Sulfur."" [Rev.21:8]. God's Word calls homosexuality ""degrading of the body, shameful, indecent and perversion.""

A choice to live for themselves and their selfishness or to live for God. ""Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve."" [Josh.24:15]. People are born with a CHOICE!

You owe it to your American family members that fell at places like Gettysburg, Normandy and Iwo Jima. ¬†You owe it to your current American family and to family members not yet born and whom you will never see but most importantly, you owe it to yourself.

You are now facing the strongest opponent to American freedom that America has ever known and the odds of survival seem long. ¬†How did we succeed in the past against tyranny, oppression and assault?¬†

Some might say that we sent our former family members into battle with the best technology and resources available and they would be partly right. ¬†But our true strength has always resided in our steadfast faith in God. ¬†Our belief that our cause was just and that it was by God‚Äôs hand that we would prevail. ¬†

Let us renew that trust and faith and accept the promise of help in dark times. ¬† Let us unleash the greatest power in creation and call upon our creator to help us in the shadow of what seems to be the death of our Republic. ¬†One nation under God and in God we trust is the cornerstone of this nation.¬†

And so on Wednesday, July 8th let all God loving members of the American family and across the globe unite in prayer that first begins by acknowledging that without Jesus Christ we can do nothing and with Jesus Christ all things are possible for His glory. That in our own words we ask for guidance and direction to do our part in restoring the founding principals of this nation. ¬†And if inclined to do so, share those prayers with others by posting on YouTube. ¬† (Please share this message)"

Now, he hails gay marriage. What a fucking hypocrite asshole we have as president. No wonder Democrats try to gain gay votes by passing gay mariage through their liberal contacts at the Supreme Court."

To know I live amongst such evil, homophobic people is utterly frightening and disgusting, it's no surprise to see scripture being quoted and the rather banal, supercilious ""i'm holier than thou"" attitudes. Honestly, whatever cult you subscribe to, your god or cow, whichever you prefer, can go fuck itself. The book you abide by is nothing more than primitive scare tactics. How pathetic that in the era of information we're still falling pray to poorly written, out-dated, evidence lacking, illliterature. This is why the U.S. gets so much flak, because we're a broken nation and the root of it is religion i.e, lack of reason, sheer stubbornness. Put down the gosh darn books and put your morality on the front line and ask yourselves aside from your ignorant ideologies, why you feel entitled to spout your bullshit on the gay and lesbian community as if it holds any weight? You people are too far gone for even Asclepius to heal... I feel as stupid as those I speak of for even entertaining their asinine beliefs. Hail to equality and may the U.S. continue to break down these barriers."

2,"The Supreme Court consists of nine justices, each one was UN-ELECTED by the people and serve life time tenures. Let me check my memory and I see there was another government entity in the last millennium ¬†that was also UN-ELECTED and served for their entire life, that‚Äôs right, a KING. History tells us what our founding fathers thought of such a government entity when they gave King George V a big ‚ÄúF ¬†you‚Äù when they signed the Declaration of Independence. Today we have ¬†a Supreme Court that is governing just like a king, using judicial decrees to make law, a form of judicial activism that has no legitimate place in the highest court of the land. If the Supreme Court wants to become a political entity of our three branches of government, of which in my opinion they have firmly established with their recent rulings, then they should be subject to the same process as the other two branches, the legislative and executive, and that is an ELECTION. No longer should Supreme Court justices be nominated by the president and then approved by the senate. These justices should be elected by the people through a national election, like any other political entity in a DEMOCRACY."

Jesus said sexual immorality, which includes Homosexuality, make a person ""unclean, defiled and polluted!"" God's Word says, ""Keep the marriage bed undefiled, uncontaminated, unsoiled, for God will judge the sexual immoral."" [Heb.13:4]. God will judge the Sexually Immoral and all sex outside of the marriage bed. The marriage bed is to be uncontaminated."

I deserved a smack really, but I absolutely know that if I‚Äôd been less well educated I‚Äôd have signed the statement and ended up in trouble, and can‚Äôt imagine what kind of hell I‚Äôd have landed in had I been anything other that white & middle class.

Looked up this guy. He is currently a fugitive from justice because it tried to interfere with a trial in Washington state by acting as the defendents attorney despite not having a law license.  He and his wife have fled to Mexico where our ambassador says he is behaving like a spoiled brat because he picks and chooses what laws of theirs he will obey. He insists their cops speak to him in English, he won't observe their Covid19 rules because he doesn't believe in Covid19. Oh yeah he believes in conspiracy theories and is a Libertarian."

I followed a speeding canine unit concerned that it was driving erratically and posing a  danger to other motorists without any lights blaring, and he finally pulled over. A young cop emerged and looked at my ID and asked me why i was following him. I said, ""you were going 100 and cutting people off with no lights."" I also said, ""You are the worst driver i've ever seen."" He let me go and as far as i could see he drove more carefully after that."
0,This was a great video. I like how this gentleman questioned the officer with a very strong knowledge of the use of unmarked vehicles. This is actually how a actual cop should approach a vehicle. They should walk up and say ‚Äúdo you know why I pulled you over‚Äù without drawn gun. Then they explain why. This doesn‚Äôt happen in the videos I have seen with violence. The cops assume you are a criminal and don‚Äôt tell the person what they have or may have done. It‚Äôs your a criminal and I am judging you.
2,This law was passed in 1990 so why have the officers never been taught nor charged with any kind off offence as it happens a lot!
2,0:42 Why do f always try to socialize. I‚Äôm a liberal. I don‚Äôt want to hear about your fake sky daddy. Seriously if you‚Äôre a Christian please go get shot in an illegal war or something

2,"There are church goers who might have thoughts towards the way people live their lives, but they keep it to themselves. They understand, their feelings are a matter for God to judge them on. Then there are bible basher's who go out of their way to judge people openly on things like dress sense. Logan is the bible basher. If someone like him approaches you, just sit there and ignore him. Keep chatting to those you went to the venue with, or if you are alone & have a radio, turn it on & drown them out. (Make sure you only take a cheap radio to the beach.

2,If the creator of life and master of the universe wanted us to follow a set of rules or guidelines on how we should live our lives then why speak in parables that only cause confusion and are subject to each person‚Äôs interpretation of what those words mean?

I know adulting is hard, but if you want freedom, you have to learn to be responsible....jeez"
2,So young girls in bikinis üëô üëô at the beach triggered your porn addiction. So to satisfy your self-serving perversion you approached these young women under the guise of Christ. Then because your fiance had on that wack a$$ Wonder Woman outfit you're mad? Allegedly! The only difference between them and his fiance is her bottoms. But she is showing her skins none the less.

2,"I'd have told him that God created Adam and Eve naked and the beach provides us with an opportunity to get closer to our original state in Paradise. This guys previous job in his previous life was handing out fig leaf's in the Garden of Eden. I'd have called up a photo on my phone of Michaelangelo's Sistine Chapel frescoes as soon as he invoked the name of God. For devout Michaelangelo, the purest expression of divinity is found in the perfection of the naked human form. Unfortunately, the leaders of the Catholic Church were even more uptight about nudity than this guy: they commissioned other artists to paint clothes over the original figures nudity."
2,"When I was a kid some gigantically fat, gross woman told me I had to leave a public pool because I was upsetting young children because of my leg (I am an amputee). She even put her hands on me to physically force me to leave the pool area, at which point the life guards (and letter the police) got involved. 
     Never mind that I had every right to use the pool and had paid to be there.
     Also, I have been an amputee for 48 years now (since I was 3) and yea, little kids are sometimes scared, but mostly they are curious. If I can talk to them (always with parents permission) they stop being scared right away.
     When I worked at a resort I was swimming laps on my day off when I saw a little girl, about 4 with my fake leg trying to give it to her terrified looking dad.
    The kid was German and was trying to tell her dad, ""Daddy, someone for got their leg. You need to find them and give it back before they fall over.""
    Dad was thinking, ""Oh god, my kid has found someone's prosthetic leg and is playing with it. What should I say if the owner sees this?""
    Well his nightmare had come true. The owner had seen it, but thought it was hella funny.
    Though the child spoke only German, and I spoke only English the father, once he realized I was not upset was happy to translate.
     I was able to tell the child about my leg through her father. The kid was extremely sweet. After I explained about my leg and got her to put it back, she said something and patted my head (I was in the pool at this point) that caused her dad to laugh. She had said, ""You poor man. Not only is your leg gone, you can't even talk.""
     I have a huge amount of experience with children. It doesn't hurt them to see disabled people."
2,I spoke to fast...I WAS RIGHT ABOUT HIM and why he had a issue with these women. lol

2,So glad these girls were atheists. Smart
0,I thought the girls were really sweet in the way they handled being accosted like that.  Laughing and asking politely to be left alone. There were several guys in the background without shirts on.  These religious fools were just ridiculous.

But each one dropped their stone & walked away. I would like to see if other women down the beach, were dressed the same way as the girls, and if he reacted to same way to them."
1,he was not saying all for ivermectin   he was talking about his entire treatment  it got him better     TYT  spreads misinformation by saying Trump was working with putin for four years
1,The vaccine doesn‚Äôt work you can catch it and past it.. let this shit run its course.
1,"he never claimed that ivermectin is the ONLY thing that cured him......   the bottom line is, it wasn't the vaccine that cured him, obviously.......   TYT and CNN accusing someone from spreading misinformation is the MOUNT EVEREST of irony :D:D:D"
2,Segura in the interview tells joe that  he got the vaccine because his cousin who is infectious diseases expert admitted to him is the best choice then rogan does a stink face.
2,he would sue tyt but they have no money.
2,He was talking about suing CNN because they were saying he was taking the drug used on horse's not the one prescripted to humans.
2,"Dr Andrew Hill's post may have been referring to a ""study"" published by the Front Line Medical Care Alliance. Earlier this week, a judge prevented Dr Wagshul, the guy who runs that shit-show, from prescribing Ivermectin to a Covid patient."
2,Ana is triggered that Joe never invites her or any of the tyt clowns on his podcast. Big suprise nobody likes moronic SJWs
2,"He's making a questionable cause lagical fallacy, he is using correlation and implying causation, when some people don't even get symptoms from the virus that's some fairly sloppy thinking."
1,"Please don‚Äôt wear masks, please don‚Äôt take the vaccination, please take animal medicine and anything else you want. THANOS."
0,Ivermectin is perfect for Republicans. It is an anti-parasitic.
2,Joe Organ sure took a lot of drugs for a disease that ‚Äúisn‚Äôt that harmful‚Äù
0,"I think it would be helpful if we had a list of drugs that are actually being used by medical professionals to treat covid-19 patients and drugs that charlatans are pushing as treatments for covid-19. Education on this is important, otherwise grifters will continue to grift those who are gullible"
0,"To answer why people will pay for medicine that isn't proven to work instead of taking the vaccine for free is because there is a saying.  ""A fool and their money will soon part"""
1,I'm unsubscribing from tyt due to finally seeing that they will spew left wing talking points blinding .. do your own research about ivermectin.. just to add I'm all for democratic progression
2,I used being vaccinated. That and garlic. Hmm... it looks like I am fine without Ivermectin. Joe Rogan is just some punk who got lucky and survived. Wait until next strain. We will see if he survives that round.
1,Ana is better then Joe. Much better. Joe is garbage.
2,why don't everybody have access to monoclonal antibodies? What's the reason? Are there people who are more important than others?
2,Joe Rogan living proof that comedians are not philosophers and you don't have to be smart to be funny
2,I have watched this pandemic since in began and doctors have said how it tricks people because they naturally get better for a couple of days and then they go down hill fast.......Has Rogan been 'well' for sometime now or only a couple of days?
2,"Please Ana, by all means go talk to him on his show line Cenk did. Engage in a healthy disagreement that may educate how both sides think about it. You debated Tomi Lahren. Why not just be a guest? Not a bad idea for some attention to both points of view."
2,"I listened to a couple episodes of Joe Rogan's podcast a couple months ago while at work. Wanted to see what all the hype around this guy was. I really only knew him from the sitcom ""Newsradio"" and ""Fear Factor"", time killers on NBC back in the day. So I listened, and his interviews where serviceable, and he had no great insight into anything with his commentary. Like most of his show was pleasant enough background, but the level his listeners think he's so smart and the $100 million dollar is baffling. Like he wasn't even a good entertainer really. Like Rush Limbaugh was a horrible man, but his show could be entertaining, and he was a brilliant broadcaster, if not a great commentator who would often say horrific things. However he could stretch nothing into hours of content. Rogan doesn't even have that going for him. So, basically, I don't get this guy at all. However, on a larger scale, he has gotten dangerous and Spotify needs to pull his contract."
1,Joe is endlessly disappointing and really chosen to go down the path of the rightwing grifter in order to make even more money than he already has...
2,Was he vaccinated
2,"Either way he got better WITHOUT THE VACCINE !!!............And weren't they telling people that antibiotics just don't work at all in the beginning ??? So, there's no need in even thinking about taking'em.... They were suppressing and bad mouthing  just about everything(even vitamins ) last year that was Not a wearing a mask or waiting for vaccine ...."
2,You guys all thought that Joe would die and were rooting for it because it would fit your narrative of ‚Äúvaccines for everyone‚Äù. You were wrong. Vaccines are only for those with comorbidities. He got over this virus in ONE day with no vaccine. Lol.
2,Rogan is such an impressionable baby. At this point it seems malicious or it's because he is self-selecting the only doctors who agree with this Ivermectin BS. Data is out there. Read it or shut up
1,"Look up, ""EXPOSED! FDA, CDC WHO is hiding this from you."""
0,"Joe Rogan has got many deaths on his hands. What's he going to do now, sue for ""defamation""? :-)"
2,"His doctor advised him to take it you nimwats, crazy how TYT's content is aligned with CNN's, MSNBC etc, watch the video his doctor advised him, it helped him. he never told people to take it"
2,"I think the other point is, he is constantly claiming that people like him with no comorbidities  and are healthy are fine. 

So why does he need intervention?  It‚Äôs just a cold isn‚Äôt it? 

He accidentally shown that deep, deep down, he doesn‚Äôt believe it."
2,"I mean people can try to use  Ivermectin for covid. And if it doesn't work, they can curse joe rogan on their deathbed lol"
2,Guess ana and cenk won't be on his show anytime soon
2,"Z pac, the antibiotic, will do absolutely nothing against a virus. 
REAL doctor‚Äôs are actually strongly against prescribing antibiotics for anything other than a bacterial infection, because it can cause antibiotic resistance when used when it‚Äôs not needed. 
Yeah, way to go Joe, treat a viral infection with an antibiotic. 
Idiot. üòµ‚Äçüí´"
1,tYt is the most stupid online political content creator rip tyt
0,If there is a virus in the future that is a 100% death rate we are screwed even with a vaccine because people will still be stupid.
1,"Simple !!!! They don't trust the government or TYT, CNN & all the usual propaganda suspects. Maybe because they have all lied about so much all ready !!!"
2,"I have been calling out Kulinski and Talking Points for not calling out ""their boy"". I just saw Saagar back the fool up! ""F**k MSM!""? If they won't call Rogan out, who will?! ""Duh, Duh, it was a duh"". I used to give Kulinski some creditability but the ""synergy"" between him and Talking 'Pints' idiocy has me wondering."
2,"The real problem with Ivermectin is that it only cost about 2 cents a pill‚Ä¶
along with vitamin D (study after study has shown the lower your vitamin D status the harder this virus hits you) there is simply no money to be made.
Shame on you TYT for not doing your job as journalists and buying into the world of big pharma
the WHO says Ivermectin is one of the safest drugs on the planet and could easily be given out to people waiting for a vaccine‚Ä¶the problem is tho if you give people cheap drugs and they get the virus and don't get that sick, they might feel like they don‚Äôt need the vaccine‚Ä¶only money to lose if you promote something cheap, even if it ‚Äúhelps‚Äù
You say that there are no studies‚Ä¶let me ask you this, if you were sick how ethical would it be to withhold a medication that might save your life? Would you participate in such a study?

"
2,"WHERE WILL YOU GO WHEN YOU DIE? 

What day will it happen? Today? Tomorrow? 

One hundred and fifty thousand people die every day. How many of them were ready?

When you stand before God on that day will you go to heaven or hell? 

Jesus Christ tells us that unless you‚Äôre born again you will not see the kingdom of God. You will be judged for your sins; all of the lies, the immoral thoughts, stealing, blaspheming and justly sentenced to hell.

But you don‚Äôt have to go to hell. Jesus Christ tells us that whosoever repents of their sins and trusts in him can be saved. Jesus paid the penalty of your sins on the cross at Calvary two thousands years ago. 

What sin is worth an eternity in hell? Think how precious your eyes are to you, what would it take to sell your eyes? And how much for valuable the soul that looks out of those eyes? Don‚Äôt go to hell, repent and trust in Jesus and be saved."
2,"Z-pac is some dangerous s***! Doctors don't clue you in on this, wipes out your body's microbiome, causes liver damage, way too strong of an antibiotic!"
0,"I called this. I knew Rogan would fail to mention that he also received Regeneron's monoclonal antibodies treatment which is between $1200 and $1500 per shot, Z-pack antibiotics, a vitamin drip, and still hasn't answered whether he's gotten vaccinated. Seems Mr anti-media propaganda, is himself a propagandist. F**k Joe Rogan."
2,Why do people not listen to scientists and consensus? Does Joe even bring reputable doctors on his show anymore?
0,"Know what‚Äôs super ironic? The same people who refuse the vaccine because they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in it or understand how it works are scared of the side effects are the same people who gladly seek out and take ivermectin without any clue how it works, what is in it, or what the side effects and possible risks are ü§£ AND they‚Äôll cite the study that has since been retracted due to medical fraud as the holy grail of reasons to take ivermectin, yet purposely ignore alllllllll the actual legitimate data proving the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Takes a special kind of stupid. And the sad (and scary!) part is our world is full of em‚Ä¶"
0,"Have we been watching the same Joe Rogan? I have no idea how anyone could have ever thought that he had more than perhaps an eighth of a brain. He has never asked an intelligent question on his show. He just asks his stupid questions in an engaging way, and makes it painfully obvious that he doesn't understand why his controversial guests are controversial. Then his smart guests are just good at taking his stupid questions and giving interesting responses, anyway. He has ALWAYS been the Donald Trump of interviews. He just leverages his confidence and name recognition to convince unknowledgeable people that he is competent and get them to follow him through a kind of unfounded hero worship."
2,"For all of you who wished a person like Rogan and Trump a speedy recovery, I sure hope you‚Äôre all happy. üòêü§®"
2,"I don‚Äôt know ,  should I believe Anna or doctor Pierre Kory (a well known critical care physician ) who with his team treated  hundreds or even thousands covid patients using ivermectin and other medications ."
2,Joe Rogan is a moron. It‚Äôs scary how many followers he has when the guy can barely have a coherent thought. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2,"It's not intelligence thats in play here. First, JR has always been into anti gov conspiracy, and second It's about the attention grabbing. He has became another ""professional idiot"" making whatever statements that will bring in the $. His show should come with disclaimer."
2,Joe Rogan suppose expert saw a way to make money on covid so he decided to go that way and Rogan talk about big pharma reasons. He got lied to and he does not even know it.
2,Take care TYT !! Jo is suing CNN & only right. TYT next !!!
2,I'm sure it was the horse meds and not all the other shit he took that was actually proper meds for covid. lol
2,I would of been a little more on board with the ivermectin claim until he mentioned the doctor who prescribed it. I forget the name of the group the doctor is part of I think it's Frontline c19 doctors or some crap but the get major kick backs. Doctors can be bad people too.
2,If you listened to his podcast you might have heard him say he already had his medical treatment in place if he caught covid. That wasn't panicking. As for the vaccine it is not a cure all. Evidence now points to it offsetting the worst effects of covid but you will need a booster 6 months after your second vaccination given it is now proven that it's efficacy drops to 40% after that initial period
2,Lol why you piss off at him for his own opinion. His body his choice . Not like your beloved vaccine does anything to treat the virus. In fact the virus is not even deadly enough to spend this much effort to deal with.
0,"no worries, let him continue to spead the mis-information and more anti-maskers and anti-vaccine retards die, these retards are just wasting earth's resources, their deaths is the only good they will ever contribute to society."
2,I'm no fan of this abortion law. But this is concerning that parts of the country are officially deciding to effectively put sanctions on other parts of the US. I barely even like it when we sanction foreign countries ffs.
2,"I THINK THESE CONCERNED TEXAS CITIZENS SHOULD PAY FOR THE CARE & UPBRINGING OF SAID UNWANTED CHILDREN.
OH YA,THATS WHAT FOSTER CARE DOES.BUT THAT METHOD OF CARE DOES NOT SEEM TO CHURN OUT ANY REAL LAW ABIDING CITIZENS."
1,this just another left wing rubbish
2,Pretty sure Texans don‚Äôt care one iota about Portland or their politics...
2,Even though Texas ranks is the number ninth it slowly catching up to California because California is starting to feel the pinch of the pandemic since California lives off of borrowed money it's not really going to last long for the state which is why so many Californians left California for Texas. I don't like this reference but they called Texas the Western version of China in the US. I doubt the state would even notice Portland at all.
1,This is 100% political theatre.  Ted Wheeler is universally hated by progressives in Portland and he knows it.
2,I have been married in two states. Texas and Indiana. On both my marriage applications there is a question that ass are you at least second cousins? That is an actual question on the application. When I asked about it I was told it‚Äôs a old law that you have to be at least second cousins to be married in Texas. I seen the same question on my Indiana marriage license application.
2,"Lotta sad little trolls out these days, eh? Poor little guys. They have nothing of substance, especially a legitimate ideology, and resort to wasting their time trolling a left leaning podcast. I'd suggest maybe pick up a real hobby or start drinking or something."

2,"TYT wants to legalize heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine, but wants Vaccine mandates, wants to legalize abortion, and legalize transgenders using  women's bathrooms. Their medical IDEOLOGIES are all over the place."
1,I live in Portland and this is just performative. Today Wheeler said the police don't have to comply with city employees vaccine mandate after the police union threatened to quit. He's totally ineffective. People are trying to recall him.

One hundred and fifty thousand people die every day. How many of them were ready?

When you stand before God on that day will you go to heaven or hell? 

Jesus Christ tells us that unless you‚Äôre born again you will not see the kingdom of God. You will be judged for your sins; all of the lies, the immoral thoughts, stealing, blaspheming and justly sentenced to hell.

But you don‚Äôt have to go to hell. Jesus Christ tells us that whosoever repents of their sins and trusts in him can be saved. Jesus paid the penalty of your sins on the cross at Calvary two thousands years ago. 

What sin is worth an eternity in hell? Think how precious your eyes are to you, what would it take to sell your eyes? And how much for valuable the soul that looks out of those eyes? Don‚Äôt go to hell, repent and trust in Jesus and be saved."

0,Every time when I see videos like this I am reminded of that Dave Chapell skit about a black-white supremacist and Kanye West's completely idiotic statement about slavery and I ask myself are these morons for real or are they doing this as a grift. Where ever their reasons are people like Larry Elder prove you don't have to be White to be a White Supremacist. You just have to agree with their fascist ideologies and policies if that means you'll rake in millions of dollars in serving and submitting to the White Elites and White Supremacists of this country who have systematically and purposefully oppressed people of color since the Spanish and the Puritans first landing on this continent.
2,Elder is right but the way he puts it is wrong. But stating that he says slave owners DESERVE reparation's is not what he said. Both sides are going way too far in battling each other when divided we fall.

2,Professor Tony Martin has done the most in depth research on who exactly dominated the slave trade.

I could see students doing most of their studies online and once or twice a week actually face-to-face with an instructor teacher that can go through their material with them do any explanations that I needed help them with any corrections that are needed it's a simple thing nobody has to make this such a big deal. All we have to do is vote America first and there's only one way to go for that and it's Donald Trump the man who wrote The Art of the deal nobody can do better than him he's the master of the deal and that's what our country needs a strong force but never got down that has a good view of the future and what it could be like one way or the other and I'm all for the one way Donald Trump.

   If you send out a poll to a group of ppl who approve of you, then the results are irrelevant. 
  That's what most if not all of these polls are always anyways. 
   A poll they sent out to ppl that they already know like them. 
   Or they only poll a select group of ppl. 
  A poll that they or ppl that support them paid for or conducted. Etc.

   It's hilarious. It means absolutely nothing.

1,intellect and common sense has nothing to do with color. Voting because of color as the number one reason for voting is stupid.Unless of course you are a corporate head and the person of color even though they can't lead as Kamala is no leader would vote for her if she took lobby money from their corporation in return for immense income returns. Thats a reason why they get bailed out instead of the small mom and pop stores.They can't buy prosperity or freedom like corporations do.
0,Tucker Carlson ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. did you formerly work for the National Enquirer? Your supposed commentary sure sounds like it.  Fox News aka Propaganda News
2,"You know... when I was a kid I thought clowns were pretty cool... but I grew up... why won't these people in the media? oh yeah... and a complete lack of objectivity... I forgot :)

On the subject of the star spangled banner... The United States should not be waving any other flag. Nothing is a bigger display of U.S strength and unity than a flag that represents you all, regardless of the hue of your epidermis, political ideology or religion... and given the current state of affairs, it would be advisable to at least appear united to onlookers... even if it's not currently true.

As someone who lives in an U.S allied nation, it doesn't do our confidence well to see demonstrations of our allies political strife being played out in the open for all to see... it may embolden some... and that will not end well for any of us :( Please... get it together and soon."
2,"This is the sad truth about our country but it seems as though it's a popularity  contest. We need to teach our kids to use their heads , look things up for themselves know what your talking about and don't get behinds someone just based on them being liked. Fact check them . Vote for people who are qualified to do these jobs and have been for years"

1,Kamala sucked her way into office. Period.
0,"It's a sad reality.  Most if not all of the world hate America.  That's before the Afgan retreat.  What is even sadder is most Americans think they are still some kind of world leader.  Apart from the fine military, the US has nothing legitimate to say to the rest of the world."
1,A Demi-god of the underworld‚Ä¶ more like THE JOKER‚Ä¶

1,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JUST IN TIME FOR HALLOWEEN....I GIVE YOU THE HARRIS. YEAHHHH. SHE NEVER FAILS TO UN-IMPRESS ME. SO UN-SMART. MUCH LIKE HER SIDE KICKASS BIDEN. WHAT A PAIR THEY ARE.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GOD BLESS US FROM THEM.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Demi-gurd?
1,"Kamala is even an even more radical anti-American than Biden, so I'm afraid if Biden does get impeached, will have just gone from the frying pan to the fire, and then there's Pelosi, so God help us all with this triangle of evil ruling our nation."
2,Kamala Disney is controlled by CCP as is most of Hollywood Where is US culture and ideal's gone or controlled by whom ? CCP & Disney CHANGE DNA & COULOUR at will Make believe is great on screen don't work well in real life
2,Obama chose her.

WWG1WGA"
2,"As a person of color, I don't appreciate this crap putting people in charge just because of color. Put people because of Competency. I'd rather put an alien from Mars there if they haven't gone extinct yet... Of course if they are competent"

2,I've never been to Europe.  Well you're  not in charge of a crisis that's going on in Europe.
1,"we don't care what f color she is , harris Biden got to go"
1,It‚Äôs not an accomplishment when you are hand picked solely based on  your race and gender. She is the ultimate example of virtue signalling.
1,Inpeach her she is so fake just like sleepy joe is they are America's major problem
2,Obama was just as unknown am unchecked an nobody cared
2,"She even said she listened to Biggie, and Tupac in college. What is up with Democrats and dead people!! Dead people who cannot vote, cannot sing, nor make decisions for themselves. lol"
2,USA is finished.
2,"0. K. Let's admit it. George Dubya's war on terror has been an enormous waste of time, human suffering, and money. $3.000.000 a day for the last twenty years, according to some reports. Now, there are more homegrown terrorists in America than it's possible to shake a stick at. Think what Bin Laden would have felt if his supporters could have achieved the same as Trump's on 21."
2,"Isn't she?!
She's the first president of the United States that never runned to be president.

Or do you think that Biden rules anything?"
1,When we impeach biden we impeach his administration too. That means kakamala too.

2,Maybe she's a science experiment going bad in the refrigerator of the   White House. ü§®
2,Give her a gag and tell her to step down along with looney political partner in charge.  Both are a disgrace and embarrassment to this country. Neither one of them are capable of doing the most important job in this country... PROTECT AND SUPPORT the people that pay their salaries... WE THE PEOPLE.
1,"Sounds like they are turning Kamala Harris into Princess Diana. 

America has no thought what she will do. Because she is a pawn of the right color, but does not have the ability to think on her feet. 

If you asked me, all this time we‚Äôve been told that White people are systemically racist. On the contrary. White people really aren‚Äôt but the people of color will vote for someone who is there color despite that the one most of note was a RED DIAPER BABY!"
2,"As a Guatemalan, i assure you, the of a vice president is last thing ppl are focused on in a 3rd world country like Guatemala..that silly mindset doesn't exist there..survival is the mindset there...plus,Barack obama is the 1st black PRESIDENT..so a asian female VICE PRESIDENT isn't a game changer,..everyone wants to be the ""first"", everyone wants to be an icon..smh.."
1,"It is sad that the first ""woman vice president"" that is  OF COLOR, make sure to get THAT right btw, is this cackling hyena disgrace that's apart of an even more disgraceful administration that consistanly shows the absolute downgrade of our American government."
1,"I'd say it's a good time for Trump to demand the reins be handed back over to him since they were illegally & fraudulently withheld from him, for all this time anyway."
2,If I was a person of color I would be leery of a Vice President who's parents held people of color as slaves.
2,Feminism is absurd now? Lol ok
2,Poor poor people
2,"One difference between Trump and Harris, Harris would have you working for free in a prison, Trump would have you working for cash"
2,"Of course, the ""relationship"" with gov brown had nothing to do with her ""going places"""
2,Super heroes are born not aborted.  Where is Kamala on this  issue?
1,Does AOC know...anything?
2,How many idiots does it take to elect her? Just amazing.
2,Parents making a bad choice to come here illegally
2,Go to the statue of liberty
2,AOC is a Box of Rocks!
2,Glad to see the USA also has RAGA (Rahul Gandhi) kind of people üòÇ
1,"They, the liberal left, have no problem whatsoever removing a baby from a mother‚Äôs womb, all be it a full term or not, but yet they do supposedly have a problem with removing a child from a mother entering the border illegally. How upside down is that?"
2,She wouldn't anything now since they are taking away unvaxxed children from their unvaxxed parents. It's all nefarious political agenda in the of side bad to plummet the country of it's sovereign glory ordained from God.
1,AOC is the only waitress that can‚Äôt bring something to the table.
2,"someone give the woman her old job back, please 
All she was good at was knocking on doors and making big  promises.
Let it be a lesson to all in politics.
Any ignoramus can get elected into office if he knocked enough doors and promised big enough."
2,What kind of ‚Äúfamily‚Äù separates themselves from their children??? I don‚Äôt understand this.  I know women here that have left their children behind in another country.  What mother does that? . I would NEVER leave my children behind
2,Seeking asylum? Go through a legal point of entry.
1,"AOC is a real credit to her worshippers, the American left üòÇ both have no sense"
1,"AO-C want 200,000 Afganistan in the US. Let's put them in her districts, we will have an American Afgan representatives from that district, win win.  People cross the border, with no means of supporting their children or commit crimes are separated from their kids all the time."
2,"Homan is a rock star! He didn't budge, calmly explaining facts to a mentally challenged girl is playing congress woman! LOL."
2,"If this clown managed to get elected then now i truly beleive ' nothing is impossible """
1,How embarrassing for you AOC!!!!!!!
1,AOC your actually a Marxist....an Atheist and out of your mind!! Do your homework and stop putting the kids in danger and let illegal immigration happen..... you have done nothing to make things better.....you are bought and paid for!!!!!! This isn't something YOU have discovered!!!!!!!!
2,Who voted for this child.
1,This started when AOC and the rest of her screwed up party started recruiting foreigners to migrate to our borders and instructed them to break our laws!
1,"Kinda funny. The crisis at the border is 10 times worse now than it was then. Has anyone heard AOC whining lately about ""kids in cages?"" Yeah, I thought not. Hypocrites!!!!"
1,"People talk a bout the dangers of White supremacy but I see in AOC, the danger of Dumb supremacy."
1,AOC need to be removed from her position because she doesn't know anything and all she knows is how to read from a piece of paper smh ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1,AOC the smartest dumb girl ever.
1,"Does she actually care about family separation and the family unit? Absolutely not. How can someone on the left support abortion and all the heinous school indoctrination (neither of which regard all human life as precious) and then make this argument? The Left is doing all they can to destroy the family unit and replace God with government. 
Pray for children and the future of our nation. 
-A Stay at Home Mom"
2,The children are with Coyote's not their Parents! Cartel's are making millions of dollars on these children it's a known fact!
2,How these people get elected is beyond me.  Why defend those that break the law???  üò°üò°
2,"I don't really like AOC, but damn, she is hot af üíØüî•"
2,How did she get here she has no idea what the laws are ? DA
1,"Its illegal so you can shoot them down right ?
They are illegal so you can seperate children from their parents....

There is something called proportionality in law and AOC is right... Most people are just racist and have no clue what they are talking about...."
1,"AOC lying again!
She is the most dishonest politician in Washington!"
1,"When AOC speaks, she can make a tree stump look like a genius."
2,"Pretty sad that we've got a child in Congress, I don't think she would remember to breathe if her brain didn't tell her to"
1,AOC is a child that needs to grow up. She‚Äôs all feelings.
2,I'm guessing there's not a great deal of familiarity with the Geneva Convention among commenters here.
2,So why then isn't it a crime when Joe Biden allows them to enter American territory by close to a million people by now?????
2,and people actually vote for that idiot?
2,"She has no idea how the system works. Seeking legal asylum still means you have to have permission to enter the country, otherwise you ILLEGALLY entered."
2,She makes us Puerto Ricans look bad! This woman has no place in politics but maybe a talk show with Oprah. üòï
1,"What a joke! Boy she tried to twist the narrative but he answered her with TRUTH and up holding the USAs laws upon entry into this country. You know something. Maybe some one has answer. Why do they (you know who ‚Äúthey‚Äù are) want to  become an American citizen, but WANT TO CHANGE EVERYTHING OUR COUNTRY STANDS FOR? God, family, country! 
Lee, Grant, Calhoun, Stonewall Jackson, the men still today in the Marines, Army, Air Force, Navy... who fought (fighting) to KEEP OUR FREEDOMS. 
Get your Bibles
Get your guns
Get ready..."
1,AOC wants to be Fidel Castro so bad

1,Arrest the illegals period
1,"Humm let‚Äôs think , illegal boarder crossing , it in the name it‚Äôs a crime  ‚Äú illegal ‚Äú. She claims to of gone to college , that seems questionable !"
2,"Why vote for this complete idiot and liar. They really like harming our country for their personal benefit. So disgusting, should be illegal."
2,AOC was about to cry LOL
2,Dump all those and divert all those illegal entry people to her home. She will be set üòú once for all. Crazy lady.
1,Getting older is a given. Growing up is optional. Some people are happy to be juvenile all their life and AOC is a prime example.
2,these sort of hearing should be conducted here in India. let the people know who is the fool.
2,My daughter was took by the department of Job and family Services because I grew up in the system I had no drug habits or anything so if you want to fight for immigrants to keep their children but what about the Americans that lost our  children to the department of Job and family Services system
2,"This woman looks arrogant, not having any understanding of law and looks like she is not suitable for any government post either secretary of a department or as a government employee."
2,Wow AOC actually did some research for once but then she conveniently assumed 'illegally' also meant legally which is not what the document says.
1,A.O.C Talieb and Omar Should Be Locked Up In Prison For Treason Against The American People and Humanity
1,Does AOC   '' WAKE  UP ''  Or Not After This Hearing Or Is She Basically  '' LOST '' !!!!!
1,"AOC is a huge hypocrite because she advocates by her actions what she seeks to deny in her rhetoric. Like everything on the left, she lies very well about what she is actually doing."
2,This is a woman who graduated with honors in Economics and INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS!! Boston University has a lot to answer for.
2,"The mainstream media is SILENT.

WATCH more Mark Levin: "
1,The people that created the covid vaccine  (derick Rossi and some women Karol.) we‚Äôre supervised by dr fauci at the nih.  I think there‚Äôs some kinda conspiracy goin on here.   Really!!!!!
1,"It upsets me that people see Fauci as the big savior, and he was the instigator and supervisor of the production of this virus."
2,The same with Climate Change.
1,The American public will pay the price for allowing this senile puppet and his masters to destroy the christian fabric of this nation. Destruction is coming America!
1,When injustice is law resistance is duty. Thomas Jefferson.  It's time to vote them out and stop this communist takeover that world leaders want to control.
1,"Fauci knows nothing, he's being controlled by demons, the W, H, O, Bill Gates,and the New World Order, he knows the vaccine is spreading the virus and killing people."
2,The doctors who go against politicians get silenced!! The media is the virus!!
2,It's time LORD. It's time. Cleanup the trash in America and the world.

2,And how many die from the flu ?
1,"Exactly what I thought and knew and heard about a long time ago. 90% of any death has the hash tag, ""death by Covid"", even if the reason is ridiculous"
2,Look up tuberculosis deaths! We don‚Äôt quarantine for that????? This was a control test!!!
2,Funny no one got the flu in 2020
2,This was all pre-planned by the left
2,In my mind you cant support western medicine in general and not support the covid narrative. They are one in the same. Science projects. Intended fpr a particular result. The result not being what the recipient thinks it will be.
1,Frankenstein fauci facilitates appocolytic viruses! coverup specialists! Resulting in mail in ballots results Venezuela style election! landslide at midnight! Come on man!
1,I've been saying the same thing I was telling everyone I know that the doctors I use to work with were pressured to put down covid when it started regardless of what the person death was. Also we got word after the election when patato head cheated some of the employees at the hospital said they weren't gonna do no more screening.
1,"The President, (""our President of the United States""), has just not only saved the United States Citizens, ""(our family members)"";' but He, has saved the World also with this vaccine.. We the People,  and the World;  ( ""THANK YOU"",; President TRUMP ),."

1,"I will never take that poison and I will die fighting it this is a government conspiracy to weed out the population, let them give it to the black and brown illegal communities first"
1,"If you die by falling off a ladder, they will say you've died from covid !"
1,"We know the hospitals were making money for the reported covid diagnosis. The government paid hospitals: $13k per day every patient, for every ventilator used $48k, for every 120 patients reported to have covid $$78 k..  Hospitals wanted deaths reported as covid causes, although few were actually for covid, because it was a money maker!!!"
1,Scam by democrats! They all belong in jail!
1,"Plandemick! Dems, china and fauci  did this to pull off there coup!"
1,Dr Fauchi was deeply involved in the creation of this virus together with Bill Gates
2,Mail-in ballots proved to be the cure
1,COVID-19 numbers are just as inflated as Biden‚Äôs alleged votes
1,"Within 2 years, the Vaccinations will kill more people, than the virus. SM-102 ‚ò†"
1,"I heard er has been told to list all deaths even gunshot as Covid.
This is to keep the numbers up and Validate the need for Vax.
Like N. Korea, ""You can lead a Country with Fear."""
1,Fauci needs to be Prosecuted for War Crimes.
2,Are you nuts Leven they get paid more money for claiming covid deaths gosh maybe I should be a journalist! This has been common knowledge for more than a year!
2,SO HAPPY THE TRUTH IS FINALLY COMMING OUT.     PLANDEMIC!!!!

2,I was told by healthcare workers ) friends ) who are never heard.5-23-21 and just hearing this now.
2,The reaaon the Doctors are being pressured to increase the numbers is because hospitals get paid more for Covid deaths.
,I don't believe in the vaccine
1,"Stop listening Mark Levin since began pushing the vaccine as American ingenuity, and Trump succeeds without knowing o maybe he did that was experimental and that long collateral damage is no known. 
Also big guns like him, Beck, Savage,Hannity, are betting on take the house back .its a mistake, our Federal government is broke.the Fight is in the STATES LEGISLATURES. The only guy who understands that is DANIEL HOROWITZ. Who is organizing Patriots volunteers in each red state to push Republican politicians 
To follow the constitution.  Unfortunately none of the talk radio is promoting his agenda. Shame on them"
2,China got our money from him to create virus biowepon.
2,THIS IS BEING DONE TO SEE HOW FAR THEY CAN PUSH US . THE DEEP STATE ARE EVIL SATANIST SOB'S . WAKE UP PEOPLE .
2,My friend he was in the gain off function research even the department say no then he move to china the study that's was the mistake because they're using ccp virus as a weapon
2,"....the Dems Moaned, complained, Fought NOT to have Legally Correct Actions to recount Disputed Election Ballots!  Think they‚Äôre going to go to Investigate False Death certificates?!  No matter WHAT evidence was uncovered?"
1,What I am witnessing everyday is extremely bothering. Folks having so much fear won't even take off a mask while outside although the CDC indicated those vaccinated can. Once we lose faith in the air we breathe we are deeply at a lost . Never chose to wear a mask outside since mask wearing became prevalent nor have any interest in taking a vaccination. Are we forgetting the power of our own immunity system. I cherish the sciences as well as a healthy lifestyle. The immunity systems will fight off anything if we took care of ourselves accordingly. Stop allowing your system to turn into a garbage disposal. Take time to do some form of exercise.
2,100+in agreement. Trump was making efforts to have Fauci dismiss
2,the numbers are being pumped up by liars period Levin get it right it's not bad data gathering it's pure lies.
2,"The US government r playing politic & habe hidden agenda. This has been ingrain √¨nto  the government system So no matter which party is in control, it will just cruse along. It will eventually destroy US & western along with iy one day. God have mercy on u lot"
2,"Could not agree anymore with what is mentioned in this video.  We need to trust the science, but why? If we trusted the science, why are CDC recommendations changing month-to-month? We trust the science one month then have to start trusting it in another direction.  
When something doesn't seem right or make sense, typically isn't!"
1,It's all in the leftist socialist agenda.
2,"Well now, a year later and Mr Fauci is still blithering on and on with his ever changing story.  Dr Ericson and his group have all been stifled ... what more do you need to now. Senator Dr Rand Paul gave Fauci a grilling over NIH funding p4 lab gain of function research. He tried to deny it but Senator Paul had him by the short hairs"
2,"I remember if anyone who smoked died of lung cancer, they would automatically say it was the smoking, iven if the cancer was caused by something else or metastasized from another organ. They wouldn't even look to see."

1,"I don't know where Sarah Palin went to school, but she is clearly a bonafide genius. This woman's intellect is off the charts. Her intuition is unparalleled and her wisdom is a joy. Her boobs look great too, for a woman her age."
2,"On 6 Jan 2021 the Congress was discussing the possibility of an illegal election. Before the 1st protested state, Arizona, had the full evidence of the irregularities exposed... a fully orchestrated, illegal, domestic terrorist backed riot took place in the Capitol. The intent of the ""deep state"" was realized when the riot stopped the legitimate debate on the issue at hand. Congress was evacuated and the debate stopped. The Capitol was cleared of rioters, and later that evening, Congress returned and, as expected, the fire for finding the problem had burned out, as the ""deep state"" planned it. There are videos of Capitol Police waving the protestors onto the Capitol lawn and into the building. According to some, facial recognition software has identified ""Antifa"" members in the rioting crowd. As they did in the summer riots, normally peaceful people were antagonized by the anti fascists and followed along. The end result was attained... justifying the means. Debate stopped and Biden was certified by unchallenged slates of electoral votes. The Georgia challenge and the few challenges that came afterward received overwhelming votes against and the electoral protest procedure was halted in tis tracks. Not unexpectedly, there were soon calls from the left for V.P. Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the POTUS... and if he doesn't agree, we will start impeachment proceedings. The ""deep state"" has tried for 4 years to remove Donald J. Trump from office an they will not stop... even 12 days before the end of his term. ""He is dangerous!"", they say. ""He incited a riot!"", they say. The truth is, that with the intelligence that he still has access to... he is a threat to their illegal livelihood and has been for 4 years. It scares them to death that their truths may be revealed. For the left and the deep state, it is truly a matter of life and death to remove Trump. As Hillary Clinton said, (paraphrased), ""If that S.O.B. gets elected, we'll all hang by nooses."" Truer words were never spoken. Donald Trump was not as vindictive as he should have been, and he allowed them to slide. BIG MISTAKE!!!! A majority of the left and a goodly portion of the right are involved in enriching themselves from activities that are surely less than above board in the USA. They all fear the consequences. Some would surely face death for their crimes. We can only pray that justice will be served."
1,"Patriots and True conservatives, dump all the technology company stocks who have banned Trump and Conservatives. You are the one making them rich and cut their branches one by one.  Also do not support any company, person or media who is against freedom of expression."
2,Palin is not someone I! would want to be associated with. Those who actually educate themselves about these things compare her to Palosi or Feinstein. She's a mental case nut job with to much power.

I think those who own guns are the ones who shouldn't.

0,Nobody needs an AR15 to defend themselves.  There is no need to have a weapon which can hold upto 25 rounds of ammunition and fire off that ammunition ina automatic mode.  All pushing to have households to be allowed to have weapons means that households are going to absolutely need them.  The only beneficiaries to this are the ultra wealthy who can have their own armed guards and the weapons companies.  The rest of the country suffers.

Plus, I can't rely on the police since y'all idiots keep blocking the streets as you riot and protest the same police you want me to call in an emergency. No thanks, I'll stick with my guns and not have to worry about calling the police."
2,Who do you need to be protected from if you don't have guns? Just buy a stungun on amazon.
1,"Criminals by nature don't five a F about the law. Make guns illegal and only the criminals will have them. I'd like to think these anti 2A people have a sinister agenda, but knowing many of them, most of them are deeply naive and unfortunately stupid. And then there are those with an agenda. We have 2A exclusively for ""them""."
2,"Damn this guy nailed it.  All I can say is I guess the joke goes if a republican can't rely on police, they let Jesus take the wheel"
1,"""We have a system that's built to protect us.""
Where the hell does this man live?
I live on a rural farm, and have only had to call the Sheriff's deputies twice in 32 years. One time took them 30 minutes to arrive. The other time took 45minutes. My wife and I will keep our firearms."
1,"Hasn't Mexico outlawed private ownership of guns? Well, now the country is awash with cartels who can do pretty much whatever they want to the unarmed civilians, and they do."
2,The IQ of this clown strategist doesn't allow him to distinguish between a vigilanti and self defense
2,But all these federal agencies and SWAT will keep them I guarantee you
1,300 lb. black man is an idiot!
1,Brainwashed a smart person to get USSR results.  Apparently method still works. Senator Boxer former california ‚Äúrepresenting‚Äù California called for all gun owners to voluntarily turn in weapons.  She made a BIG deal in media coverage of putting her guns into pile.  ... later it was discovered she kept UNREGISTERED guns at home. This man was brainwashed.  So defund police is next step in his future or stand up to defend his American rights under constitution. Which will it be?  He has right to abdicate but should respect everybody else‚Äôs right to protect themselves OR head off to China for more intense indoctrination and loss of all his finances under great reset - China leads world in use of social media to control everyone.  First rule down that path is disarm population. Communists ALWAYS do that. So do dictators.

1,Typical democrat can't answer the question and they also are against our second amendment rights and nazi üá©üá™ mentality when it comes to firearms üî´!!!!!!!
1,"Why does the left feel that every law abiding firearm owner, owns one to use it on other humans?  Something tells me that those who are against firearms are just telling you ""what"" they would do if they owned a firearm!  Lesson being, those against firearms should not be allowed to own, or even handle, a firearm."
1,Democrats are so dumb.
2,I wish Liz would go off on libtards more often because she is great at it.  This tool bag needs to go pound sound.

2,"This was an official, on the record, approved by NATO deal to get rid of a corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine! Viktor Shokin refused to press corruption charges against the previous administration, TWO YEARS before Hunter Biden was offered the job at Burisma. He may not have been experienced, but he is well educated, and I would very much like someone to show me a pay stub, because I am curious about how much they paid to regain respectability. 

That‚Äôs what they thought they were getting, after the Ukrainian Revolution, and the removal of the previous corrupt government and the former owner of Burisma. The Ukrainians are desperately fighting for their independence from Russia and its influence. They mistakenly thought it would look good to hire the USVP‚Äôs son. That‚Äôs all there is to that."
2,It is a shame what they are purposely doing to this great nation we don't deserve any of this  WE HAVE TO STOP THE GREED AT THE TOP SO OUR COUNTRY CAN HEAL WE ARE THE BEST

1,"Biden administration failed all categories of the US Constitution and Declaration of Independence. They stole the (videos of Absolute Proof by Michael Lindell) election and don't care about the USA citizens.

1,"Americans need to fight to get Trump back into office. At least Trump fights against corruption, were as Biden is so corrupt to the core."
2,That‚Äôs a Democrat for you but you know what we can see through all the smoke the curtain has been pulled back and we are not going to be fooled any longer and
2,That‚Äôs OK they can hate them we don‚Äôt care because that‚Äôs Republicans love him and his family

1,"There are some Americans who understand war very well! They are known as the Industrial military complex, with great support from the democratic party, aka the new Communist party of America. Once we get out of Afghanistan they will give it a LITTLE time to blow over. And then they will find another 20-year war to continue that money flow!!!"
2,"Chris is a sucker for the Globalist Elites who start these stupid wars, and he needs to think a bit more deeply instead of being naive and gullible.
Just ask yourself a simple question:  Do the super rich Globalist Elites ever send their children or grand children to fight their stupid wars?
Our very own Henry Ford built trucks for the German Wermacht during WW2 in Cologne and while the whole of Cologne was littered bombed flat to the ground by the Allies, miraculously the Ford factory in Cologne remained undamaged.
Wake up."

2,"Virtually everyone serving in the military doesnt understand it either, particularly kids with virtually no life experience."
2,"Chris Kyle, like Stephen Glass, was a serial fabulist who told fabricated story after fabricated story. Mr. Kyle‚Äôs medal count claim was contradicted by the United States Department of Navy. His ‚ÄúHurricane Katrina Sniper Story‚Äù was contradicted by both Army Lieutenant General Russell Honore and the United States Special Operations Command.

Mr. Kyle‚Äôs ‚ÄúPunching Jesse Ventura Story‚Äù was contradicted by the Coronado Police, while his ‚ÄúTexas Car Jacking Story‚Äù was contradicted by both the Johnson County Sheriff and the Johnson County District Attorney.

Considering the trove of fabricated stories told by Chris Kyle that have been discredited by both military and law enforcement personnel, it is highly likely that many of the stories contained in Mr. Kyle‚Äôs book also have been fabricated, either partially or totally."
2,"this guy was full of himself 
do the job you signed up for and dont expect the tax payer to pat you on the back all the god damned time 
I heard he made up stuff in his book too although the constant ""thank us for our service"" is the more obnoxious"
2,"Most Americans don't understand the TRUTH about the war, many fighting it don't either, including kyle"
2,He a con artist him and his wife profiting from lies over lies
2,If you.know someone that fought in Vietnam or Korea or www and they talked to you you know war. My daddy talked about crawling. Over dead bodies that were rotting. My friends in Korean war. About being shot at. My friends in Vietnam had nightmares of dropping bombs knowing that they are also killing Children . All of the above goes for.modern war. God bless them all. Pray fir them abs be their friend.
2,"Anyone disliking this interview should be sent for a week of basic training. Men and women in the military should be held far higher in regard than any movie star,musician and most certainly,politicians. Thank you to all who have served,past ,present and who will in the future!"

2,"This popped up in my recommendation out of nowhere and all I can say is, give us a few more months maybe sooner and America will be in a civil war."
2,They don't know war never had anything bad happen.spoiled brats that don't get thier way
2,"Most American's realize that Wars are Created for Profit and Control... 
and for a Government to Use its people to Fight and Die in a Foreign Land for Nothing more than Profit and Control... well, Not Good.
It is Governments that spread False Claims to enter into ie

2,"don't worry americans, now pregnant women will protect you."
2,The man who made a living and  bragged about murdering hundreds of people which was never verified. No one in military should ever brag about murder. liar
2,I don't believe it's possible to understand war without training and serving to save your life and other's lives. On top of that there are lessons only historical studies can teach us and that takes years. People are too innocent to understand war and I think that's a good thing but there's a lot of work left to do here and abroad and ignorance is no excuse.
2,Agreed most Americans don‚Äôt understand war. They just want to enjoy their lifestyle and let others do the dirty work

I watched and thought it was an excellent movie that gave many of us just a little hint of what he and ALL the others who served over there had to deal with...
The hardest part for me,  was the tail end when suddenly you hear what starts out like TAPS ,  then flows into the beautiful closing theme,  Along with  the LONG FUNERAL procession  coming down the Interstate with all the LIGHTS  &  FLAG bearing Bikes driving down through the Hundreds of people lined up alongside the highway  & the bridges in the rain to pay their respects to a true Americanüá∫üá∏Hero ;  And I was in tears,  and then the picture of COWBOY  STADIUM where HUNDREDS were gathered to say goodbye...

He was right about Americans not understanding war but he's a hypocrite lying about it and glorifying it.   He also made up a lie about Jesse Ventura saying that he was smearing veterans so he beat up Ventura.  Absolute fiction."
2,Redskin name show just show the brainwashing people get when they keep doing racism.
2,As a native american i am offended that you change the redskins name and not the cowboys why do white people still get a team and we dont
2,"I'm white. I've been white all my life. I have Indian friends. I've asked them are you offended by being called an Indian. Each time I was told know because they grew up with the word. Do I ask them are they offended by the grade school BIG Chief Writing tablet. They said know. 

If I had to be identified politically, I'm left, and I'm really tired of white people panic with all the PC titles. 

No one I know has ever asked the person they felt should be offended IF they are offended. They just assume. It makes me nuts."
2,The VERY few people that actually support this are not interested in what actual Native Americans have to say. It has nothing to do with not causing offense; it is 100% about control.
2,"the indians had a face in nfl, not anymore"
1,"The only people who want the name change are arrogant, stupid, no common sense, s**t for brains liberals in this country."
1,"They should change the name to "" The Washington Mexicans "".  That would make all Mexicans proud that they can finally  cross the border illegally with the blessings of ""Hyena"" Harris and the dummycRATs in Washington and be part of the American dream."
1,Whenever there‚Äôs a race issue 95% of the people offended are white liberals and a good 5 % are the group actually offended therefore liberals are snowflakes
1,Woke left destroying America ‚Ä¶ losers
2,"Just be the Washington Crooks, you already have a bunch of mascots at the capital."

2,Would you walk up to a Native- American and call him or her a redskin?
2,Why don‚Äôt the NY Jets change their name? Doesn‚Äôt their name partially reference one of the biggest terrorist attacks on AMERICA? While we‚Äôre at it let‚Äôs give the right to have a say about it to every single person who wasn‚Äôt affected by it!
1,"Actually, the offended cancel culture babies have taken something away from the Native American by denying them tributes to their ancestry. Those titles of teams as respectful and honorable. It is a shame the Indian nation did not see it that way and come in defense of the team and themselves.  This isn't the first time this has happened. The cancel culture couldn't care less if the native American dropped out of sight into obscurity and eventual extinction.  
Shame on the native Americans for not speaking out in defense of themselves."
2,"Redskins is racism towards native Americans apparently. 
Imagine if a team was named ‚ÄúBlack skins‚Äù people would be offended and call it racism towards black people. 
If a team was called White skins people would say it‚Äôs white supremacy. Funny how that works"
1,Democrats are the biggest racist on Earth an Indian should be ashamed of themselves for following the slave drive and Democrat that are truly racist and killed them off

    Plan Parenthood and the Hindering Government programs have done great harm to Native American Indians than name changes ever could!"
2,nam--> vietnam- dumb as- gookologists!
2,How about they change the name to the caucasiens. Then we‚Äôll see how ‚Äúracist‚Äù it truly is.
2,It‚Äôs obviously cultural pride..... who names their own cities team after an insult?? It‚Äôs American history. We fought the natives for hundreds of years. The reason we name it the Jeep Cherokee is because it‚Äôs viewed as badass..... not insulting.
0,Removal of the Awesome Native American logo was EXTREMELY DISCRIMINATORY!
2,I totally agree when I take the shirt off my white brows and women oh you are so white never got a tan however 10 hrs in sun I am a real redskin then I was rushed to hospital for burns I would love to have red skin and beautiful black k hair
0,Breaking news: Native Americans are able to have varying opinions. I too am a Native American and I am against Native mascots in areas where Natives are a minority. I shockingly have the audacity not to speak for other people so yes there are Natives who aren't offended and yes there are Natives who are against Native mascots. I don't know who needs to hear this but Native people don't get together and decide a collective opinion and then the rest of us have to follow it.
2,"The Redskins can avoid the racist charge by changing their mascot to a Redskin Potato! :-)

Many teams have aggressive names: the Bears, the Bengals (tigers), the Eagles, etc.  In a similar vein, the name Redskin was chosen because American Indians were viewed as tough warriors.  It was really intended as a compliment.

The people claiming that Redskins is a racist term have not been able to find a single documented instance of the term Redskins being used in a derogatory manner since the 1920s.  It's doubtful there is single person alive who has heard the term Redskins used as a racial slur.  The meanings of a word sometimes changes and the word Redskins is one such word.  Redskin hasn't been a slur in at least a century."
1,See they don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs just white liberals taking away heritage
2,Isn't it racist to change the name and logo? Change the color red also
2,Gary Clark of the Washington Redskins conducted at least 3 football camps at Native American reservations during his career. He wanted to know if they thought the Redskins name was racist. What he saw was Native Americans wearing Redskins gear and saying that they were proud to be a Redskin fan and the 5% that weren‚Äôt Redskins fans were Cowboys fans and that‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt like the name.
1,The minority wants to cancel everything
0,The name and logo never offended me. It was always the fans wearing headdresses and regalia they‚Äôd call ‚Äúcostumes‚Äù that‚Äôs the racist part people don‚Äôt understand
1,"Chief Operating Officers, Chief Chefs, Chief Surgeons, Fire Chiefs .....where does it freaking stop lib tards?
I think someone wants us to forget that native American ever existed.....my wife grandmother is Pawnee....that's what she thinks
It's all about white millienial women who have been taught to tell guilty, wah wah. Notice how native Americans aren't even offended
Past.  White man takes land"
0,"Present.   Leftists forces our opinions"""
2,It‚Äôs funny how white people decide what‚Äôs racist for other races.
1,Wouldn't the Vikings be racist too??? LOL
1,Yes I totally agree change the name and let‚Äôs stop promoting Native Americans as warriors let‚Äôs stop promoting these people as successful I think we should totally change the name and I think we should totally stop using well these people who are here first who are successful at building well piles of dirt as successful and admirable societies
1,is there anything people are not offended by today?
0,biden is an idiot and our government stole America in 2020
1,"Nothing will be done as usual. The Clintons have the powers bribed to keep them out of jail. Like the FBI who have never started or done an investigation of why over 26 individuals that were set to testify against Hilary were suddenly found DEAD. *5 of them died the night before they were to appear to testify. Nothing done. If she can get away with that then EMAILS are a JOKE to her and she is sitting and laughing, as the *Deep State continues to rule our lives whether we like it or not."
