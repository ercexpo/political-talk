There is still a problem with landlords justifying evictions and against the law causing people to move out within a day's notice and having their security deposits stolen. Landlords can continue to make security deposits over false notions and make people's lives worse. The houses are not necessarily being torn down. They're just converted. It would be nice if a studio apartment didn't cost more than you make at a minimum wage job that you have to walk to because you still can't afford a vehicle. Craziness.

And as anyone who's watched Fox knows, its fundamental message is rage at what liberals are doing to our country. Over the years the specific message has changed with the times ‚Äî from terrorism to open borders to Benghazi to Christian cake bakers to critical race theory ‚Äî but it's always about what liberal politicians are doing to cripple America, usually with a large dose of thinly veiled racism to give it emotional heft...

The Fox pipeline is pretty simple. Fox News stokes a constant sense of outrage among its base of viewers, largely by highlighting narratives of white resentment and threats to Christianity. This in turn forces Republican politicians to follow suit. It's a positive feedback loop that has no obvious braking system, and it's already radicalized the conservative base so much that most Republicans literally believe that elections are being stolen and democracy is all but dead if they don't take extreme action."" - Unknown"

They have left themselves with no choice, except to annihilate their enemies, or be annihilated, & that is exactly how they behave - like all the Palestinians must be annihilated, all their land taken, in order for Israel to exist, at all. That is a corner they backed themselves into - when they showed no willingness to show compassion to their fellow humans, or seek out peace, thru diplomacy - always resorting to brute force to achieve purely selfish ends, instead of cultivating peaceful relations, in a land they reside in, thanks only to the concessions others have made, on their behalf.

How massive is the debt in Israel? Why is the USA funding the Iron Dome replenishment? Am I missing something, is funding some metaphor I'm unfamiliar with? I'd think Iron Dome is something important enough that Israel would fund it without handouts from Uncle Sam."

1,"""Liberals, progressives, Democrats and other rational thinkers must accept one crucial reality if they are to save America's democracy: Those who live in the right-wing echo chamber really do believe what they are being told. Those beliefs are now extensions of their core identities...

And as anyone who's watched Fox knows, its fundamental message is rage at what liberals are doing to our country. Over the years the specific message has changed with the times ‚Äî from terrorism to open borders to Benghazi to Christian cake bakers to critical race theory ‚Äî but it's always about what liberal politicians are doing to cripple America, usually with a large dose of thinly veiled racism to give it emotional heft...

The Fox pipeline is pretty simple. Fox News stokes a constant sense of outrage among its base of viewers, largely by highlighting narratives of white resentment and threats to Christianity. This in turn forces Republican politicians to follow suit. It's a positive feedback loop that has no obvious braking system, and it's already radicalized the conservative base so much that most Republicans literally believe that elections are being stolen and democracy is all but dead if they don't take extreme action."" - Unknown"

2,Yeah let's see if we could be a little more clueless Fox News. Maybe you missed the point where they said there was no point in funding it with the deficit cap bill because it's already part of a defense bill that's going to be passed later this year so there was no need to tack it on twice. Nobody said it's not getting funded it's just not going to be funded with this bill then with the other bill later when it's already been approved with the defense bill that going to be passed in December

2. You want to talk about abandoning allies. Trump was the first and only U.S. President to abandon our allies on the field of battle, abandon a U.S. base and turn them both over to our arch enemy Russia, who rolled in the next day. Trump got no Kurds out of Syria, not one. The ISIS prisoners then released following this betrayal were quite likely some of the same ones who later planned the attack and killed 13 U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.
Wake up."

Government is supposed to work for the people, not the super rich and not for big corporations."

1,"No one FORCES an ABORTION...but YOU want to FORCE a vaccine? My body, MY CHOICE...or isn't it!! Sit Down!!"
2,Probably because they would have to pay more in taxes.
2,"They make so when a lobbyist comes along offering them millions in perks, it's hard to say no. Our government has a pay structure well-suited to the 1970's, but now it's simply too far behind the scale of what these folks could make in the private sector. A lot of people think we pay our elected officials too much, but the problem is that we don't pay them enough to not take lobbyist money."
0,You're what I'd call a closet Republican.
2,Codify this law now!
0,"I read today the deficit was 7.8 trillion. When are the Democrats going to realize the Republicans are playing them. There is no intention of the republicans agreeing to anything for the present, they are looking at the future. You can see that in what Trump is doing by supporting all these people in state positions dealing with elections, if the the elections in the future is very close. Your dealing with some very nasty, corrupt individuals, that will stop at nothing, to cheat to win. An example is the last Supreme Court judge that shows how evil they are. Again they have cheated in the past when they didn't have the votes and changed it to 50 votes to win. You never trust Moscow Mitch McConnell and you should know that by now. You want to do something positive, start getting the people in the Republican Party with all the criminal activity they have done in the last plus decade. Get them removed from office and put in prison if possible. There supporters don't care how corrupt Trump and the Republicans are. The more corrupt they are the better they like it. You saw who supports them and the type of people they are. It's going to be interesting how hard the punishment will be for the people that were arrested for the insurrection, who was involved in the planning, and weapons that were used to murder the people that lost their life and the type of injuries that caused their wounds. The intent was to do bodily harm to anyone in their way of the attack."
2,"What happened to the billions we voted for and approved for new and expanded water storage??? Yeah,,,, didn't happen, did it!?"

2,"So if they already took the bribes, does that mean they‚Äôre locked in and have to vote against the common good? Their constituents need to bombard them with messages to move them to do the right thing, or else."

0,"From a democratic CA constituent: RETIRE.
We have supported your ability to be in office longer than most. Your cognitive abilities are compromised, this is crazy. Diane do the NOBLE thing. It‚Äôs ridiculous to keep office as a procedural choice. You are not a true representation of what you used to be. Knowing Gavin Newsom won the recall election in stride - you could allow your Democratic replacement to have an opportunity to affect real change in our nation during this very critical time. While you can tend to your retirement and health needs."

But they did write the 2nd admendent to keep the goverment from taking our arms."
1,50 years ago we thought it was a blob. We know better now. It is inhumane butchery to abort a living feeling person that literally tries to get away from the blade. This is indefensible now that we know.
2,"Money run amuck in our political system. Both parties are guilty of selling us out over their own reelection and financial well being.
Shameful including the SCOTUS."

This Pandemic has definitely proved certain facts and having no money for the sick, the poor, the hungry, the homeless during the Republicans wrong in that when money has been given to individuals they have been spending it wisely for necessities rather than their being extravagant. They have been looking after their families, trying to pay for their housing despite climate change, Democrats show up for the people in need. They don't go on vacation , show up at the border, try to remedy during hurricanes, visit veterans try to help them out, try to pass infra structure bills so we get jobs, now you tell me what have we gotten from Republicans until this pass year?

1,"It's so hard to post controversial items on this senator's FB page. So I decided to INVADE and INTERRUPT this current string topic.Here's Gianna Jessen, (link) a rare survivor of this moral ABOMINATION that your senator championed when voting AGAINST Senate Bill 311: If it had passed, it would have protected the sometimes FULL-TERM survivors of infanticide abortions; abortions which are done WITHOUT anesthesia for the infant. If you read your senator's FB page, then you need to know about/"
2,These 'donations' are nothing but bribes and should be totally illegal.

2,You are not serving any of your constituents from any party at all if you aren‚Äôt at least working to find reasonable solutions in these areas.
2,Because they will be taxed too
2,"You have been FACT checked and found 100% FALSE. A supreme ct ruling is NOT ""settled law."" ONLY congress -- with the consent of the governed -- can make law if the SC makes setteld law then ""Plessy v Ferguson,"" ""Dred Scott v. Sanford,"" ""Korematsu v. United States,"" would still be law

1,Lol at democrats concerned over the debt
2,And now the billionaires are trying to make a 5th branch of army called space something. Give me a break. Let‚Äôs get things taken care of here first.
2,"That sounds like bribery, pure and simple, to me. How it can be legal is beyond me. It's like if a big company, pharma or oil company, were going to be judged in court and were slipping the judge large sums of money before hand. Actually mind boggling that no bill has been introduced to end. Could it be so many are accepting payola that no one wants to see it end."
2,These politicians need to be primary and taken out of Government.

2,"Can we stop pretending that any democrats are anything other than ""moderates"""
0,This is why Sinema votes against everything the Democrats try to pass. This is also why she and Manchin vote against getting rid of the filibuster... They care less about America and change. They should both be Republicans because they follow McConnell's lead. Getting rid of the filibuster is the only way to make change in the voting rights.
2,remember the supreme court said it was ok for corporations to donate as much money as they wanted...the long game is coming to fruit
2,We just got our tax return this week
2,"Surprise, surprise‚Ä¶.our very own Congress has been bought by corporate America! Wonder how long this has been going on?"
2,"We need to reverse Citizens United, and cap corporate donations to sitting politicians."
1,Because Democrats are massive rich and hypocrites...
0,"Seems to me that is because they are demonized for it by the republicans. The Republicans always convinced people that Democrats are not just taxing the rich, but that they will be taxing lower incomes also. It seems to work every time."

1,"Raising the debt limit authorizes Treasury (or is it the Federal Reserve Bank? hell if I know) to run the dollar bill printing press an hour more. If Democrats were serious about defending the dollar (and they ain't even serious about defending the cost of tea in China), they'd be cutting income tax rates (causing money to move out of tax-shelters) and taxing the royal dickens out of crude oil instead."
2,Bought and paid for by Big Pharma!

0,Can you send me an extra $2000 Dianne? Asking for the Democrats in this state...
2,Dems and Reps getting money from pharma must be voted out.
2,And start with the anti-democracy folks attending Davos and corrupting the world.
2,What we need to do is outlaw lobbyists!
2,Big Money owns us. Corporations should not be able to contribute to campaigns and there should be a cap on what individuals can contribute.
2,"So much greed, so much selfishness in the land......God is not pleased...Yes, you are right! You are rich in money and material things, but who are you? Just because you are rich and BIG that makes you powerful? Do you know that same hole that the poor are buried in, the rich have to live in that same hole!!!! The hold you will live your eternal life in, it is not lined with gold and silver and all your precious stones, houses, camps, boats, 3 wheelers and 4 wheelers and your big boats!!! no no, they are not. They are lined with mud and dirt, like everyone else......rotti

You said your kids and family would get it.....AND!!!! You will not see it! You will not come back and pull on their toes if they don't do it like you said......You will be DEAD! Gone and not returning......
.Just remember how greedy you are and your selfishness of the things that God has allowed you to own and have......How your greed and selfishness has set you apart from the love of God's Children. How those material things have divided the world, that you may claim you are living in your own world...wrong!!
! The world you living in belongs to God, not your.....You did not create it and you cannot keep it.......How rich are you and how you feel at the end of the day with you greed? Do you know what love is? Have you ever experience the love of the Lord in your life, your kids lives, your wife's life, your family? The love of money is the root of all evil.....What do you plan to do with the wealth that God has entrusted you with? Do you plan to share it with people in the love of God or your love? Because if it is not the love of God, that love is fake and a lie. Choose this day whom you will serve, the God of the wealth and famous or Jehovah God? Foe me, whether what I have, I will serve My Jehovah God with everything. How about you?

0,"All of these Pharma-owned so-called Democrats have a whole lot to answer for! It's high time that Congress enact laws that prevent and penalize members who attempt to profit from lobbyists while at the same time earning salaries as US Representatives
. The conflict of interest is glaringly absurd. It's time for the Biden Administration to enact laws that forbid any elected Congress person from receiving any form of compensation outside of the salary provided by virtue of their service (yeah, right) as an elected official. This bullshit has got to be stopped."

2,Another politician bought and paid for.
2,"again, i will state that taxing unrealized capital gains needs to be OFF THE TABLE. imagine that you were taxed on 10 million dollars of stock holdings. and then your stocks crashed.

Worst part is you can‚Äôt hold these people accountable because they make the rules and break them. The system is rigged and broken. But nothing will ever change. Ever.
