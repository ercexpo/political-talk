0,Well they voted him in twice so the people of California must be just fine with whatever he is doing elections have consequences
0,People are so broke in CA they have to rent a room in a house just to survive and stay off the streets and out of living in their vehicle. There is still a problem with landlords justifying evictions and against the law causing people to move out within a day's notice and having their security deposits stolen. Landlords can continue to make security deposits over false notions and make people's lives worse. The houses are not necessarily being torn down. They're just converted. It would be nice if a studio apartment didn't cost more than you make at a minimum wage job that you have to walk to because you still can't afford a vehicle. Craziness.

2,"""Liberals, progressives, Democrats and other rational thinkers must accept one crucial reality if they are to save America's democracy: Those who live in the right-wing echo chamber really do believe what they are being told. Those beliefs are now extensions of their core identities...

And as anyone who's watched Fox knows, its fundamental message is rage at what liberals are doing to our country. Over the years the specific message has changed with the times — from terrorism to open borders to Benghazi to Christian cake bakers to critical race theory — but it's always about what liberal politicians are doing to cripple America, usually with a large dose of thinly veiled racism to give it emotional heft...

The Fox pipeline is pretty simple. Fox News stokes a constant sense of outrage among its base of viewers, largely by highlighting narratives of white resentment and threats to Christianity. This in turn forces Republican politicians to follow suit. It's a positive feedback loop that has no obvious braking system, and it's already radicalized the conservative base so much that most Republicans literally believe that elections are being stolen and democracy is all but dead if they don't take extreme action."" - Unknown"

Instead, they behave like the neighborhood bullies, arrogantly believing they can get away with any abuses of their neighbors, because of our military support. We shouldnt make ourselves a partner in this.

Unfortunately, that's basically how their current nation was built - by pushing, bullying, & forcing their way into the region, with so many offences committed, doubtful anyone wants to play nice with them, now... They have left themselves with no choice, except to annihilate their enemies, or be annihilated, & that is exactly how they behave - like all the Palestinians must be annihilated, all their land taken, in order for Israel to exist, at all. That is a corner they backed themselves into - when they showed no willingness to show compassion to their fellow humans, or seek out peace, thru diplomacy - always resorting to brute force to achieve purely selfish ends, instead of cultivating peaceful relations, in a land they reside in, thanks only to the concessions others have made, on their behalf.

I give you little credit for the second bill and remember Pelosi does not have to bring it t the floor. I hope the Jewish population of the US finally sees the problem with the dems party."

2,"I'm aware on how effective the Iron Dome is. How it even benefits Palestinians. Still, I gotta ask...

How massive is the debt in Israel? Why is the USA funding the Iron Dome replenishment? Am I missing something, is funding some metaphor I'm unfamiliar with? I'd think Iron Dome is something important enough that Israel would fund it without handouts from Uncle Sam."
2,Pelosi AND THE SQUAD DID THIS .....all votes for this Bill...are vote to DESTROY Israel...every democrat or republican

1,These Anti-Americans need removed. But that’s what happens when you settle refugees to turn an election.
1,"""Liberals, progressives, Democrats and other rational thinkers must accept one crucial reality if they are to save America's democracy: Those who live in the right-wing echo chamber really do believe what they are being told. Those beliefs are now extensions of their core identities...

And as anyone who's watched Fox knows, its fundamental message is rage at what liberals are doing to our country. Over the years the specific message has changed with the times — from terrorism to open borders to Benghazi to Christian cake bakers to critical race theory — but it's always about what liberal politicians are doing to cripple America, usually with a large dose of thinly veiled racism to give it emotional heft...

The Fox pipeline is pretty simple. Fox News stokes a constant sense of outrage among its base of viewers, largely by highlighting narratives of white resentment and threats to Christianity. This in turn forces Republican politicians to follow suit. It's a positive feedback loop that has no obvious braking system, and it's already radicalized the conservative base so much that most Republicans literally believe that elections are being stolen and democracy is all but dead if they don't take extreme action."" - Unknown"

2,Less educated MAGA morons don’t wanna America contributing foreign aid so no aid to Israel.
1,Can't we just impeach that Cucking Funt?

2,"She and her ilk are abhorrent, Democrats just pulled funding from the Iron Dome—the missile defense system that has saved countless lives in Israel from Hamas' rocket attacks. While Democrats capitulate to the antisemitic influence of their radical members, Republicans will always stand with Israel."

1,"how these ""people"" got elected..I may never understand!! oh wait, maybe the same way Sleepy Joe did.. hmm that's an interesting theory..."
2,Yeah let's see if we could be a little more clueless Fox News. Maybe you missed the point where they said there was no point in funding it with the deficit cap bill because it's already part of a defense bill that's going to be passed later this year so there was no need to tack it on twice. Nobody said it's not getting funded it's just not going to be funded with this bill then with the other bill later when it's already been approved with the defense bill that going to be passed in December
1,The squad of four idiot enemies we allow in our government.
2,They want the Jewish people to die that's why. This is sick.
1,"1. You want us to quit aiding other countries, but you don't. We absolutely defend Israel with 3.8 billion already. They are the richest country in that region.
2. You want to talk about abandoning allies. Trump was the first and only U.S. President to abandon our allies on the field of battle, abandon a U.S. base and turn them both over to our arch enemy Russia, who rolled in the next day. Trump got no Kurds out of Syria, not one. The ISIS prisoners then released following this betrayal were quite likely some of the same ones who later planned the attack and killed 13 U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.
Wake up."
2,Terrible enemies from with in. Say goodbye to your American way of life.
1,"The jihadi snakes that hijacked the democratic party hate to see Israel defending themselves. During the last cycle of violence between Israel and Hamas, the jihadi terror organization had launched over 4000 UNGUIDED rockets on Israeli cities. Thankfully, the iron dome has prevented a total holocaust against the little Jewish state. In the next war, without the defense of iron dome Israel will be forced to take it's gloves off and respond propotionally to the threat in order to win the war and ensure the safety of it's people"

2,Israel can pay for his own defense program
2,"Raytheon produces the rockets used by the Iron Dome. That $1B goes to the defense contractor, who then starts production, keeping American citizens working. They fill the order and ship the product to Israel. The money doesn't actually leave the country. So, now they'll be unable to replenish the Iron Dome. Leaving the most important American ally defenseless like that is reprehensible"

2,We need to get money out of politics. It is a seriously corrupting influence. Our elected officials spend more time begging for money to finance their election campaigns than they do actually working for us.

1,Democrats in control of congress and not once have we heard anything about gutting Citizens United. I wonder why...hmmmm
2,She should be prosecuting for accepting bribes - - because that’s what it is.
0,"The closer to ""conservative"" politicians get, the easier they are to buy. Actually, all politicians spend way too much time ""fund raising"". We should really have publicly funded races, and laws that (when elected) politicians can't own stock, accept donations from anything other than individuals, and regulate lobbying. Government is supposed to work for the people, not the super rich and not for big corporations."
1,So why did Gov. Newsom divert money intended for Forrest management for something else? And why hasn't he addressed the water needs of the state? He doesn't know how to prepare ahead of time for these crisis.
2,This is why Insulinis $300 a pan in the United States. And $125 a pound overseas. Isn’t that awful patriotic of them . They said they sell it for a competitive price
2,"Both parties get paid by the same people. The reason most people vote for Democrats is that they are not Republicans. The reason most other people vote for Republicans is that they are not Democrats. The working class can not be allowed to win. That's why weren't allowed the opportunity to vote for Bernie Sanders and when we did, it was ignored. We are all left voting for the party we hate the least. You won't find the tools to gain your freedom in the master's house."
2,"When will we stop allowing our representatives

2,This is another heffer who should be removed from office.
2,This has to stop! Big Pharma is destabilizing the financial well being of the 98%! Our financial well being is at stake! As consumers we demand the ability to purchase RX drugs from reliable approved world market sources at reasonable prices like the rest of the planet!
1,"No one FORCES an ABORTION...but YOU want to FORCE a vaccine? My body, MY CHOICE...or isn't it!! Sit Down!!"
2,Probably because they would have to pay more in taxes.
2,"They make so when a lobbyist comes along offering them millions in perks, it's hard to say no. Our government has a pay structure well-suited to the 1970's, but now it's simply too far behind the scale of what these folks could make in the private sector. A lot of people think we pay our elected officials too much, but the problem is that we don't pay them enough to not take lobbyist money."
0,You're what I'd call a closet Republican.
2,Codify this law now!
0,"I read today the deficit was 7.8 trillion. When are the Democrats going to realize the Republicans are playing them. There is no intention of the republicans agreeing to anything for the present, they are looking at the future. You can see that in what Trump is doing by supporting all these people in state positions dealing with elections, if the the elections in the future is very close. Your dealing with some very nasty, corrupt individuals, that will stop at nothing, to cheat to win. An example is the last Supreme Court judge that shows how evil they are. Again they have cheated in the past when they didn't have the votes and changed it to 50 votes to win. You never trust Moscow Mitch McConnell and you should know that by now. You want to do something positive, start getting the people in the Republican Party with all the criminal activity they have done in the last plus decade. Get them removed from office and put in prison if possible. There supporters don't care how corrupt Trump and the Republicans are. The more corrupt they are the better they like it. You saw who supports them and the type of people they are. It's going to be interesting how hard the punishment will be for the people that were arrested for the insurrection, who was involved in the planning, and weapons that were used to murder the people that lost their life and the type of injuries that caused their wounds. The intent was to do bodily harm to anyone in their way of the attack."
2,"What happened to the billions we voted for and approved for new and expanded water storage??? Yeah,,,, didn't happen, did it!?"
2,Citizen’s United is just grand…. Until the people rein in the largess and dark money we will continue to see examples of corruption that they (politicians) continue to participate in
2,This is what taking bribes is all about. The US will never get better with grifters in positions of power.

0,In my opinion these people aren’t Dems… they’re wolves in sheep’s clothing. I’ve said for years that that’s how they will infiltrate the party and then work to dismantle from the inside. They’re no more trustworthy than the Russians or the Chinese. They know full well that they can’t win the public vote fair and square and cheating is their go to method now.
2,"So if they already took the bribes, does that mean they’re locked in and have to vote against the common good? Their constituents need to bombard them with messages to move them to do the right thing, or else."

0,"From a democratic CA constituent: RETIRE.
We have supported your ability to be in office longer than most. Your cognitive abilities are compromised, this is crazy. Diane do the NOBLE thing. It’s ridiculous to keep office as a procedural choice. You are not a true representation of what you used to be. Knowing Gavin Newsom won the recall election in stride - you could allow your Democratic replacement to have an opportunity to affect real change in our nation during this very critical time. While you can tend to your retirement and health needs."

0,"Sorry but there is no Constitutional right to abortion care. Our founding Fathers did not write that in the Constitutional.
But they did write the 2nd admendent to keep the goverment from taking our arms."
1,50 years ago we thought it was a blob. We know better now. It is inhumane butchery to abort a living feeling person that literally tries to get away from the blade. This is indefensible now that we know.

Shameful including the SCOTUS."

0,"We must realize Republicans give most of the money go their friends and cronies for their own use. They do not ever find necessities for people poorer then themselves. This Pandemic has definitely proved certain facts and having no money for the sick, the poor, the hungry, the homeless during the Republicans wrong in that when money has been given to individuals they have been spending it wisely for necessities rather than their being extravagant. They have been looking after their families, trying to pay for their housing despite climate change, Democrats show up for the people in need. They don't go on vacation , show up at the border, try to remedy during hurricanes, visit veterans try to help them out, try to pass infra structure bills so we get jobs, now you tell me what have we gotten from Republicans until this pass year? Unless we go to golf courses, baseball and football games, posh dinners,mostly,
we'll never know especially if it happens on the weekend.@"

1,"It's so hard to post controversial items on this senator's FB page. So I decided to INVADE and INTERRUPT this current string topic.Here's Gianna Jessen, (link) a rare survivor of this moral ABOMINATION that your senator championed when voting AGAINST Senate Bill 311: If it had passed, it would have protected the sometimes FULL-TERM survivors of infanticide abortions; abortions which are done WITHOUT anesthesia for the infant. If you read your senator's FB page, then you need to know about/"
2,These 'donations' are nothing but bribes and should be totally illegal.

Politicians are supported by rich people, politicians are supporting them.
They won't support the average american until we provide a better method of support than rich people do"

2,You're not even a real Republican

Our safeguards against graft are nonexistent ."
2,These members of our government are accepting Bribes which is a criminal offense. This is illegal no matter what you call it. 😡
2,You are not serving any of your constituents from any party at all if you aren’t at least working to find reasonable solutions in these areas.
2,Because they will be taxed too
2,"You have been FACT checked and found 100% FALSE. A supreme ct ruling is NOT ""settled law."" ONLY congress -- with the consent of the governed -- can make law if the SC makes setteld law then ""Plessy v Ferguson,"" ""Dred Scott v. Sanford,"" ""Korematsu v. United States,"" would still be law

Diane you're a DOPE."

1,Lol at democrats concerned over the debt
2,And now the billionaires are trying to make a 5th branch of army called space something. Give me a break. Let’s get things taken care of here first.
2,"That sounds like bribery, pure and simple, to me. How it can be legal is beyond me. It's like if a big company, pharma or oil company, were going to be judged in court and were slipping the judge large sums of money before hand. Actually mind boggling that no bill has been introduced to end. Could it be so many are accepting payola that no one wants to see it end."
2,These politicians need to be primary and taken out of Government.
2,Some of y’all need to learn what “debt” truly means. (Hint:it’s not good. Republicans and Democrats are the same when it comes to spending our money like there’s no tomorrow.)

2,"Can we stop pretending that any democrats are anything other than ""moderates"""
0,This is why Sinema votes against everything the Democrats try to pass. This is also why she and Manchin vote against getting rid of the filibuster... They care less about America and change. They should both be Republicans because they follow McConnell's lead. Getting rid of the filibuster is the only way to make change in the voting rights.
2,remember the supreme court said it was ok for corporations to donate as much money as they wanted...the long game is coming to fruit
2,We just got our tax return this week
2,"Surprise, surprise….our very own Congress has been bought by corporate America! Wonder how long this has been going on?"
2,"We need to reverse Citizens United, and cap corporate donations to sitting politicians."
1,Because Democrats are massive rich and hypocrites...
0,"Seems to me that is because they are demonized for it by the republicans. The Republicans always convinced people that Democrats are not just taxing the rich, but that they will be taxing lower incomes also. It seems to work every time."
2,"Dianne..comment

2,Debt ceiling just authorizez expwnditures that have already been made and not the new budget!
2,Omg how can this still be legal.
0,"And you just stated the reason why we need to look at abortion differently....
50 years ago!!!!
We as women should have total control of our bodies and that includes using your brains.
We have SO many birth control options now and morning after pills.

2,Does not matter what party they are in it’s always been about the dam money they should refuse it from the backs of poor people who have to make the choice of medicine or food god dam politicians are all the same.
1,"Raising the debt limit authorizes Treasury (or is it the Federal Reserve Bank? hell if I know) to run the dollar bill printing press an hour more. If Democrats were serious about defending the dollar (and they ain't even serious about defending the cost of tea in China), they'd be cutting income tax rates (causing money to move out of tax-shelters) and taxing the royal dickens out of crude oil instead."
2,Bought and paid for by Big Pharma!
1,The right to bear arms was decided during the founding of this great country and Democrats still wanna change that.
2,If you vote against these things your a Moran

0,Can you send me an extra $2000 Dianne? Asking for the Democrats in this state...
2,Dems and Reps getting money from pharma must be voted out.
2,And start with the anti-democracy folks attending Davos and corrupting the world.
2,What we need to do is outlaw lobbyists!
2,Big Money owns us. Corporations should not be able to contribute to campaigns and there should be a cap on what individuals can contribute.
2,"So much greed, so much selfishness in the land......God is not pleased...Yes, you are right! You are rich in money and material things, but who are you? Just because you are rich and BIG that makes you powerful? Do you know that same hole that the poor are buried in, the rich have to live in that same hole!!!! The hold you will live your eternal life in, it is not lined with gold and silver and all your precious stones, houses, camps, boats, 3 wheelers and 4 wheelers and your big boats!!! no no, they are not. They are lined with mud and dirt, like everyone else......rotti
ng and going back in the dirt. You will not have to worry if someone will rob you at that moment, because everything in your hole will ROT.....What will you be able to show for it then? You said your kids and family would get it.....AND!!!! You will not see it! You will not come back and pull on their toes if they don't do it like you said......You will be DEAD! Gone and not returning......
.Just remember how greedy you are and your selfishness of the things that God has allowed you to own and have......How your greed and selfishness has set you apart from the love of God's Children. How those material things have divided the world, that you may claim you are living in your own world...wrong!!
! The world you living in belongs to God, not your.....You did not create it and you cannot keep it.......How rich are you and how you feel at the end of the day with you greed? Do you know what love is? Have you ever experience the love of the Lord in your life, your kids lives, your wife's life, your family? The love of money is the root of all evil.....What do you plan to do with the wealth that God has entrusted you with? Do you plan to share it with people in the love of God or your love? Because if it is not the love of God, that love is fake and a lie. Choose this day whom you will serve, the God of the wealth and famous or Jehovah God? Foe me, whether what I have, I will serve My Jehovah God with everything. How about you?

2,It's amazing how lobbyists can buy votes but its illegal for everyone else. Congress shouldn't be able to recieve anything from any organization while in office. We never seem to get what and who we actually vote for.
2,"the federal debt ceiling is like your family budget debt ceiling. You can set any maximum you like and stick to it with some effort, but if your kid breaks his back and requires surgery, you'll damed sure raise that arbitrary limit to cover the monumental copays"

2,"Vote no on the continuing resolution and debt ceiling, infrastructure bills we can't afford this anymore"
2,These politicians are all motivated by money and their own greed. We have to get rid of them with honest people who truly want to help the American people.

2,I'm so sick of these lying back stabbing hypocrites who are only focused on greed.
0,"All of these Pharma-owned so-called Democrats have a whole lot to answer for! It's high time that Congress enact laws that prevent and penalize members who attempt to profit from lobbyists while at the same time earning salaries as US Representatives
. The conflict of interest is glaringly absurd. It's time for the Biden Administration to enact laws that forbid any elected Congress person from receiving any form of compensation outside of the salary provided by virtue of their service (yeah, right) as an elected official. This bullshit has got to be stopped."
0,"The republicans started this with Reagan, and they've been adding to it ever since. But only for wars and military spending. Never anything the AMERICAN people need, Only what your campaign donors order you to support."

2,That's sad they don't understand that will probably be voted out after the shenanigans
2,In 1957 the top tax rate was 90%...and the Rockefellers lived with it...the wealthy have bought out the middle class for pennies...it is disgusting...
2,"Her vote can be bought, so of course they did."
2,Another politician bought and paid for.
2,"again, i will state that taxing unrealized capital gains needs to be OFF THE TABLE. imagine that you were taxed on 10 million dollars of stock holdings. and then your stocks crashed. (stock prices vary between infinity and zero). so you could be taxed on worthless paper. how is that fair? a progressive value added tax on high dollar spending makes much more sense."
2,That's American politics for ya.
1,Don’t forget Cory Booker who has also received money from big Pharma.
1,This is inhumane to kill a living human no matter what size it is.
2,Have you told them that this is just an early tax refund payment lol
1,Why Democrats? Why?

2,"Bought off by election contributions..
. both dems and Republicans and now party of trumpers."
1,"Why is it greed to keep what you've earned? Why isn't it greed to take from someone beyond what is taxable. If you want to say that people cheat the government out of taxes ask yourself; who creates loopholes in the tax code?
Term Limits for Congress!"
2,Because most House Democrats are like House Republicans. They're insanely rich. The ones that aren't are bought and paid for by the rich.

2,Can we the people pool our money and buy some of our own politicians?
2,"Let’s be clear, the term “lobbying” is basically paying off government officials to pass a bill that is in favor of the company’s wants. So it really should be called “bribing” since let’s be honest, it is a bribe. That’s a conflict of interest and also illegal. Worst part is you can’t hold these people accountable because they make the rules and break them. The system is rigged and broken. But nothing will ever change. Ever. That’s the real world we live in. A very sad world."
2,OF COURSE they did. Why do you think she is stopping all Biden's agenda?
