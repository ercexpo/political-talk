2,"Thank you. So important to not let our like of other aspects of a person (policies, etc.) prevent us from holding them accountable to harms they‚Äôve caused."
2,"Although I agree Gov. Cuomo's behavior seemed inappropriate at times & probably is best if he stepped down, don't think of the accounts I've heard that anything was criminal or against the law. Maybe he will find some other work as he seems like a very decent man. Hoping the new governor Kathy Hochul will do good for the great state of New York."
0,"They elected a man who said he grabbed them by the p***y‚Ä¶.yeah, we have a long way to go."
2,I still say he made trump look bad during the first Covid and he's getting payback. I notice that women always believe women. I'm not convinced this time. I think she's (the one all over tv) is collecting a big paycheck. Just my humble opinion.
0,"Well said, the ""lack of transparency"", there is nothing worse than to be blindsided by a system that you trust. It should be a 2 way window with our government and it's; our officials, that we as citizens have elected to speak our voice, on our terms, our agreed terms as citizens. Thank you for your efforts, AOC all the way!"
0,Cuomo - give me a break - the line has moved! Only for you. We women have stood strong for so long along a line that you determined fit your needs. Your line is leading you out the door of the Governor‚Äôs mansion and office!!
2,We should also not elect abusers to become president
0,"Trump should have resigned also. Yet his supporters, wealthy white men could not let that happen. Side note, I am truly sorry for the abuse you are enduring from those around you. I bless the path you are on, and admire your perseverance in the face of assault. Be safe. Your life is too precious."
2,"Sometimes people don‚Äôt tell the truth, and that‚Äôs okay to admit as well. This abuser vs. abused binary is divisive and leaves 0 room for nuance. Sometimes trauma makes us believe something is happening that isn‚Äôt actually happening. That‚Äôs called psychic equivalence, and it‚Äôs a real thing, and it is not victim-blaming.
And no, that‚Äôs not the case all the time, but it does happen ‚Ä¶ a lot. We are entirely abandoning reality with these victim axioms as if there is no way on earth that there‚Äôs another side to things. THAT is just as well the first step toward totalitarianism
."
0,"I was so worried about how you would handle this. Need to clarify that you have no real responsibility to be vocal about business that‚Äôs not your own however as a political (really in career only‚Ä¶. And I mean that as a compliment) you have been and frequently do voice yourself opinions‚Ä¶. A lot, if not all, are not lunacy and I agree with. But as a fellow Democrat I worried you would stay silent, thank you for being unbiased by party. You are a shining example of how to be a public servant"
0,"And people wonder why victims don‚Äôt report right away. The response is so often that they are lying, don‚Äôt know how social interaction works, or were asking for the abuse. Can we stop allowing these powerful men to defend themselves on national television in this pathetic and manipulative way?"
2,"Biden said Cuomo did a hell of a job, except personally. There's the way Cuomo governed and another way he acted in a purely personal capacity that had nothing to do with being governor. And ""Our American Cousin"" was a hell of a play and a fine presentation by Ford's theater until John Wilkes Booth interrupted it halfway through. Patrons never even got their money back. And that's what's so sad, as Biden noted."
0,How about trump and Gaetz and Kavanaugh? Why are they not held accountable!?
1,We live in a hypocritical society where we rant against the police for treating certain POC as being guilty before facing justice of his or her peers in the court of law.. Are all not innocent until proven guilty in a court of law?
2,"Very well said. You are a true hero, not only to the district you represent, but also for all people that deserve better. We need more like you in our government. Get it, Queen."
0,"I agree fully, but why are only Democrats held accountable for their actions?"
0,Thank you. The sexual violence and abuse by powerful men can no longer be ignored.
0,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unrelated I know.
I‚Äôm from the UK and haven‚Äôt heard any official speak about what‚Äôs happening with Line 3.

A treaty is currently being broken, US law enforcement paid by the Canadian oil company for man power.
The indigenous need help along with many endangered species that rely on that water."
0,Well he is guilty like the former Orange Man female genitalia grabber. And all those who cover for them are abuser too.
0,"For every courageous women who refuse to be abused in silence there are multiples who still live in fear and suffering, they must feel safe to come forward, also there must be sever consequences for those who help the harasser cover up"
0,"I'm still waiting for the media and democrats to pressure Congressman Matt Gaetz to do the same and also legally force Trump's hand to submit his DNA in a possible rape case. Cuomo resigning is a win, and his replacement looks very promising comparably, but we need to pressure the other side of the aisle enough to get similar results."
0,"I love this. As a fellow Democrat I'm glad he resigned but am disappointed he seemed to feel no remorse, and took no blame. We have to be the party to take the higher ground, because we know they never will."
0,"I‚Äôm in awe of how AOC (or the person who runs her account) can articulate the modern complexities of civil rights. I do wish he was around to progress the Trump cases,I‚Äôm hoping it gets done with the same fortitude."
2,I don‚Äôt agree he should not have resigned. He was good for the state and got things done. This is the first time I have ever disagreed with AOC.
1,"Once again, the Democrats eat their young while Republicans revel in delight. I wonder how we'll all feel when a Republican wins the governorship and Trump gets a NY pardon."
2,Agreed. I was disappointed in his statement about the line being ‚Äúredrawn‚Äù. It‚Äôs a face saving excuse and he needs to drop that and admit he knew he could flex his power over women because he‚Äôs been the governor. We need truth.
2,"Totalitarianism
doesn‚Äôt work without the introduction of delusional psychosis.
Also, narcissism."
0,"Thank you AOC, for helping blow the dust and cobwebs off institutions of power that have operated in the shadows for too long. Your courage is contagious and very much needed right now. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
0,"I agree with everything you said. But I am getting tired of the Dems always being the ones to stand up and take their own out for this type of BS behavior, while the GOP ignore it and let it continue and refuse to do the same with their own. We need to force them to do the same!"
2,We won‚Äôt forget how you forced Cuomo out with zero due process. Absolutely shameful. You will never hold higher office.
2,You need to recommrnd to your supporters what preferences to give for Mayor
0,AOC for president i love you Alexandria.

2,How convenient. A list of people I won't vote for. Thanks Alex.
1,"Anybody else notice that Dems have been running America‚Äôs cities and inner cities for 3-4 generations and havent fixed them yet? As a matter of fact they continue to get worse‚Ä¶worse schools, more homelessness, more crime, etc. Yet Dems want you to believe they have more, new ideas that will fix the mess they created. So isn‚Äôt voting D like the definition of insanity?"

2,"I always liked Maya Wiley when she was guest on MSNBC. However, I never thought she was as RADICAL as Bernie and his squad. Hope, a more moderate wins!!"
2,Coming from a person who can't even take care of her own grandmother the poor lady lives in poverty well AFC lives in luxury how sad is that
2,I remember last year how you helped Ed Markey get reelected to the Senate and saw you on TV with my Congressman Seth Moulton this morning.
0,i love AOC...perhaps the most anti-American congresswoman in the U.S. Bella Abzug would whip her butt for all the bad things she says about the nation. I hope she gives up riding in a car or flying in a jet between DC and NYC. She should walk her way into the Green New Feel! AOC for Prez. The end of the National Socialist Democratic Party along with her.

2,Our country is in a violence crisis and we need to do something about it.
2,"Even if it was an ""accident,"" anyone in almost any other profession who ""accidentally"" kills someone would face severe consequences."
2,How about some personal accountability for the people that are breaking the law and putting themselves into this
2,"Please don‚Äôt continue to support the very system your party now has ostensible power over. The drones, the detentions, the platitudes about common ground with those without human compassion or decency. You were one of the few who gave average people hope. Don‚Äôt be Fredo I beg of you. Don‚Äôt break our hearts."
2,"Pouring gas on a fire. Investigation barely even begun. You're part of the problem, you're helping grow a ""guilty until Proven Innocent"" society. Unless it meets your agenda of course.
Shame on you."
2,"I am angry and appalled at the recent events involving police and deaths of young black men. With that out of the way,I am the mother of a hard working, caring, good police officer who puts his life in danger on a very consistent basis. While those that do wrong should without a doubt be punished, let's not forget that there are more good cops than bad ones. Recruitment of police officers in this day and age is a challenge and it doesn't help that they are not paid enough for what they do either. Just remember to judge the individual for their actions and not every cop on the beat. I sincerely hope to see change to make everyone safer"
2,It‚Äôs a tragic incident for all parties involved.. so sad he had to resist and cause the escalation.
1,Way to incite violence Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A mistake that cost someone their life and was admitted to by the cop. End of story.
0,It is always right to criticize law enforcement in the United States. People think it's a crime -- especially after -- but it's a right.
0,"I heard a report today that none of the Brooklyn Center police force actually live in the community. If this is true, this is also a problem. A community's police department should reflect the community in which they protect and serve. This won't solve everything, but if the police are of the people of their community, they may have a different level of investment in its people. And more good police need to call out bad police."
2,"Question is , what are you politicians doing about it , or do you prefer to talk just enough to get re-elected? Do what they need you to do instead of saying it if you really want to make a difference! Once election season come around we the people Hear and watch nothing but promises and no action !"
1,"At the same time why not educate the ppl not to flee and obey the officers orders, in most cases at the max you would be arrested, warned or cited for wrong doing. But if you have a warrant ofcourse they arrest you. Obeying officers orders was one of things I was taught by my seniors when I arrived into US into 2006. Hope the young and vulnerable learn a lesson in addition to better training and rules for the officers to bring a positive change in the society. Bashing each other and politicizing the issue will only make mattes worse. Side note that kid at 20 should be in college not parenting a 2yr old boy, thats a broader problem this cntry has to address."
1,Just another reminder that it‚Äôs a dangerous profession being a criminal and resisting arrest. Let‚Äôs hold the criminals as accountable as we all want police to be.
1,"It was an unfortunate accident. At the end of the day the main lesson that should be learned from all of these unfortunate events is, ( stop resisting arrest). It will never end well. You fight the arrest in court, not on the street. Stop pointing the finger and take some personal accountability.
If you really want to lead Ms. Cortez, then this should be your message. I know you have good intentions, but you're going at this from the wrong direction."
2,"Your comments are not based on on emotion and presumption. The facts in this case do not support your assertions.This is very irresponsible behavior from a public figure and I would expect that people in positions of power and influence would feel the need to hold themselves to a higher standard. Great leaders seek the facts and stand up for what is right even when it is not popular. They bring people together, they don't divide and instigate."
2,His mistake costs him his life. Her mistake gets her early retirement with a pension and a chance to double dip with another police dept.
2,Or.. It was a criminal with a warrant resisting arrest who unfortunately was shot during a tragic
2,"The actual investigation has barely started. She admitted her mistake verbally on body cam. She resigned, she will be going to court. Ppl so negative b4 anything has even happened."
0,"The real way to end this type of crap is:
- Remove qualified immunity.
- Require ALL officers to carry $1M in malpractice insurance just like doctors and lawyers.
- Tie civil awards to the police retirement fund. Example: If there is a $3M award for misconduct $1M comes from the officer's insurance and the $2M comes from the retirement fund and NOT the tax payers.
- Create a national database of discredited officers (just like they do with lawyers and doctors) so if they apply for another law enforcement position their past WILL follow them."
2,How about people comply with the officers orders. Do not resist
0,"Excuse me for saying so, but it seems a bit odd that a woman who has been a police officer for 26yrs would 'mistakenly' draw her gun thinking it was her taser, if she doesn't know the difference between the two after 26yrs then she shouldn't be a cop at all and she sure as hell shouldn't be excused, or forgiven, for making such a stupid, not to mention fatal, rookie mistake..."
2,She should not be allowed to keep her pension!
0,how does a 25 year veteran not know the difference between a GUN and a Taser? O r better still how do they not know that the punishment for expired tags or misdemeanors is still NOT DEATH.
1,"...says the socialist who wants to increase state violence, authority, and spending."
2,Definitely a tragedy and avoidable. Maybe not run from the cops also. That might help
0,"The reason the cops pulled Daunte Wright over: He had an air freshener dangling from his mirror which was supposedly blocking his view.

I feel like that part of the story doesn‚Äôt get enough attention. Really makes you wonder if they were just looking for a reason to pull people over."
0,"Let‚Äôs not forget the mass proliferation of guns among USA citizens...so that police fear being killed with every racially profiled pull over. You can thank the misinterpretati
on of the second amendment and the NRA for that."
2,Time to end qualified immunity.
1,Tip of the day: Don‚Äôt fight with the police if you don‚Äôt want to get shot.
2,"When our grandchildrens grandchildren won't be able to pay back what we spent, it's too much. Especially when the entity responsible for ""fixing the problem"" is well known for its past great successes like the war on drugs, the war on terror, the war on poverty, etc."
2,Funny they never say it's too much when waging war.
2,Too much is when you decimate the American economy and send manufacturing jobs overseas only to create even worse pollution on the other side of the earth. Too much is when the government spends seniors SS money on programs to create more dependent voters. Too much is when govt overregulates businesses including child care facilities so much that they need a lawyer in house to navigate those laws/ regulations.
0,Bernie is not radical. He's just a honest to god democrat. The corporate lobbies just hate the truth. What made america great was a strong middle class not a handful of billionaires. Reasonable people need to vote. Not just the clowns.

And hey I've invented a new antidepressant anti-anxiety antipsychotic

an ability to buy food and think clearly,
a fondness for red flags,

And hey I think we just might make it,

2,"Bernie Sanders
Are you ready for a radical statement? I happen to think that Joe Manchin is right. Yeah, physical infrastructure is terribly important. But I happen to think that the needs of the human beings of our country ‚Äî working families, the children, the elderly, the poor ‚Äî are even more important, and we can and must do both.
Look, everybody in America ‚Äî whether you're Republican, Democrat or independent ‚Äî understands that, for the last many years, the very richest people in this country and the largest corporations have done phenomenally well, while the working class and the middle class of this country struggle, and we have got close to 600,000 people sleeping out on the streets.

Elderly people in America can't afford to put dentures into their mouth. They have no teeth in their mouth in some cases, can't afford hearing aids, can't afford eyeglasses. Working families cannot afford child care for their kids. Young people cannot afford to go to college.

And then on top of all of that, the scientific community is telling us that we're looking at a cataclysmic crisis in terms of climate. Oregon is burning. California is burning.

People are drowning in New York City. Detroit is flooding. Siberia has seen the largest fire on Earth. Drought is happening in places all over the world.

The United States must lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel. This is a crisis we are living in.

So, what polling tells us is that working families all over this country understand that NOW is the time for Congress to address the long neglected problems facing working families. Now is the time to have the wealthy and large corporations -- we've got billionaires in this country who don't pay a nickel in federal income tax.
So, I think we can do all of this. We can do the physical infrastructure.
We can do the reconciliation bill, create millions of good jobs, and finally tell the American people that we are going to stand up for working families ‚Äî not just the rich and the powerful. Let's get it done.

Reminder: The actual cost of the Build Back Better Act is not $3.5 trillion, it's $0. The funding working families need is going to be paid for by taxing the wealthiest and corporations."

To consume a thing, is to extinguish a thing.

2,"Bernie ur great, but u been saying the same stuff for years, & nothing been done.

So here's a NEW IDEA.
Can u & ur colleagues start referring to health insurance has a SOCIALIST CONCEPT, and belongs in a SOCIALIST MODEL.

Just saying it's a human right is fine, but that doesn't move the needle to much. U have to get ppl to see the logic, and change their minds. And u can do that better, by exposing the health insurance companies by doing the messaging this way.

How do health insurance companies make money?

They collect premiums r deny ppl coverage. THAT'S IT! And if u think about that, what is that, that's a SOCIALIST CONCEPT. If the CEO of XYZ insurance company is not happy making $5 million a year, they want to make 50 millon a year, what do they have to do, r the only thing they can do, is raise PREMIUMS r DENY ppl coverage. THAT'S IT. That's a socialist CONCEPT & belongs in a socialist MODEL. If u put a SOCIALIST concept into a CAPITALIST model, it will butt heads. It will not be as efficient r effective. And that's what we have now. And vice verse, u don't want a CAPITALIST concept in a SOCIALIST model. Otherwise, we'll all be waiting hours in line for stale bread. It's not like the CEO of walmart, if they want to make more money, they have to sell more, r be more efficient in their operations.Thus
, CAPITALIST CONCEPT, belongs in CAPITALIST MODEL. Same goes for health insurance companies. It's a SOCIALIST CONCEPT, & belongs in a SOCIALIST MODEL. Bcuz all they can do to make more money is raise premiums & deny ppl coverage. And that puts the squeeze on patients & doctors.

If u do the messaging this way, this will move the needle more to universal health insurance, bcuz ppl will see the truth & logic. Instead of just saying it's a human right, which it is, but to get more ppl to believe in universal health insurance, u need to do the messaging this way. A socialist CONCEPT belongs in a socialist MODEL. At minimum it should be non-profit.

I have some good ideas how to make to get this point across. And I'm sure, if u start this messaging, it will get done. Start beating the Republicans at their own game."

,"Immigrants and refugees are on the rise throughout Latin America. The background is the natural disasters and political instability that occurred in neighboring poor countries, and the economic difficulties caused by the spread of the new coronavirus. Many immigrants and refugees will eventually head for the United States, which can be a challenge for the Biden administration.
In late August, a large number of immigrants from Haiti, a Caribbean island nation, flooded in front of the Office of the National Migration Agency in Tapachula, Chiapas, a town near the southern border of Mexico. ""Mexico, Panama and Colombia already have immigrants from Haiti and will continue to grow,"" one of them told local media. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the region. Haiti was on the way to recovery from the 2010 earthquake, which killed more than 300,000 people, and another magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck on August 14. Many homes were destroyed in Haiti, killing more than 2,200 people. In July, the incumbent President Jovenel Mo√Øse was assassinated in Haiti. In Haiti, as security deteriorates, it is likely that more and more people will want to leave the country. The Colombian and Panama governments have agreed to deepen office-level collaboration and help increase immigrants from Haiti. Immigrants from Nicaragua are rushing to Costa Rica in Central America. According to Nicaragua's local newspaper, La Prensa, the number of Nicaraguan immigrants reached 5699 in July, nearly four times the number in May (1485). Nicaragua is preparing for the presidential election in November this year. The anti-American leftist Daniel Ortega administration is strengthening its stance of power, such as detaining the opposition presidential candidates one after another, and more and more people are seeking a place to go abroad. To date, Venezuela has become the largest ‚Äúsending country‚Äù for migrants and refugees in Latin America. Venezuela is one of the leading oil-producing countries in Latin America, but the failure of the anti-American leftist government has caused security problems and food shortages, and about 3.9 million people have fled the country. Refugees from Venezuela are the second largest number in the world after long-standing conflict in Syria in the Middle East. In many cases, Latin American immigrants once head to neighboring countries in the region and then eventually head to the United States. The number of immigrants detained in July on the southwestern border of the United States was 212,672. The US media reports that it is the highest in the last 21 years. Today, the southern border of the United States is often illegally crossed from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico in Central America. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), more than 18.35 million people are being displaced in Latin America by the end of 2020. This number accounts for about 20% of the world total (about 82.4 million people). While the world is focused on increasing refugees from Afghanistan, where the Islamist Taliban came to power, Latin American migrants and refugees are also a major issue.

1,"Russia is about to make a killing and they have Joe Biden to thank for it. After he cancelled the Keystone Pipeline, he then lifted all sanctions on the Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline that runs from Russia to Germany. They will soon be able to sell their excess gas to Europe at a time when gas prices have increased 250%.
During the Trump administration,
we achieved energy independence and we were selling the surplus overseas. Joe Biden has drug us back to the dependency on foreign oil, where we buy oil from countries that hate us. Gasoline prices in the United States have increased by about 50%."
2,"Total Big 6 pharma profits: 50 Billion dollars.

Union pension bailout: 86 Billion dollars.

Now who is bribing whom to get a pension bailout on the taxpayers back greater than the total profits of the 6 largest pharma companies Bernie?"
1,Why isnt congress doing more to cap campaign contributions? Why are you allowing congress to be bribed? Why arent you furious that Biden froze the legislation to reduce costs?
1,"Bernie, you're a rich, fear-mongering tool. Most of what you post is lies. America will never be a communist country, no matter how hard you try. Now, how about you open up your 3 homes to illegals and the homeless??"
2,"There is no ""market"" for pharmaceuticals

1,What about big pharmas power and money grab through the use of vaccine passports and their attack on democracy. Are you going to tackle them on that issue Bernie?
2,"The fact that HCQ and Ivermectin were taken off market is proof that the Covid measures taken by governments and the medical extorsion racket are crimminal.

Ivermectin is on the WHO list of essential medicines for human beings and was always an easy, inexpensive, and most important very effective treatment for Covid and which leads the patient to natural immunity.

At this point and with our knowledge, any doctor or hospital who does not prescribe Ivermectin for Covid is an egregious crimminal fraud and murderer.

Ivermectin would have spared 80% of deaths and hospitalization
s.

But using Ivermectin would have ruined the for-profit gravy train of these psychopath medical industry and government murderers.

2,"In Australia I had gestational diabetes 2 years ago, I was given 6 x boxes of Novorapid insulin pens (5 in a box so 30 insulin cartridges) for a grand total of $40 for the lot. I had so much left over when the diabetes went away because my baby was born. I just gave it back to the pharmacy for safe disposal as it‚Äôs so cheap here no one is in need of it. I did think it was such a sad situation as there are so many actually dying in America because they need it and I couldn‚Äôt even give it away, it just went in a pharmacy disposal bin"
2,"I just paid over $900 for a life changing migraine medicine because I hit a medication cap that I didn't know existed on my fairly good insurance plan. I picked it up because I can't fathom going back to having a migraine almost every day, but I don't know how I'm going to keep paying for it."
2,"Every single citizen in the United States does nothing but play a game of chicken with their medical concerns on a daily basis.

If someone‚Äôs going to steal my hard earned money in the form of taxes, making sure that I have medical support when needed is the one and only thing that I would say that it‚Äôs justified for."
2,"Let‚Äôs go into drugs that you can‚Äôt even get, at any price, in the us."
2,Everything in Michigan is triple! From meds to one of the highest auto insurance rates in the country! It sucks over here
2,Insulin is free in Ireland. You are not punished for having a long term condition.
2,"If only the wealthy can afford the necessary drugs to stay alive, that pretty much tells us all we need to know about our nation' leaders!!!!"
2,This is certainly one thing we agree on. It‚Äôs upsetting. My heart goes out to those who rely on critical medication. As a veteran.. I‚Äôve had my own unfavorable experiences with our system.
2,"I say we don't negotiate. We tell them the price or they don't get another dime in ""research, development or testing"" funding, no tax breaks either. Tired of our tax dollars funding private business. Our entire healthcare system is peppered with greed and corruption."
2,Insulin is cheaper if you bypass your insurance and use a prescription card.
2,"Please fix this issue, and healthcare in general. I for one have lost everything I own due to cancer diagnosis. I have a cost of almost $1,000,000 for treatments in less than 2 years.

You should have to sacrifice quality of life for quantity"
2,Change to keto diet and you can lower your insulin dose completely. See the science.
2,"Most people don't understand the outrageously high cost of medical care & pharmaceuticals
until they're in that boat."
2,"Here is how I think it works: greedy rich hire lawyers, lawyers bribe judges and legislators, judges and legislators pass or block bills or amendments to get more money for greedy rich. I would like to put all four of them in prison.
Next, vote in new Judges and Legislators.
Next, repeat till we get better Judges and Legislators that are not taking bribery anymore."
2,"Make the other countries pay more so ours isn't so outrageously high.

Not all of that money goes to profits.

R&D, manufacturing, distribution...
."
2,Good luck with it ! Most politicians are getting kickbacks from them!!
2,Then Bernie how bout you get all the ass holes in Congress and the senate and the POTUS to stop taking money from big pharmaceutical companies! Then they will have no power and you may actually pass something against that. Until then nothing changes
2,Imagine my shock today when my senior friend was quoted $4k for hearing aids that he desperately needs! We Can Do Better!!!! Seniors need help!
2,I have been behind elderly who leave their prescriptions at the pharmacy counter because they can‚Äôt afford to pay. This needs fixed.
2,Do you think the mafia could just buy Canadian insulin in bulk at $12 a shot then smuggle into the U.S. and sell for I don't know $22? I'm just saying it would be a good scheme and I'm pretty sure it would be legal
2,"Good luck with that. The pharma companies have your boss and pretty much all of your colleagues on both sides of aisle in their back pocket, as well as the FDA."
2,"The system is so chronic. Wealthiest country in the world, producing own vaccine, but voters allowed to be ripped off. The vaccine costs less than half in other countries who imported the same vaccine."
2,Thank heaven for our PBS and Medicare in Australia. Making huge profits from sick people is cowardly.
2,Wait.... so the vaccines have nothing to do with the *greed* of the pharmaceutical industry... Right... got it. Stay consistent Bernie!!
2,"Why are the lawmakers so susceptible to m the lobbies, I wish lobbies weren't permitted. Especially since they have had detrimental effects on the public, ( i.e. big Parma, NRA, Tobacco, Auto industry, to name just a few). It amounts to greed by lawmakers."
2,"We should add, manufactured and then shipped from what country. USA üá∫üá≤. Pathetic we charge our own citizens more."
2,Heard you today on tv...I can tell your fed up of the GOP alright...they are on their own side...I work with one and he is the most callus person I have ever met. Sad he would sell his best friend on his death bed if he could while claiming he is a Christian
2,It feels like we have lost. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. The vast majority of all US citizens that go into the field of medicine do it for the money and NOT to help people or better themselves. All patients are commodities to be exploited especially the dying - maximum profit!
2,Open the border for Canadians to come to the US ! Canada has over 70 % double vaccination rate ! What is the hold up ? I haven't seen my family in over 21 month & they live only one hour over the border. Why can people fly but not drive to the US.

2,We‚Äôre tired of paying American politicians the highest price on the planet. It‚Äôs probably why insulin prices are the highest. Makes sense huh?
2,"The difference is our 700 military bases around the planet. You know, ""for keeping us safe."""
0,"How about including everyone who pays into Medicare through payroll deductions already, in the Medicare program, regardless of age?
How much does a Medicare patient pay for insulin today?"
0,Also need dental and eye coverage for seniors. Why retire and loose two costly benwfits
2,I‚Äôm sick and tired of people being sick and tired. I‚Äôm tired of people needing insulin in the first place. The cost of the drugs isn‚Äôt the problem! The fact that so many need them is the problem. Why are so many Americans sick? That‚Äôs what people need to focus on!
0,"Yes, we need medical for all, apply 2% extra tax for medical below 65."
2,I agree this is a problem. But very few people use insulin in a vial these days. Let's talk about insulin pens and get up to speed. Or perhaps compare the average cost for 1 month's supply of insulin.
0,"Absolutely terrible the way we are charged for drugs. That should be number one for Congress, but hey, they don‚Äôt care about us and they have GREAT medical coverage. Maybe make them have what we do and have to actually pay for it and just maybe there will be a change. Seems like only Bernie is fighting for us. Keep it up Bernie maybe some day we will win."
2,"Paying $12 for life saving medicine should be something everyonr demands, regardless of party. It's ridiculous to let greedy pharmacy companies to have control over life saving meds or any meds for that matter. My wish is to see companies that exploited and caused the of people made to pay restitution. Hey,its better than tarred and feathered...whi
ch would include politicians who support greed companies."
2,"Absolutely. It‚Äôs K Street that‚Äôs responsible for this, and, of course, the politicians they bribe. We should make bribes to politicians illegal."
2,"And for those of us who choose healthy nutritional alternatives, such as juice that has kept my brain tumor from growing for 14 years that I have to pay $153 out of pocket instead of it's being paid for along with my vitamins and supplements which would be paid for in the Canadian system, and hopefully in Medicare for all. Please, please call Congress 202-224-3121 insist they bring medicare-for-al
l Bill to a vote now! With it covering Vision, Dental, mental health and long-term care"
2,hope it doesnt sound like gloating( im not) but vaccines are free in the uk ( as is all health care)... save the NHS...it wasnt given but hard fought for against the establishment of the time 1948...
2,"We‚Äôve been hearing this problem for years‚Ä¶. No one cares. Congress has so many other things more important to do than these drugs prices‚Ä¶ like fighting over masks, abortion rights, how to take back control of the Congress next year blah blah blah‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs all they care ‚Ä¶ Forget it, we are on our own‚Ä¶"
2,Also insulin is usually free in Canada if you have supplemental insurance.
2,"That's the cost of pharmaceuticals
paying politicians. We are the ones paying for the corruption."
2,Our health care system is probably one of the best examples of how warped the definition of freedom is in the United States.
2,It is my understanding if implemented the proposed changes aimed at seniors won‚Äôt go into effect until 2028.
2,"Until our Congress and that includes every Democrat, Independent, and Republican, man and woman, STOPS taking bribes (monetary donations) from the Pharmaceutical companies in our USA, we will NEVER have the benefit of negotiating the lowest price! It is the same exact reason we will never have Universal Health Care (Medicare For All)! No other Country in our world has paid higher costs for medicine and health care, than the USA!"
2,Drug companies wouldn't have to charge it they didnt have to have stock piles of money for law suits in this country. Ever drug out there a lawyer trying to bv sue them over
2,"Buy a bus pass. Canadian taxes are extremely high, but they get a lot for their money unlike California."
2,As long as the uninsured aren't charged the maximum inflated amount to make up for lost profits.
2,We need to wake up to what's going on. We first need to vote and get out Country back before it's too late. There are way to many distractions. We are so close to becoming a dictatorship. Then we will not have to worry about any of this other stuff. We'll have nothing. We will be lookingüôè for a Country to take us in -as immigrants and see how kind that will be for us.
2,The engine that drives capitalism is competition. When there is a monopoly there is no competition. Russian and American oligarchs gave us rule by monopoly-ist.
2,We should also be talking about how to prevent type 2 diabetes with a proper human diet.
2,"Yup. Having grown up in both, I can say there are some notable and noticeable aberrations in the neighbouring pharmaceutical philosophies."
2,We are all sick of it but Congress is getting paid off too much by big Pharma so nothing will change. Greed needs to stop in Congress FIRST! Can you get that done???
0,"The laws of supply and demand are so easily manipulated to benefit the seller and satisfy the stock holder. ""Nothing personal, it's just business"" a quote from ""The Godfather"" is the mantra of the drug industry. Moral, ethical and fair trade practices are gone the way of the dinosaurs. It's the way of Trumpian economics. I'm left wondering if the corporations can be held culpable of involuntary malicious homicide. Given the drugs the deceased needed are less costly a few miles away in Canada...ü§îüò≤üò°üòî"
2,So lotteries for people with the vaccine. Free testing free vaccines. Huh no free insulin?
0,I thought the solution was to cut the tax of the Novo Nordisk CEO? That‚Äôs what you were moaning about before‚Ä¶
2,"I'm Swedish, but if I had been American I would have fought hard for improving the health care system in the US, the richest country in the world. Sure, many people think of Sweden as a communist hellhole (we're not a communist country, we have a social democratic government, labour party), and we DO pay higher taxes compared to many other countries (but not a 60 % flat rate income tax, a lot of people are convinced we pay that). Anyway, the taxes are spent on health care among other things. Insulin is free, no cost for the patient at all.

Yes, I'm very aware you can't compare the US to Sweden. We're a small country with a different system. But if anyone is going to change the system, it's Bernie. He would be a kick-*ss president.

I'm an outsider looking in, and to me it seems like your system allows the greedy companies to be in control, to do as they please and charge people whatever they want."
2,"Yes, Bernie, who cannot agree? But the shareholders, Bernie, the shareholders! They vote too."
2,"I am sick and tired of hearing you and your ilk using this as a platform, but never actually doing anything about it at all."
2,"Sick of being suckered by the politicians who are paid by big Pharma to keep prices up , we are being scalped by the politicians who are supposed to be protecting us. Vote all the bums out until they stop screwing us."
2,"Yes - this is unacceptable. EVERYONE thinks it's unacceptable - everyone except certain greedy lawmakers. We need to replace representatives
who refuse to do the will of the people."
2,All republicans and three democrats voted against letting Medicare negotiate drug prices. What‚Äôs next?
2,"Cost in Australia if your 60 yrs old or older. Or make less than 39,000 . 5 dollars. For everyone else 12 dollars Australian ."
0,"Go Bernie! That is exactly on point! Keep on it and make it an issue in the upcoming elections. Accountability!
! Thanks for the continued effort."
1,"You know, might as well start a news show, the way you feed us information, but don't seem to be doing anything. If this is the way Democrats deal with being in power.... we got a tough fucking road ahead."
2,Anyone that's been in congress for decades and allowed this to legally happen should be in prison
2,"I bet that vile in Canada costs $100 but since the government pays a subsidy, the patients part is $12."
2,"Why can't Americans just buy the insulin from Canada? Let me guess, because the government says so."
2,"Cost of one vial in Puerto Rico, Lantus $485 dls, Insulin Lispro (humalog) 375 dls. üò¢"
2,"Then do something. Talk, talk, talk. Can‚Äôt rally the troops Bernie?"
2,The solution to this might be to prevent diabetes in people in the first place
2,Who will subsidize the drug companies profits if we won‚Äôt.
0,"Well Bernie, seems like the republicans like for us to pay the higher prices n there is something that you n me can do!!! VOTE for Team Blue!!"
2,You are an angry old man who needs to retire. You bring nothing to our country or it‚Äôs people. Never have.
2,You also need to fix the patent system since Big Pharma routinely game that
2,If government got out of the way the price would naturally come down.
2,Bernie where you getting $100 insulin? My stuff is over $1500

2,"What I don't get is how the corporation gets sole ownership of the patent if the American citizens are paying for the research and development of many of these drugs.

First, that sounds 100% like an administrative failure. Drug companies don't just get this research funding out of thin air. They negotiate with the government for them. Exactly like with the Covid vaccines. That deal has been outstanding for the American people. Could you imagine if everyone had to buy our vaccines out of pocket or through insurance? We probably wouldn't have 25% of Americans vaccinated, and they'd be coming from Europe.

I would laugh in the face of a drug co CEO if he came to me with a bullshit deal like what we have been getting. I would feel like he was spitting in my face. I would kick them out of the White House and call his biggest competitor asking if they would like to be the first drug company to release xyz drug? Yeah? Great, but if Americans are paying for the research we get royalties on sales which will go to help fund future medical research, and there will be cap limits on American patients, with lower caps for the elderly and veterans. We would get that drug developed and CEOs would seriously think twice about going to the White House thinking that they are going to scam the American people."

TooFarLeft
Education is a good investment from an individual, family, community or national perspective and tuition free education will reduce the burden from the root on our medical expenses too for example.

Healthcare for all is actually CHEAPER with the insurance industry off of the table along with most of the time lost due to billing among many other reasons.

A universal basic income (UBI) is CHEAPER than all of the thousands of individual federal, state and local social safety net programs including things like Social Security and unemployment insurance, etc with all of their budgets, overhead expenses and inefficiencies eliminating the humiliating need for people to lose time to prove their poverty to qualify for aid.

Internet for all is a great and necessary investment to give everyone the opportunity to study, search for work, work remotely, etc online.

Solar power is CHEAPER and electric vehicles are soon to be CHEAPER to make and already are considerably CHEAPER to maintain and operate, especially if charged from your own solar power.

What do you think will happen to crime rates, peace and equality in general after we launch universal healthcare, a universal basic income, universal education and internet for all, raising the starting point of capitalism from zero, we‚Äôll let you die with no money, to a level of life with dignity, reducing societal daily fears on a massive scale and freeing us to welcome the automation revolution with open arms rather than with fear and great harm? üòÉ EqualityMovemen

Depriving the manufacturers of their intellectual property, investment return, worthwhile risk, and return on costly research. Often times forcing those companies to sell drugs below cost rather than being put out of business. The US couldn‚Äôt care less about protecting innovations and intellectual property abroad so those companies have to make a profit somewhere. That all being said, you are highly full of üí© as usual not sharing free and substantially lower prices that your followers could receive (yes, WITHOUT insurance). I wonder how much innovation in medicine we‚Äôd have if we didn‚Äôt have incentives for companies to make new medical progress. I sure bet a socially managed drug world would stifle the advancement that these companies do and create. Focus on stopping your comrades in other countries and the white house from stealing from innovators and make them all pay their fair share. Why is there never any substance, background or solutions that exist that you can share? Greed my ass. Explain the dynamics and why what happens does. Hint: drug companies need to turn a profit and take on tremendous amounts of risk, failure, and loss. Protect American companies from getting robbed by socialist country extortion artists, defend intellectual property, and the prices will come down. You have such a presence and platform that could be used for good. All you do is fear monger instead of providing existing solutions and support for innovation. Socialist America is its own worst enemy. I wonder how many people you kill each year by convincing them it‚Äôs hopeless when there are options for them to get their medications for next to nothing or free."

How far should rules go? Desert Sun Gannett Article

I commend the Palm Springs City Council for going further than almost every other city, even the most progressive, in enacting both a vaccine and a mask mandate. Even San Francisco and New York have only mandated one or the other.

The city should now mandate medical grade masks, since cloth masks are virtually useless. In fact, they should unilaterally re-enact Newsom‚Äôs old color coded system, and require strict capacity limitations and masking outdoors. We need at least a 50% capacity restriction, plus a mask mandate, plus a vaccine mandate to control the virus now. And leave more restrictions options on the table if people just won‚Äôt behave.

The fact that some would actually agree with what I just wrote is terrifying.

The IC, America's 18 intelligence agencies, could reach only a few definitive conclusions. The agencies said they needed more information, but the world now knows enough to begin imposing severe costs on China.
America and other nations must impose those costs to prevent China's Communist Party from releasing a civilization-ki
lling disease. Yes, the People's Liberation Army is now developing pathogens to destroy non-Chinese societies.
""The IC assesses that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, probably emerged and infected humans through an initial small-scale exposure that occurred no later than November 2019 with the first known cluster of COVID-19 cases arising in Wuhan, China in December 2019,"" the summary states."

You are in the Senate, even states are already ahead and ready to import drugs at lower price.

‚ÄòReasonable people can disagree about when a zygote becomes a ""human life"" - that's a philosophical question. However, regardless of whether or not one believes a fetus is ethically equivalent to an adult, it doesn't obligate a mother to sacrifice her body autonomy for another, innocent or not.

Body autonomy is a critical component of the right to privacy protected by the Constitution, as decided in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), McFall v. Shimp (1978), and of course Roe v. Wade (1973). Consider a scenario where you are a perfect bone marrow match for a child with severe aplastic anemia; no other person on earth is a close enough match to save the child's life, and the child will certainly die without a bone marrow transplant from you. If you decided that you did not want to donate your marrow to save the child, for whatever reason, the state cannot demand the use of any part of your body for something to which you do not consent. It doesn't matter if the procedure required to complete the donation is trivial, or if the rationale for refusing is flimsy and arbitrary, or if the procedure is the only hope the child has to survive, or if the child is a genius or a saint or anything else - the decision to donate must be voluntary to be constitutional.
This right is even extended to a person's body after they die; if they did not voluntarily commit to donate their organs while alive, their organs cannot be harvested after death, regardless of how useless those organs are to the deceased or many lives they would save. That's the law.

Use of a woman's uterus to save a life is no different from use of her bone marrow to save a life - it must be offered voluntarily. By all means, profess your belief that providing one's uterus to save the child is morally just, and refusing is morally wrong. That is a defensible philosophical position, regardless of who agrees and who disagrees. But legally, it must be the woman's choice to carry out the pregnancy. She may choose to carry the baby to term. She may choose not to. Either decision could be made for all the right reasons, all the wrong reasons, or anything in between. But it must be her choice, and protecting the right of body autonomy means the law is on her side. Supporting that precedent is what being pro-choice means.‚Äô‚Äù ~ from a friend"

1,"What's funny to me is that the people that are on board with the masks, shot, and stay at home orders REALLY believe that it will end. That it's only temporary. They never notice the gov never speaks of an end. Just more and more restrictions. It's horrifying to think people are this blind."
1,Radical left will try to get every one of our rights eliminated.
1,"After so long of being told to stay home, don‚Äôt talk or interact with anyone and mandatory lockdowns the people will get tired of it! The people will raise up against their ‚Äúleaders‚Äù and we will see countries succumb to revolutions much like the French Revolution! The people will get tired of being controlled, lied to and fed lines that the governing bodies knows what‚Äôs best for you while they‚Äôre actively breaking their own mandates and requirements to semi participate in society."
1,I have a sense of humor. I won't take a joke (Nancy Pelosi) seriously.
1,Maybe now Australians will regret giving away there firearms rights
1,"Pelosi was tricked into giving this speech for $30,000 for each ticket. Just like she got tricked into getting a haircut when she had the salon owner open up her non-essential business."
2,Not all of us are too far gone Tucker. We cannot laugh because once vibrant cities have been destroyed and hardworking Australians have lost all.
0,"The Nobles Elites billionaires all they want is there way. They want to treat humans like slaves, control and you wonder why the Taliban Insurgency got the best of our USA. That why our forefathers wrote the Constitution so as the wealthy Elite could not run over us humans. ""Peace Shalom"""
2,No. She thinks she is above the law. So sad. The world is heading in The wrong direction. Praying we all somehow get thru this.
2,The fact that anyone can ignore this hypocrisy and corruption is unreal. These are insane times.
1,"Highly predictable 0utcomes from and by Governments that want to and have confiscated their guns, loss of free expression and the right to peacefully protest against the government is taken away, and Tyranical Woke Leftist Powers and impositions by the Government follow quickly, who could believe what is and has happened in Australia and New Zealand"
1,"Just another evening in the world of the hypocritical ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù
extreme left, who are all mysteriously immune to COVID 19 and free from government suppression, unlike their masked servants."
2,"Typically you will see the Government gain control by fear or free stuff.
The message: for Thee but not for me.
Hopefully more Americans will wake up and see what‚Äôs going on here."
1,"I live in Melbourne and would move to Florida if the Australian Government would open the borders and let us leave.

It is 1960""s Russia here."
1,People must have been smarter back then because Democrats have been applying the mask mandates for us peasants for over a year but not following the same mandates themselves and we keep allowing it to happen.
2,"I live in Melbourne, Australia Tucker, I'm in my 50s now & am so disturbed about what is happening here üò≥ Thank you for reporting the truth & sharing the plight of my country üôè I'm scared to leave my home here & barely go out, this is not the country I grew up in & loved, this is hell on earth üò¢"
1,Highest hypocrisy from dems. A little bit of science and anyone can get that mask doesn‚Äôt protect but destroys your lungs and immune system.
2,Complete control of we the people using scare tactics until we expose them for what they really are. Domestic Terrorist groups and this Tyranny group are all about totally controlling we the people and destroying our Great Society any way they can so they can stay in power
2,"Here in Washington state the governor's mandate on the vaccine, excludes himself, all cabinet members, all state commissioners, and all state board members, but their employees MUST get the vaccine. Makes you go hmmm."
2,"Worst thing about it: I saw footage of protest here on facebook from some Australian outlet. And 99% of comments was: ""so many stupid and selfish people, they deserve what they got, they treated them too lightly.""
I found only 3 comments supporting the protesters.
I must say I was shocked especially by how many people used the term ""selfish"" parroting the mass media. Brainwashed."
2,"Disgusting. How can anyone continue to elect such garbage? Off topic, and this isn't a left or right thing, because there are plenty on the right too, but holding a government position for this long, gaining the wealth and power she has from it, shouldn't be allowed. For Pete's sake... üò°"
1,We are the deplorable servants. She is the elitist who wants to put a crown on her head so we can bow down and kiss her behind. Over my dead body.
0,"Australia has apparently come full circle.
Prison colony to prison country"
1,"From Australia, here is the link to the 12 year old girl being handcuffed, man -handled, and arrested for the high crime of not wearing a face mask ..... judge for yourselves ....//

2,"I can't believe police in Australia have sunk to an all time low and are arresting citizens for basically nothing.....Ver
y sad .....our world is becoming ""1984)"
2,Cant make this crap up.....Im so disgusted with our current hypocrits in office. Wake up America and take our country back
2,It‚Äôs absolute frightening lunacy! Thank you for showing this. We as Americans need to see where this is heading.
1,"When is Pelosi being impeached? Oh that's right, she's a Democrat. They are protected by hypocrisy."
2,I was just talking about this. I don't watch Fox News anymore but this is exactly what I have been trying to say. Look at the tyrannical policies being enforced. It's coming to the US if people don't wake up. Read the studies and look at the science. Don't just take the word of mainstream media. They are trying to push a narrative that is absolutely not supported by the science. This is absolutely sickening.
1,"Yes it is every bit as bad in Melbourne Australia as it appears!
200 plus days of hard lockdown plus a similar amount under heavy restrictions such as not being allowed to have any visitors, work, travel more than 5kms,( 3 miles), and curfew from 9pm to 5am.
We are under the control of an insane dictator obsessed with eradication of the virus while nuking everything!
Kids and people are topping themselves or attempting to, and going around the bend.
Fine for going to the protest or disobeying rules is $5000 dollars!!
The mainstream media are pushing the same propaganda as the Andrews government has inflicted on us.
Lockdowns mightn't even end after we hit 80% vaccinated, now they're pushing for kids to be included!
I Weep for my children's future, democracy Worldwide has never been more in peril! üòï"
1,"Australia is a perfect example of why Americans should be so grateful of the 2nd amendment and do everything you can to protect it!
I don‚Äôt believe Australia‚Äôs government would be doing what they‚Äôre doing if they had a nation full of arm citizens."
2,"Let's not forget that the government has confiscated all the civilian guns as well. Oh that's right, they were forcefully surrendered."
1,"I am from a Suburb in Sydney, NSW. Every morning at 11am all the MSM televise our Premier, Gladys Berajiglian ranting and raving about this Delta virus and the dangers of it. We went into lockdown on 26 June 2021 and as of Monday 23rd August, she placed a curfew, no one allowed out of their home between 9pm -5am. when this Delta outbreak began, she said 1,000sands are going to get the virus and 1,000sands are going to die. So far 130 have passed away, and I would be confident to say 100 died of old age and the rest died of other illnesses other than Delta. They even listed a 15yr old boy as a Covid death who was in Hospital for menningacoccal.
It is absolute Tyranny in the state of NSW. We are not even allowed to protest, the Government has given the Police force all powers to make sure of that.

They have scared the population so much that 6,000,000 have had at least 1 dose of the vaccine.

We are living in a nightmare in ""The Lucky Country."
2,"She is the poster child for ‚ÄúTerm Limits ‚Äú‚Ä¶.$30,000 a plate to hear this windbag blow‚Ä¶Money could have been well spent on other things within her community she serves‚Ä¶Complete
and utter disgrace‚Ä¶."
1,"I'm in Melbourne I haven't heard any reports about the dog shooting ,we're not under marshal law, the ADF is assisting the police in NSW with checking on people who should be isolating as far as know. We are under a curfew 9pm to 5am,and we need permits to work, and that's if your an essential worker, our lockdown rules are pretty harsh, I can't visit my daughters, can only travel over 5kms for work, not pleasure. No standard retail is open, only essential shopping centres, and Saturdays protest came out of pure frustration, people are tired of being locked away, it's a shame it came to that, but people are on edge. If we do get to 80% vaccination, Queensland and Western Australia have said they may not open their boarders to other states ,because they won't 0 covid, so yep we're doing it hard down under. üá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫"
1,Australia is a perfect example of what happens to an UNARMED population....
2,All Americans should of made a stand to stop the control long before the Afghanistan mess.
1,No one can trust their government and do not give up Any constitutional rights or rights to protect yourself
2,Coming to America soon if men and women don‚Äôt realize today that this country‚Äôs freedoms we still have is worth fighting for.
1,When komunist and fascism gets together everyone will be afraid of flu üò¢. Sad to let the history repeat more worst
1,Thanks Tucker Carlson Tonight It's true here in Melbourne. Lockup 6.0 Only allowed out for 5 reasons. Get caught too far from home they fine ya. Curfew. 5km limit. Permits for everything. Kids still learning online. Mental health issues growing. Vacant shops growing. Yet people keep voting the socialists back in.
1,"All this is Happening because they gave up their Guns..If they were a Armed Society this wouldn't be Happening..Ever
y Gun Manufacturer in the US is Expanding its operations to keep up with the Demand for Guns in the us..People know what's going on an they're getting Ready for It.."
2,"These people are brainwashed and the people that have been elected should be charged with treason that's my background and knowing what people should be charged with. It's disgusting to see that they're tearing families apart friends apart jobs apart this is horrible people need to wake up
."
1,"They first took their guns see what can happen ""O"" it can not happen in the USA"
2,"No. My body, my choice. They do not have the right or power to control medical decisions on anyone else's behalf. Mask mandates are illegal. Vaccine mandates are illegal. Any mandate made by the branch is illegal. Only the legislature can write laws, and still are limited by the United States constitution as well as each individual state's constitutions. That is it's purpose...to limit their control. We the people are the boss, not our representatives
. They were elected to represent us, not rule us."
2,"The fact that people aren‚Äôt fed up with all the blatant hypocrisy going on in our government, media or you name it is appalling!! Wake Up!!"
0,"Question...is it the owner that is requiring the employees wear a mask or is it Pelosi? I dont think it's Pelosi. I think it's the caterer and the employees may be going in and out of a building.

We don't have all the facts.

Plus they are outside...masks
are not required outside."
1,"I live in Melbourne, Australia üá¶üá∫ and I can tell you this stuff is happening. It's scary now the government wants kids five years old and up to wear a mask"
2,This is where police have to draw the line and refuse to do the bidding of the government. To participate is reprehensible.
2,"Love your stuff, Tucker. One thing, the Aussie they are hunting was COVID positive and avoiding isolation (currently 14 days of quarantine). He wasn't just avoiding the lockdown, he was knowingly infecting those around him."
0,You skipped the part where Matt Lawson was shot with rubber bullets! The man being dragged into the blockade was shot i think 8 times on his body while 2 other coppers sprayed him with pepper spray. Gutless wonders is what it's called here!
1,"Tucker‚Ä¶.you need to be an investigative reporter that you are and solidify who is actually running this country and trying to change it forever‚Ä¶.you have hinted to it in the past, but we the people want to know who the hell it is. Thank you for what you do everyday"
2,How are Australians not attempting to overthrow their government right now.
2,"Say this out loud and let it sink in...""ELECTIONS
HAVE CONSEQUENCES"". The people that are being elected at every level of government from your local school board to the President don't have your best interests in mind. They run for positions for power and to execute their will not your will or the will of the majority. Take every election as a serious measure to ensure you only your well being but maintain your freedom. Or else this will become Australia..."
1,This was seriously a scary segment. The hypocrisy from Nancy Pelosi is nothing new. She‚Äôs a disgrace. But the drama going on in Australia is unbelievable. I‚Äôm sure none of them are reporting any deaths from cancer or the flu or heart attacks. Over a year later‚Ä¶. And the WORLD still has zero clue.
2,We need to take back our government they are doing nothing for us.
0,"Martial law is coming to us soon, just watch! Our administration wants 2 classes of people, the very rich and the very poor who work to support the rich. Does this sound familiar? We‚Äôve seen it before, just not here‚Ä¶yet."
1,"Our KY state Governor has done same , caught in photos without mask in public events, after mandating masks.üò°"
1,"Why don't you wear a mask Pelosi and I'll do want I want, FREEDOM!"
2,This absolutely terrifying to me. Americans better wake the hell up & start fighting back!
1,Australia gave in when they gave up their guns they gave up their second amendment and they gave up everything that it took for their first amendment their third and everyone else after that Australia caved and they allowed it to happen plain and simple
1,"And they are coming to New Jersey too because our governor is a feckless progressive who has no respect for his constituents.
He prefers criminals illegals and people who like to give away taxpayers money like water."
1,"This is the end result of gun confiscation, what was shown going on in Australia is what happens to a docile unarmed populace. The only reason the powers that be here in the US cannot do what the Aussie's are doing is because of our 2nd Amendment and 500+ million weapons in civilian hands. Once push came to shove as seen with the authoritarianis
m in Australia, American's would fight back but we would not comply with this kind of brutality on our streets from the government. Of course this is just my opinion on what i just saw."
1,Wow! Mr Carlson it must be really frustrating and devastating for you to to provide these news to us. May the Angels of God be with you and your family. God bless you for your heroic love. A God help us deal with tge New world we are facing.
1,I bet they wish they wouldn't have gave up their firearms now. America would be just like this if we didn't have a 2nd Amendment
1,There is evidence that it also spreads via shedding or fecal matter‚Ä¶ so when they finally accept that bit of scientific data maybe they will realize that all the lockdowns and isolating people in groups trapped in their own domiciles was not the smartest idea. The people in charge are going about this all wrong.
2,"Stop calling our elected representatives
leaders!! They work for us and should be representing us‚Ä¶ not leading anything.. rather serving!!"
2,Apparently ppl back then had more integrity than ppl today!
0,I would suggest that Tucker Carlson and others concentrate on fixing what's wrong it their own back yard before they start knocking other places. As usual the story is dramatised out of proportion.
2,Actions always speak louder than words! She is as fake as they come!!
1,Intolerable laws sparked the 1775 revolutionary war of independence against the British Crown. Here we go again waiting for another war of independence against the Democrstic wealthy elite.
0,It will be alot of blood in the streets if that happens in this country to many people with guns and military training the don't agree with this behavior from the government. Just my opinion
2,"Tucker Carlson how dare you call the New Zealand President ""The lady with the teeth who is very popular""
Tucker Carlson, how dare you imply the Govenor of the State of Victoria is a lunatic for saying ""We are breaking the rules if we watch the sunset"" !
PS. I agree with you."
2,Unfortunately there are a number of people who can have all the evidence continually shoved in their faces and it will not make a bit of difference.
2,The hypocrisy within our government is beyond redemption. These oligarchs need to be removed before Americans will ever trust the government again. Does anyone know what the % is on Americans who don't trust the government is? It has to be higher than ever.
1,"It's so very sad for the real people of the United States of America, to have to continue to put up with the Biden administration what a load of rubbish the Biden administration has TURNED out to be. There's no way the real people of the United States of America are being held accountable for the Biden administration.
God bless you all."
1,"Australia is a perfect example when the people become complacent and allow their government to disarm them and rule over them.

Quite frankly I thought Australians were smarter than this. I can see Brits allowing it but I never thought the Aussies would."
2,They are ‚Äúsophisticated people‚Äù like the ones at Obama‚Äôs b-day party. No masks needed.
1,"Fact of the matter....peopl
e don't wear masks when they eat. Having this type of event in NAP with a high rate of COVID is typically Democratic poor optics and she doesn't care. She is the most powerful person in DC...more powerful than the President, and is in Napa to raise money for the Dems and preserve that woeful Gavin Newsome's governorship. Politics, power, and money are far more important to her...witness what she has or has not done for the people of CA in her time in Congress....and
the Dems continue to elect her......pitifu
l.....I left CA in 2013 for TN and while I love the state and all it offers, the politics, economics, social justice, and environmentalis
ts have ridden the Dem and state train into the ground...."
2,"Facebook keeps removing my ""Like"" and ""Angry"" status on this post. I wonder why? Is it going against their community standards?"
0,"Some of your facts are wrong, example only half of Australia is in Lockdown . Sydney NSW , and Melbourne VIC , the rest of the states ( 4 ) are open fully with no restrictions. The other facts are correct, but not explained fully. The man who sneezed in the lift has covid but will not isolate , he wasnts to spread covid to others that's why the Police are looking for him.
Religious services are banned because of lockdown rules , you can only zoom your services. This minister broke the rules knowingly and got caught. Yes the lockdown is over the top , only because of the low vaccine rate in the beginning, now the rates have increased dramatically . Enjoy your show from down under , Sydney, Australia .üëç"
1,"That‚Äôs the state of Victoria which is run by a communist, Daniel Andrews. The protesters should rally around recalling Andrews and running for political office to change these communist rules he‚Äôs put in place."
1,Her little drama queen aoc needs to be the first to wear a mask as well as Schumer and herself
2,Tucker Carlson Tonight I am Australian and the horse lady made me laugh for a bit then you got to the very real segments about Australia and I cried at how accurately wrong we are being treated it‚Äôs an absolute disgrace and so disheartening. Many here are just getting on with their lives whilst our fellow Australians just across the Queensland border into New South Wales are being treated like leapers. I am afraid for our children‚Äôs futures üò¢
2,Don‚Äôt worry about the police beating you with batons... they just want you to stay healthy. üôÑ
2,I'm surprised you did not mention the forced vü™ìination of children. They physically ripped children from their parents' arms and vü™ìinated them.
2,"If you haven‚Äôt watch the movie ‚ÄúThe Hunger Games‚Äù, go ahead and watch all! If you ever notice movies are years in advanced of what could and might happen to our world/ country! The thing is no one wants to believe it! Quit giving up your control! Vote these people out b4 it‚Äôs to late!"
2,How many times did she say young people in less than a minute. The young people are the vulnerable. Raise your kids right.
2,Oh god. This is too sad. As a New Zealander with friends and family in Australia hearing what a compliant community we are makes me realize just how we would have behaved in Nazi Germany.
2,We should have done this last summer when all the rioting and looting was going on. Our us police in every state should have been allowed to use the same kind of force.
2,It's coming to all nations. This is leading to the return of Jesus for the Church. The anti christ will be revealed. Ppl have seen nothing yet.
2,We are with you Australia stand up and fight for your right.
1,"Im an Aussie living in South Australia, we haven't had a new case of C19 for weeks and have had 4 deaths since the start of the plague, but we are still forced to wear face diapers in public."
2,"Anyone who thinks and feels your beneath them is worst than racism, especially when it's coming from your own goverment"
2,"Believe me, I can‚Äôt stand Pelosi, but in fairness this was outdoors, and I am way against giving the maskholes any more ammo."
1,They need to come after Nancy and Obama..... They just held Super spreader events.... LOL.
1,"The thugs in police uniforms started the violence, and sharpshooters wielding military spec automatic rifles were shooting pepper bombs at people, one hitting a 10 year old boy. Others shot rubber bullets, and at least 2 mounted among them ran their terrified horses directly at the people.

No Tucker, this is NOT the Australia you know, and whose Army Engineers‚Äô uniform I once wore with pride.

It‚Äôs now home to the socialist thugs running roughshod over the people. You‚Äôre right about one thing; Victorian, Queensland and Western Australian voters have recently voted them back in.

It‚Äôs unbelievable and, IF I could afford it, and IF I could leave (yes, locked in, locked up and locked down), I‚Äôd emigrate."
2,This kind of crap has been out there since the beginning the problem is people will not listen people will not take charge of thier own choices own life
1,"Maria Papademetri
You must listen to this. They shot dogs in Australia so people wouldn‚Äôt leave their homes to adopt. Much of what he is saying also took place when Stalin was in power. My mother told me of not being allowed to talk to anyone as they‚Äôre being told in Australia now."
1,"What about the next mandate? Do you really believe, after seeing this and Obamas birthday party, that these people are getting the vaccine? Or is it all for show so the masses are mandated? Vaccine is not mandated for the White House or Phizer employees."
2,"Power mad it‚Äôs dangerous, no caring or compassion for anyone . Very sick leaders"
2,"To be fair, it's NOT the federal government of Australia implementing these draconian lockdowns, it's the individual state leaders, over the last 19 months it's shown the the feds only collect taxes and defend the shores"
2,Democrats can do anything they Want to. It's EVERYONE else thay can't. Just remember if you're getting aeay with something there's always someone else going to get you!
1,People are ignoring reports like this and letting their fellow citizens be targeted and made to be criminals. Covid mandates and lockdowns are creating a reward system. Comply and we give you back your freedoms. Till they stop doing that too.
1,"Im in Queensland, Australia.
Certain States have different rules, Victoria is the most totalitarian, New south wales is a bit better, but stil mandating masks and forced vaccinations, but the other 4 states and 2 territories aren't in lock down.
There may be a 3 day lock down here and there if there are 30 ish cases, but it depends on how much of a Dictator the state health officer is"
2,Well we must love hypocrisy today. Because a lot of it is taking place right now and it seems like no one cares
2,The media here plays scenes of people at these rallies calling them selfish with the evil foreboding music in the background and then switch to hopeful uplifting music when showing people in line to get vaccinated calling them heroes.
2,"More Mandates are coming. If they can legally fire someone for not wanting to take the vaccine. Once they declare Global warming a crisis. Your travel will be greatly restricted.
Anyone in politics... regardless the political party they belong too. Should immediately be voted out of office. Sad to say... but for the most part. All of us on here are a systemic part of the problem. We get riled up but quickly calm down. Myself included."
2,We need to stand together & stand up for our rights!!
1,Who‚Äôs going to print the T-shirt‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a dangerous slacker cause a won‚Äôt wear a mask so shoot me‚Äù cause I will wear one. Totally not tasteful but the whole thing is beyond absurd and most Americans are beyond fed up and that also speaking up in defense also of this heinous crime too. The world has gone insane and it‚Äôs time to stand up!
1,"The only reason why I wear a mask, is because I can't afford the $200 ticket the police will give me here in Israel. It's horrible."
1,Shocking but so happy Tucker is speaking out!!! I hope ALL Americans watch this!!!
1,"I have great respect Tucker, and by no means agree with mask mandate. But they are at a table, outside, fixing to eat. Now how do you eat a 30k meal with a mask on. Even Republicans take them off to eat.
This is getting attention for silly reasons."
1,I can‚Äôt with all this. We are going to start killing dogs now because of covid. Society is sick.
1,It's time we stand strong against this bs! They cannot jail all of us o r get money from the poor? They cannot keep up with rules? Rules are made to be bent and laws are made to be broken as far as this ridiculous mandate goes
1,This is not some communist country -- this is AUSTRALIA! We canNOT let this happen here!
1,Who is giving these leaders these rules. They are obviously getting there rules from some higher authority and it definitely not the WHO it‚Äôs something else. This is a takeover of the world and people need to put politics aside and stand up against this tyranny!!!!
2,"""....the people making and enforcing the rules had no intention of following the rules"".........
YEP, that about sums it up right there"
1,Just like Obama's party they all know this is nonsense. They aren't saying so but they're demonstrating it very clearly all of them. They only put on masks for the TV camera.
2,Our mask mandates go into effect Thursday. Mask exceptions on the list: courts in session and meetings or sessions of the Nebraska Legislature üëÄ
2,"Not all Aussies are taking this lying down. Hence why there were thousands in Melbourne, lots in Queensland (who the police could only standby and watch because they were not in lockdown), and in Sydney. You‚Äôre affiliate in Australia (Skynews) is all over it and has a growing following. As you said, people will tolerate a little inconvenience but not hypocrisy."
1,"I can‚Äôt believe what I‚Äôm looking at. How can people accept being treated like prisoners being herded by thugs in uniform‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ all because of a bloody mask.
It is really sinister watching this. And listening to that New Zealand nut warning people not to talk to their neighbors. This has to stop while we can still stop it."
1,"Tucker Carlson Tonight, you‚Äôre not completely correct in your Australian report. Not all of Australia is under Marshall law, just New South Wales and I think Victoria. Queensland is at this point still reasonably free, but it won‚Äôt take much for us to go under either. Interstate travel is near impossible though."
1,The Delta variant is completely undetectable. There is no PCR test or rapid test that can pick up on the Delta variant. The only thing they can believe is that fear is going to drive people to believe that this is a powerful virus. The Delta variant is a weak mutation
2,"What doesn‚Äôt amaze me is that you have a very big crowd that can easily overpower the officers arresting just one individual, but instead of helping they would rather record and just feel like they are doing something ‚Äúimportant‚Äù. That‚Ä¶ is selfish and ignorant‚Ä¶ no, sorry, that‚Äôs selfish and stupid. My opinion of course."
0,"tucker - you stated tonight that gov. abbott refused to,send national guard t the border - not true. they are there now assisting border patrol in arrests. there have been other guard there as well from other states."
2,"Yikes, they had crazy Karen's back in those times too, but with loaded guns üò≥üò¨ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è....well this type of same hyprocrisy of rules for thee, but not for we happened at the G7 too, and there were videos of it documented so why are we all wearing masks again? üôÑ"
2,The world has gone mad!!!! So many people just don't see it. Governments certainly have hidden agendas!
2,"As much as I appreciate the service that our law enforcement provides to our communities, I also know that at any given moment they can turn their backs on me. Not only did we see this happening in several blue states, but now we are seeing it in Canada, New Zealand and now in Australia. If people continue giving these authoritarian politicians more power, and later realized their mistake, by then it will be too late."
2,Wow what BS from Australia. They do not want people talking to each other to expose the lies that are being perpetrated on people.
2,"We've seen what the ""elite""/
will be-- doing!! I pray it shakes us to the core and simply refuse to do ANY unconstitutional act. Those who blame our ""protectors"" that are daily putting their lives on the line for you, shame on you!! Who are answering YOUR calls for help?? The tooth fairy??"
2,"It's coming people, happening in Australia. When is enough is enough. It's time ""WE THE PEOPLE"" take our country back."
1,We would turn Afghanistan in to the greatest country on earth if they sent all the Maga wearing non vaccinated there.
2,She was caught at hair salon ask about it and said some excuse and that she would not talk about it Any further no one pressured her let it go thus will also go away - it‚Äôs their way but they tell u what to do but do as they please and we wonder why the country is divided.
2,"Gr8. Fearless Pelosi can saddle up wth Biden, Harris & the squad & go rescue people out of Afghanistan."
1,"That's what happens when Citizens give up their arms, they become subjects and serfs."
2,"I have a theory that those people freak out so much about that crap because they've lived such shityy lives like stealing from their constituents, their nations and all around being degenerates that they are almost certain they are going to hell so they are doing literally anything to stay alive. Also take notice that their police and I'm sure ours in America will have absolutely zero issue with just following their orders."
2,It's so sad to see that Australians are now facing pure totalitarian fascism! I lived in Australia - Adelaide - in 2000-2001 and I enjoyed the relaxed freedom of Australians then. This is politics turned amok!
0,Tucker Carlson will you be leaving Fox now that they are requiring vaccines for all staff? It seems the hypocrisy is t just in Washington if you stay.
2,"Feudalism is the society they want to bring back.
""he dominant social system in medieval Europe, in which the nobility held lands from the Crown in exchange for military service, and vassals were in turn tenants of the nobles, while the peasants (villeins or serfs) were obliged to live on their lord's land and give him homage, labor, and a share of the produce, notionally in exchange for military protection."""
0,Friggin hypocrites. This is unacceptable. Why isn't something being done about it. Gutless Republicans need to show this video in Congress.
1,Hey Tucker I love your work man and your courage . Am in NZ and yes our esteemed leader it seems was trained by the best tyrants .
2,WHEN SOME PEOPLE HAD COMMON SENSE AND THE NEWS MEDIA SOMETIMES PRESENTED THE TRUTH! So sad those times are completely gone.
2,To bust the system every protester needed to turn themselves in to law enforcement go to jail and bust the bank account making them feed them it's all about the money
2,When will people WAKE UP and realize the sheer HYPOCRISY of this madness?
1,"This is the Democratic Party. Dangerous and hypocritical. Preaching we must all wear face diapers, while they go unmasked. People are hopefully waking up to the insanity!"
1,Good for thee but not for me. They are only mandating masks to turn us against each other. This happened to me yesterday at the Vet office where I was viscously verbally attacked by a woman and told to put on a mask. I was unprepared for this attack as everyplace is really left to your own discretion in our city right now. The only thing I could muster was I don‚Äôt do masks. She sat on the other side of the room videoing me and the whole waiting room and will probably put it on social-media. -I really don't care. Picking on a 100 pound grandma wearing a huge back brace from my recent surgery is how you‚Äôll recognize me. I work on my health everyday of my life as I have autoimmune and back issues. I have felt great for the past 8 years and even more since this recent surgery. She needs to take a look in the mirror at what appeared to me to be a very overweight unhealthy individual and worry about herself. PS I still have the antibodies from Covid that I got while in the Holocaust museum filled with Chinese students here on their winter break before any of us had even heard of it. I was very ill for 10 days. PS- I LIVED!
1,"Tucker, our leader (the lady with the teethü§£)
Just so happens she was the elected President of 'The International Union of Socialist Youth'
You can see her political beliefs have not changed.
We are locked down with under 30 deaths to covid total. ü§¶"
2,Sounds like Australia needs to be liberated... send in the troops muhahaha
1,Australians let them take their guns a long time ago. Now they have no way to resist.
2,To bad the police are against their own fellow citizens. It‚Äôs hard to believe that the world is willing to give it all up so easily. I‚Äôm sure that soon the sleeping giant will wake up and heads will be hurt.
2,"Man, what the heck is happening to common sense and people standing up! So sad and disturbing!"
2,Politicians are and have always been more sophisticated than the rest of us tax paying types..
2,I like and Tustin to a lot of what you say. However. How about looking at the death rates and exposure rates. A fair bit better than USA and Great Britain. I think there‚Äôs something to learn there personally
1,"Covid-19 spike I'm Fl. Hmmm, could it be nc hundred s of illegal s were transport we there and was told the vaccine is OPTIONAL?!"
0,Good thing Australia already disarmed all there citizens.. lolz
0,"Just scary times. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª. Vaccinated and unvaccinated can still spread covid.
Forced vaccinations will hurt some. Medical exemptions have always been there for a reason. Common sense. Your doctor should help you decide this with informed consent. Some people think they are more important then others. No one deserves to die from covid. Access to antibody treatment should be available to everyone. It is humanity. No one is more important then another. I‚Äôm sad seeing this happen. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüíî. If anaphylaxis with first covid shot or obtain GBs or causes a stroke from blood clots. The injured then aren‚Äôt allowed in public places????? Because couldn‚Äôt get their card. Instantly. The weak physically are told it‚Äôs best for them to protect them. Scary. You stay home. Why I go out because I‚Äôm stronger physically then you. While they still spread the disease. It‚Äôs heartbreaking. üíî
If your vaccinated with a ‚Äúcold‚Äù. It can still be covid and you can still spread it.
Need to enforce SICk POLICIES regardless of vaccination status. Not just punish vulnerable populations.
Next we will see voting rights taken away if don‚Äôt have covid card. I predict this coming. Insanity. Scary times!!!! God help us all!!! üôèüèª"
2,Criminals in commissions of Crimes often wear mask too ‚ÄúNanny Nancy‚Äù.... During the Civil War Slaves did too when they had no voice as their‚Äôs were leather and iron.... Doubt it??? Research it!!!!!
2,"Our health official in Nevada County, California referenced the Spanish Flu and jokingly held up gun fingers.

Everyone is so mad!!! We have called for his resignation. Dr. Kellerman. And our Board of Supervisors refuse to fire him for saying that publicly."
1,George Travancoor that‚Äôs why our governor relaxed rules on owning a gun. I‚Äôll be ready for anyone that tries to force a mask or a shot on or in me.
2,"Do you notice how without a mask, Pelosi is still wearing a mask?"
1,"Australia is now in the grip of dictators, my once proud free democratic country, is no more. The next step will be a license to breath."
1,It does not become any clearer than seeing it with your own eyes . The elite and power hungry are slowly sacrificing the people of this country. The second amendment was put into place to fight tyranny and tyranny we are victims of until we decide to stop playing this game.
2,"Um as I recall, Kamala started the political anti vx movement when she said ‚ÄúBut if Donald Trump tells us we should take it, I'm not going to take it.""üí©"
2,"A million little restrictions can be accepted by so many, when they can‚Äôt stand back and see the big picture."
2,"So much for wanting to visit Australia, looks a lot like North Korea now . Never give up your guns, our politicians still fear us and that is a good thing ."
1,"That‚Äôs what happens when you freely give up your guns. Sadly, this is only the beginning in Australia"
2,"WOW! The New World Order has started in every country. The elite wealthy do what they want and the rest of us are a part of the collective. We are basically told to sit down and shut your mouth you are common folk, we are nothing!"
1,When we gonna stand up and just say no????? I don‚Äôt wear one even when asked I got the Johnson shot because my wife asked me to because of her job she takes care of the elderly as an administrator at a retirement home. But the people telling us we have to wear one a mask because it‚Äôs so deadly but don‚Äôt even believe it‚Äôs that deadly them selves
1,People can‚Äôt turn their heads anymore thinking nothing can happen here! It‚Äôs happening and Nancy is leadings it. She‚Äôs crazy.
0,They make the civil rights movement come back alive in a different way
2,My daddy said his mother told him stories of the government nailing doors shut to keep people indoors in the last pandemic. Did anyone else hear of this happening?
1,They gave up their guns and that's what happens!
1,"This said it all, look how brave our leaders are not fearing the virus"
1,It's not about a virus...if it was the borders would be closed. It's about control at this point...
1,I am Australian I can see the lunacy in this and millions of Australians do but we are powerless our government has also been hijacked by leftist communist ratbags and our police became the Gestapo overnight unbelievable
2,That‚Äôs because they are all brainwashed. If people would start standing up for our freedom and our rights.
2,"Yep, it‚Äôs nuts over here. Tucker Carlson Tonight in reference to the church gathering. They were dobbed on by people for meeting. The church was fined $5000 (AUD) for having no QR Code (Registered government digital contact tracing system) and 31 individuals were fined $1000 each. The NSW Police Commissioner also said he is considering closing down the church permanently."
1,Isn't that indicative of the fact that something is going on. And you can bet that the folks in power had protection before this virus was released.
1,The government stole Australians‚Äô guns for a reason.
2,Leaders create this chaos then blame the cops who they force to control it. Notice their hands stay clean.
1,"Don't post this just on social sides post this on her page LoL.. if this would be a pandemic and be so dangerous and all this drama this witches (B) saying it is, there are the ones who would be in a bunker .. this is a control game and why is no one shows her or who ever get cut this pictures and late them explain it to us WTF THEY THINK THEY DOING .. EXPLAIN THIS where is the Covid .. so much BS makes my head spin.. and ppl believe all this covid crap"
2,Frightening how the sheep follow along... Australia is so far gone... we're not far behind.
1,But the first thing the government did in Australia is take their guns. Now they have no power to resist.
2,Why is this being tolerated by the masses??! We out number them.
2,"Those videos from Australia apply to Victoria and NSW, Most states aren't locked down, and it's certainly not nationwide. Having said that, people in Australia are pissed off about lockdiwns because the federal government refuses to address the continual leaks from hotel quarantine that are causing covid to spread."
1,"Im from Melbourne and i can confirm that this is all true, leaving your house will get you a $5000 fine but because people arnt paying the fine the government now wants to seize property to make up for it, its insane"
2,What is a ‚ÄúMild Protestant‚Äù
2,The ‚Äúslacker‚Äù who was shot was maskless in the street and a health inspector led him to a store to get a mask when the slacker hit him over the head and started beating him. The inspector shot in self defense. Both received charges. Google is free yall
1,"Terry Leef Abood you might like this. What's good for the goose isn't necessarily good for the gander. Really ticks me off seeing Pelosi and the rest trying to control my life. ""We the people"" are forgotten and in some ways dying needlessly to further their agenda."
2,They really shouldn‚Äôt be rich these dark elements in society they should prove and justify or go the hell to jail
1,the democrats are going to try and push this until the vote in 2022 mail in vote is the only way to win
2,"Where are these people who consider themselves "" elite "" going to run when the Country finally cones after them?
Like the mafia, there won't be anywhere that they can hide to escape the punishment that they brought upon themselves"
1,"America does not leave Americans behind Nor do we play nice guy with the enemy.
This is a posture of weakness. We will do what ever it takes . Stand Up Americans Wake Up
What this Administration is doing is Outrageous!!! I'm asking for the President and the administration to Resign. Get out of the way!!! If they don't do what it takes to remove them immediately Congress Republicans,Dem

God Bless Our Military and Veterans
2 Chronicles 7:14"
0,"Your reporting on Australia is in accurate. I am currently in Queensland where there is no Covid 19 and no restrictions, this is the same for many states. Sydney however has had an out break of Covid 19 D the state there is trying to get it under control, thus no large gatherings. The protesters were told not to go, as gatherings spread Covid. They went there with the intent to break the laws. We have been fortunate in Australia to avoid deaths from Covid and are proud to say only a few deaths not 1000s of deaths that followed uncontrolled riots like the US. Perhaps the way fwd would be to tell protesters they are banned from wearing masks then they would protest that by wearing a mask."
2,Sounding more and more like Nazi Germany by the day.
1,"If the video was in black and white, it would mimic a party on a plantation held by the good ole Southern Democratic Segregationist Party!"
1,It gives me the message that it's having trouble playing this video. This is not the first conservative video I have not been able to view on Facebook today. I think they are censoring again.
2,I can‚Äôt believe people still believe any of this show!!!!!! It‚Äôs disgusting and people need to start asking questions!!! Wake up!
2,Vote these people out of office that is how we will take the country back . Get out and vote in your local elections they are more important than we think ......
1,It‚Äôs insane my siblings live in Sweden and are in the medical field they stated they did not have tons off deaths and did not wear masks so again insanity
1,"The hypocrisy has turned into madness, thanks to the left. As usual there are no rules or laws that apply to the ruling class."
2,we all must stand together against any so called ‚Äúruling class‚Äù ‚Ä¶
2,The police in these countries need to turn on there leaders....
2,Nancy seems to be remembering the issues for the 1918 pandemic
1,Unbelievable that they still have Dr. Fauci on TV and people are again hanging on to every word he says. God help us all! Only God can save us now. Keep praying everyone! Evil will not Prevail!!
1,Government officials police and the military are now Australian super spreaders each time they speak they spread covid
2,"For those of us, who had such a hard time understanding of how the german people before ww2, could allow the insane nazis to get into control, now we know!. All it takes for evil to triumphant, is for good people to do NOTHING!. America better wake up, because we are next!. - Mark"
2,"Ok Biden can save hime self.and amercians,, The talaban is not the legt government of afganistan so launch a drone and take out all leaders of taliban and put legt government back in place."
1,Australia has gone full blown communist.
1,"Never, ever give up your guns / weapons."
1,I bet Australians wish they fought to keep their guns years ago.
1,"South Australian here, yea the states under labor control (the leftards or democrats) who have imposed the most ridiculous lock downs and rules ironically have the worst daily case numbers in our country.. im in south Australia, and we are going to work, myself in civil construction, and dont have to mask up unless being inside a shop or the likes.. its the left wing ideology thats proven to be no help, but scare and anger the people.."
0,All good here Ellen is 6 weeks or so we will be 70-80% vaccinated and things should go back to normal. It‚Äôs stressful but at least we don‚Äôt have to look back.
1,"Thank you Tucker for reporting what is happening in NZ & Australia, you are a brave man, may God bless you and keep you always"
1,Only reason the population of Australia put up with a shutdown is Australian government took all the firearms. That is why we need to fight this government and keep them from taking away the second amendment.
2,Notice those in England and Australia who are enforcing these mask mandates and lockdown are not doing the same. No masks on either
2,Tucker it's the same in Ireland üáÆüá™ the elite politicians doing the same but no vaccinated can only dine outdoor.no pass no entrance to be seated in pubs and restaurants
2,This is China all over. CCP. They do the same to their people. Such a huge overlap.
2,"Tucker, don't you know these are all sophisticated, vaccinated people that are all above us servants who are the super spreaders of the world."
2,God help us. People must take control back before this happens to us. I shudder to think what kind of life my grandchildren have to look forward to IF we don‚Äôt stop this insanity NOW!!!!
1,"Have you noticed, if you watch this on utube , it is edited! Why? The pictures are filled in with Donald Trump in the corner, not the videos/ picture of What Tucker is talking about like the Pelosi gathering without masks. Why edited?"
1,We're being conditioned to accept rules for the surfs but not for the elites. That's why they keep throwing it in our faces.
2,I was just going to say that! During Spanish flew everyone covered up. Then WW1 ended and it kinda disappeared. Everyone masked .
2,"They break their own rules every..single..
time. Stand up or this will never end. Please wake up before its too late and we're doing what Australia and New Zealand are doing"
1,Australians getting arrested for going outside
2,"On balance adequate. The footage shot in Australia is illuminating, however; you did not emphasize that the Australians are putting up a fight--American
s are not."
2,"Your life means nothing to them and they will
Kill you just for the heck of it so You Might as well die fighting for freedom of your loved ones and üôèüíûüõêüá∫üá∏ and pray like never before"
2,"Unless your Obama and his guests i presume!!. Or any of the worlds elite, including Johnson and his hypocritical colleagues here in the UK."
2,"Tucker has been vaccinated...he
spewed his venom over that too. He's got nothing else to vomit about. Speaking of servants, how's that silver spoon taste Tucker? Nice name."
1,"Hypocrisy at its finest! they DEMAND of us, doesn‚Äôt apply to them! The thinking of leaving our American boarders WIDE OPEN is an open invitation to thousands more Covid in Texas and elsewhere! Sam Gonzales Lydia Gonzales De Vasquez what are your thoughts? Lisa Cavazos Darras Lisa Daniels Feldman"
2,"And yet nothing happens, evil is ruling, this seems like God's judgment"
2,"I have always thought Australia was one in kind with Canada discounting the weather. We here in Canada have seen similar instances in Toronto and Montreal. My main point is, are the police not there to protect and serve the people? This whole thing, even if there actually is a pandemic why brutalize your own! Nothing about these times follow any kind of straight lines. Rule changes at every turn, they say follow the science without any consultation or debate. Science now is what the government leaders say it is. Having had the illness is the best defence from ever getting it again, but that‚Äôs not very profitable and if they can break down your natural immunity with a few jabs well you might just be the next casualty and that‚Äôs worth a few bucks. To say I‚Äôm dissolutions by what has happened is putting it mildly. Well we will March on."
2,Politicians are famous for hypocrisy. This dingbat is on top of the list.
1,I think we‚Äôre all in denial this is communism. We all need to wake up
2,Didn‚Äôt Australians give up their guns awhile back?
1,"The Australian stuff sounds a lot like life here in Manitoba, until last month! Things are quite normal now, by comparison, but employers and schools are mandating vaccination. Sone of us are quite concerned about how that will play out. I think that just refusing will probably be enough. They can't legally compel us"
1,"FACT Check Tucker Carlson Tonight, ‚ÄúNo one is Australia is laughing at this, no one in Australia is standing back far enough and seeing the lunacy on display‚Äù is incorrect!!! It is a minority but there are many of us who are not happy at all and seeing how crazy Australia has gone! The country of freedom has disappeared and now it‚Äôs communist Australia üá¶üá∫ Very sad‚òπÔ∏è üò¢"
0,"That's funny why Carlson didn't say something when the Governor of Texas, Florida and Atlanta stop wearing mask and you see what is happening. So let's see what will happen."
1,It's because they can't have guns for defense.
2,"Hypocrisy has reached new heights in america and unacceptable.

We do not bow to the politicians who are supposedly elected to serve.

Today's out and have lost their way and believe they are designated through elections to rule.

Time to remove and fire those who believe politicians rule american citizens.

Goes against american tried and true values no matter how many statues antifa and BLM topple"
1,"Peslosi drops her participles. üò¨ üòä On that basis alone she can never be presidential material. Ironically enough, I really do mean this. It only takes a modicum of education. Otherwise one speaks like a fool. üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
0,"Probably exactly the same. See:
Sweden.

Go get vaccinated or mask or whatever or stay home.... and leave me the hell alone to live my life the way I choose to live it."
2,"Here in australia i believe OUR
TRUCKIES are planning a NATIONWIDE stopage within the week. People are preparing for the LONGHAUL stocking up on provisions. As the strike rolls on i sincerely hope they prove to be the much needed thorn in the states sides. We cant go on like this. Its TAKE SERIOUS ACTION OR DIE ON OUR KNEES."
2,The Police can not be trusted anymore. when they know they are breaking the law and they attack citizens they are paid tyrants period. It will all come to a civil war in all of these countries. Its coming sooner than than you think.
2,"Also, in Australia rescue dogs were SHOT & KILLED recently to prevent people from coming to adopt them, & therefore according to the Australian government, risking spreading covid.... He talks about this in this video..."
2,"These elected hypocritical establishment figures all were caught in 2009 with the UBS Bank scandal that exposed them as having 52, 000 bank accounts not paying tax
... Anytime a US politician bureaucrat or elite go to Davos for a climate meeting they're selling influence and profiting in their offshore bank account where nobody can see it."
2,"Tucker, you keep this up and they‚Äôre going to put you in the same box with Trump. She will be tearing up your ‚Äúaddress to the nation‚Äù speech behind your back with clenched dentures."
2,What the hell is going on??? Why would people allow their country to do this???????
1,yes it is pretty bad in Australia at the moment I live in Victoria and in the last year and a half we have been in lockdown for over 200 days prisoners in our own homes you are allowed to go to the shops Within five k‚Äôs for essential items and you are allowed to go to work if you are considered an essential worker it is pretty depressing Feels like I have wasted the last year and a half of my life gotten absolutely nowhere done nothing that is why there was protests over the weekend because a lot of us are about to snap yeah this is not the Australia I grew up in it is hard to watch it‚Äôs not right
2,You know they are going to say they were all vaccinated and they were eating so it‚Äôs okay! üòÜ
2,"So so Terrible Sad! I‚Äôve been to Australia- I love Australia! Well I did, They‚Äôve done lost their minds. So sad for the people of Australia üá¶üá∫"
2,Breach of decorum lol... where's the picture of the forefathers wearing their masks while signing the declaration of independence...
2,"Ah, they have a cure for it they're not giving to the public. Think about it, we all know it's real. Her and the rest of these leaders aren't one bit scared of it. Why not? Why worry about us if they don't worry about themselves?"
2,Hardly a diverse crowd amongst the non help either... not really seeing many border crossers welcome.
2,"The scary thing is, is that here in Australia the media, ALL MSM is demonising the protesters.
They are giving them outrageous negative publicity.
These are the people that are going to save us, not hinder us.
THE PEOPLE ARE BRAINWASHED!"
2,So according to Pelosi all the men at her fund raiser are not real men!!!üòπü§≠
2,"No covid cases so far in the south island, New Zealand yet is still at the level 4 lockdown where only grocery stores, gas stations and hospital emergency services are open. That applies too in the North Island where the covid case was found and spread rapidly within 1 week since the lockdown started. Its the delta variant"
2,"Bandits behind the mask. Better watch out and stay precarious if you are in high crime and hatred state.
Take care of yourself and family. üôèüôèüôè"
1,"Something very evil corrupts these elite puppets thinking and it's dangerously obvious THEY ARE OWNED. Goe Hiden has been on his knees three times?? WHAT IN ""HELL"" HAS ERUPTED??? ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨üêâüêâüêâüêâüêâüêâüêâ"
2,I just don‚Äôt understand how these people get away with lying so much specially right in your face like she just did. How are they getting away with this and not being held responsible that‚Äôs what we need to know??If that was me I‚Äôd be fined or jailed for that.
2,Wow didn't see the people serving wearing masks... I guess I shouldn't be shocked
2,Why not just put their feet down don‚Äôt send them to the collages which also means not giving ANY money to the colleges and they will be in turn shut down can‚Äôt run a college with teachers if no money coming in along with no students to teach ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è makes sense to me
2,Will history repeat itself? Will Americans wake up to the power grabbing of its elected officials and return to making their own informed decisions?
1,"Notice New Zealand is being told that they have learned from other countries around the world that you can get Covid from just walking past somebody. What study did they get that information from? What other country did they learn that from? Or is New Zealanders being lied to?
Each country is telling their people something different to continue the lies fear and control."
1,Australians are ready for Chinese rule
1,And those who don't bring Pelosi ice-cream from her ice-cream fridge will be slaves to her forever.
1,Shame they don‚Äôt have guns. Pretty sure this would he handled very differently if they did.
2,"Please do a story on Washington state before it‚Äôs to late !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!"
1,"As someone has posted, takes more to enter a restaurant than to cross our borders.."
2,"Those in power know what they are doing is nothing less than stripping citizens of their RIGHTS, and if enough stupid people allow it, all will eventually have to submit."
1,"You notice The Prime Minister isn't wearing a mask, one rule for some another rule for others."
1,I believe in the 1918 pandemic that mask mandate was stopped because it was proven that it caused respiratory problems
2,"That is a bit excessive, it's people's stupid fear that allows this to happen"
1,Pelosi should have been required to wear a mask long before the coronavirus ever came along
1,But the mask police will say you can‚Äôt eat or drink with a mask on‚Ä¶
1,He's another communist it's all right and that's the rest of her cohorts including Joe and Pamela Harris.
2,"I agree with Schwarzenegger.
‚ÄúScrew your ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô. Because with freedom comes obligations and responsibilitie
s.‚Äù"
2,Some people in America is doing the same thing. Just going along with these crazies in Washington DC. WHY?
2,"Did the same thing when government banned alcohol, they installed underground cellers under government buildings to hide there booze, hell even had one under white house."
2,WTH tucker??? Where's the Afghanistan coverage????
1,If the ceo of Pfizer won‚Äôt take his own vaccine what does that tell you? If the CDC does not force its employees to take the shot! No one in Biden‚Äôs admin is forced to take the shot! What the hell does that tell you????
1,And people are willing to mask our children... disgusting and evil.
2,Totaliterism at its worst. So sad for the Australian peoples. My people too.
1,You know I don‚Äôt want to share air with palosi either. Can she hold her breath please?
2,"If one is paying attention, they can see the parallels being drawn between Australia and the United States. I fear that by the time Americans decide to do something about it, it will be just as Tucker is saying here - it will be too late."
2,How it should be now. Keep seeing the uppities massless and post all across the nation pics! Then maybe some people will wake up and stop the bah bah like a sheep
1,Saw that last night. She is one of the rich elite Demonrats. Not the peon worker bees like the rest of us.
1,Biden is full of it and why people listen to him is beyond me. 1st off Florida is not full of Covid with people dying left and right. Biden just doesn't like Governor DeSantis!
2,At our local school board meeting last night one father striped down to his undies and mask to make his point. He felt everyone should have to wear a mask. He said if others did not have to wear a mask he did not have to wear clothes.
0,"‚ÄúIf you are not a scientist, and you disagree with scientists about science, it's actually not a disagreement. You're just wrong.‚Äù"
2,"Who does Pelosi think she is Gov. Whitmer from Michigan, None of the rules have applied to her."
1,"Rules for the masses and not for the elite!
Communism, socialism continues, look at all the examples worldwide."
2,"It‚Äôs coming to America, another shut down will be here because you know, it worked the first time!üò†"
2,We must rebel hit the streets just whe the Holiwood dummies got on the streets wearing pink horn hats .Just because Trump was elected .other wise we submit to the political mafia

2,I never laughed so hard in my life but this so called president and his minions come out of a cartoon they need to be impeached and gone.
1,This absolute BS must stop. Arm yourselves because it looks like we are going to need to overthrow our sadistic ‚Äúleaders.‚Äù
2,I think she is joining the president with mental issues and don‚Äôt remember what she says from one min to the next
2,I didn't see one person of color except the servers . Wow talk about a perfect picture of the hypocrisy from the elite
2,"Just say, ""NO"". They can't pass a law that they, themselves aren't subject to. Frauds, the lot of them!"
1,"Wear masks, take the jab, keep social distance, but don't forget the next wave is on its way. Keep it up citizens you are doing well with your communism course. Mind training is hard but you wil get there."
1,First thing I notice is not one person of color at Pelosi's fund raiser. Not one. So tucker ask the Squad why is that.
2,Mark Helmick He speaks of New Zealand's lockdown over 1 covid death and Australian lockdown. Martial law like I have only seen in old military videos.
2,All of her guests are also well into the risk zone age.
2,"Ok for me but not for thee! Control of us peons is the name of their game! When are we going to wise up to their hypocrisy, like the people did in the past!"
1,"What's that old saying what's that old saying do as I say not as I do, what gets me so mad cuz they got all these people coming in on the southern border no mask all these people from Afghanistan no mask and yet their own people they're making mandatory mask üò∑üé≠"
1,Stop arguing about masks and look at HR 4. They‚Äôre trying to take away states rights to require voter ID!
2,"I'm convinced that many of these cops are frustrated schoolyard bullies who couldn't cut it on the playground.

Bear in mind that all these illegal and tyrannical mandates would be pointless and impotent if COPS didn't enforce them. Let that sink in."
1,"This entire Administration is acting like an Aristocracy.
I think they are forgetting what happened to the last one who tried to rule our lives. Remember King George.
If I was a Democratic hippocrate I would be very afraid.
It just took only 75,000 Taliban soldiers to run us out of Afghanistan.
What do you think half the Country could do to Washington if they continue to attempt to rule us like a Monarchy."
1,Thank you Tucker Carlson Tonight for talking about the madness in Australia üôè Next week our truckies are going on protest blocking highways to voice their opinion on mandatory vaxx to cross borders.

2,"I'm Sorry but I have to say something about this sound off of information about our countries leaders about the covid situation and what is in jeopardy here. BUT DID ANYONE ELSE HEAR THE REFERENCE TO THE SERVERS AT THAT $30,000 DOLLAR PLATE SPEACH ??? SOUNDED TO ME LIKE MR. CARLSON TUCKED IN THE WORDS OF "" BROWN SERVERS "" TWICE IN HIS REPORT ON THIS MATTER..
I DON'T MIND HIS REPORTS BUT I BELIEVE THAT HIS REPORTS NEED PROOFREADING BEFORE GOING ON THE AIR.
THIS REPORT WAS GOOD BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER."
2,Why are people not rising up!

1,Here in Victoria Australia we are not allowed to drink alcohol without a mask. Go figure it is not the air but a corporate regime for us to obey the words of the corporate elite nothing more nothing less. Sad really.
2,Australia is a penal colony again.
2,This was a long time coming. The new normally has been brought to you by the Old normal. Repent! Which means think differently.
1,Nor That woman have on a mask.. Why isn't anyone challenging these people. The news media aren't 6ft and none wears a mask inside.. yet not a sound.
1,the Australians made a mistake when they trusted the government and turned over their weapons
2,Repeating history of Nazi Germany... American people need to rise against this tyranny
1,"Im glad Jason Whitlock said it. Im glad someone finally said it. Its ALL satanic. Politics, entertainment, communism, LGBTQ, wokism, marxism; it all flies in the face of Christianity all the while they attack Christians of bigotry while never explaining a single instance. The Left attacks the opposition with the very thing they are doing. As soon as Jason said it, I was like THANK YOU!"
2,"The exact number of taxpayers dollars
85 BILLION in weapons, Aircraft,Unifor

2,"It's a representation of how it's us and them. The workers are wearing masks but the others are too good for that, even though they preach it. They aren't even hiding what they're doing anymore!"
2,"Hey Tucker, love your show but you got it wrong about Aussie bloke sneezing in lift. Remember TYPHOID MARY - they locked her up in isolation for 20 years because she refused to isolate. This bloke is contagious and refuses to quarantine or self isolate. So I have no problem with them locking him up in forced quarantine (comparison to FEMA camps etc is a bit silly, really. It is just 2 weeks isolation which many countries are enforcing, and if he cops a fine or jail term for breaking the law, so what). Yes our Govt is insane, but that's because, unlike most of the world, they are still aiming for ZERO COVID, which is rapidly slipping through their inept fingers. And high school kids were NOT forced to vaccinate without parents in a stadium - it was totally voluntary, and many opted to not vaccinate. There is enough crap going on in the world to expose, without hyping stuff up - it just diminishes your credibility. Disappointed, but still a big fan :)"
1,So why is it the self ordained elites dont wear protection at public venues as Obama & his cronies did at his 60th B-day party on Martha's vineyard recently? What do they know that we dont? Hmm? What the hell is going on? Wake up Americans!
2,Canada is a few weeks away from the same gvt behavior.

1,did that NZ woman just say that the delta variant can be passed on to other people by simply walking next to that person? is she insane? where the hell are those studies everyone believes? no wonder people are scared to even open the window and get this flu....what a bunch of nonsense
2,New Zealand has a bunch of crapNew Zealand and Australia those people are idiots they're scared to death now that's cuz they're

Hmmm is San Francisco reistaling that law? Asking for a friend.
‚ÄòSerious breach of decorum‚Äô ?? Isn‚Äôt that the equivalent of eating a salad with the big fork?!? Everything I ever needed to know about Pelosi can be boiled down to her ‚Äòhair salon‚Äô incident from 2020, where she got caught with her pants down and claimed ‚Äòit was a set up!‚Äô Stick it, Nancy. What a trashy human being.
New Zealand is run by a woke communist its sad
The hipocracy though it's disgusting and appalling is not New or a Surprise!! On the plus side we can be happy they will ALL go down in history as liers, cheaters, hypocrites and crooks!!! My opinion of course.
Love your work Tucker Carlson Tonight but, we have 8 states in Australia, not every state is in lockdown, they like to take it in turns ü§£ currently NSW and Victoria are in lockdown, a couple of other states just have a mask mandate whilst indoors but you are free to move around, as long as you dont want to move around your country as most borders are shut and wont let you in.üôÑ

2,Are media using the word servant on purpose?
2,too far gone America on it's way at warp speed
1,Obama had a Birthday party with possibly 600 guests of the rich and famous type and nobody wore masks. Mandates don't really apply to the elite in the democrat party or to some of their RINO friends because the mask mandate is about having power and control over others. The jews were forced to wear a yellow star on their clothing when outside.
2,"Decorum???
So they admit mandates are purely a matter of ‚Äúgood taste‚Äù, ‚Äúpolite behavior‚Äù, and/
noun
the state or quality of conforming to conventionally accepted standards of behavior or morals.

And has nothing to do with actual necessities??? üòí"
2,They shot rubber bullets point blank range (1m 2m distance) at that demonstration btw

2,Jeff Shortridge. Watch the end of this video where the police turn on Australian citizens. This will be America soon. Don‚Äôt put to much blind faith in the police. Support them but keep an open eye
2,they're at a table outside...who cares..we traveled all over last year..no one cares if your dining out and your at your table.....a stretch to try and stir the pot.....i'm sure you follow every law to the letter....mask and distancing should apply to only to the unvaccinated.
2,"Chaos caused by evil control.
This is all a sham
We will not allow them to take power from us!"
0,but pelosi can have a big party and not wear a mask. am glad that the waiters did because they could have been infected with all her lies

2,Erika Loren what do you have to say about the people you support being so hypocritical? Especially ones in such a high-risk group?

2,"The whole of Australia does not agree with this, trust me we are angry. We do not consent. I am horrified that they killed those dogs. At first I thought it must be a mistake, there must be another reason, but no they killed them to stop people moving between 2 country areas. Heartbreaking. These charges are all dismissed in court too, police were caught on a hot mic admitting that the rules were BS."
1,Australia is just working on getting ahead of the curve in becoming part of Oceania out of Orwell's 1984. Tyranny is cool! ü§¨
2,Don't let Biden or who is running the goverment to touch anything else all he does just withers and dies he is leaving a trail of stink and slug
2,These videos are starting to remind me of news clips off of movies like robocop and v for vendetta etc its so surreal...
2,"They all feel like they rule this country,not work for it"
2,"""the public was able to endure inconvenience, but not hypocrisy"".

It was true then, but not so much today. Fully half this country are sleazy hypocrites. It's not just leaders that you've shown us, I've seen dozens of pictures of liberal friends partying without masks. Recently, when they were publicly chastising people for not wearing them.

I did not hear that the Australian Police State shot and killed dogs merely to stop people from travelling to rescue them That's disgusting, and I know that liberals here would love that. They don't care about dogs, about kids, about race, about anything other than themselves and their own power"
1,now if they want to play this crap ok then what if AMERICA decides too demand this then. if any server serving my food or any one in a store we need too see there papers of any other kind of health issues . cold flu any thing they need papers showing they are either sick or just getting over or other kind of sickness they had or do have.

We haven't had a covid case up this way for quite some time now. Yes down south in New South Wales and Victoria they have gone off the rails, but it's not nation wide."
1,The pictures from the streets looks like Belarus‚Ä¶ Creepy.
2,"I don't care about politics when it comes to health concerns....the
virus is real...it does harm people about 10 time more than the average flu...everyone should decide what's best for themselves. Everyone should also respect one another choices.

2,"The small number of police are able to control these crowds because they single people out and gang up on them like a pride of lions and the rest of the crowd act like gazelle who‚Äôve avoided predation.

The demonstrators need to get organized, focused and predatory in their approach to the police.‚Äù And turn their tactics against them.

By this I don‚Äôt mean do them harm. I mean subdue and neutralize them with restraints then disarm them and let them go."
2,Ohioan here in New Zealand‚Ä¶. He doesn‚Äôt even mention half of it!!!!

These draconian rules are being enforced by the army & the police on the streets. People being asked to report others to Crime Stoppers for breaching COVID rules. This has nothing to do with health, it‚Äôs total control of the masses & we are slowly turning into a Penal Colony and all to force every Australian to get the vaccine whether they want it or not. Threats & fear that we will be refused entry to shops, theatres, sporting events, coffee shops, restaurants etc. This is outrageous, yet the same applies here the Elites are exempt from these rules.
