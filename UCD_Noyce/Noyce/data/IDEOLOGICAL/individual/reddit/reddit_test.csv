1,I’m sure all the people of color who live there and in the south would LOVE that. If Northern Dems actually helped out when the South gets gerrymandered rather than letting it slide (like Obama and Holder did) then maybe things wouldn’t be so shit.
0,We actually need to split the US up again but this time one side fascist the other democrats
0,"I get that this is a joke post, and I’ll have to look for sources to prove this, but the number of dems in the south has been increasing a fair bit recently since the circus of election season."
0,"We aren't as bad as Texas.. Yes half of us are.. Some maybe worse.. But a good half of us are decent. We sometimes go blue like for Obama. 

We have Disney world! And I'm in Tampa with the Bucs, Lightening, and Rays!"
0,"Which would have the effect of kicking out some millions of Latinos and Black Americans, people that tended not to vote for Trump. Hell, Texas is a minority-majority state. You want to abandon your fellow citizens, your fellow Democrats in many cases, rather than fight alongside them? That's not political bravery."
0,They have the 10th largest economy in the world. So they probably would be just fine. And why would you push the Southern democrat states out. The south is why the Dems won the Senate. Georgia baby
2,"Hey Praxis, the Great Lake states want nothing to do with the south, so don't even think about leaving us out."
2,The intellectual basis of the country
2,Texas would be able to self- sustain because of fossil fuels. Rest of the south would go into bankruptcy almost immediately.
0,"Texas isn't even strong enough to sustain itself, let alone subsidize the massively federal-government-dependent red states. Texas came crying to the federal government, begging for federal funds while people were literally freezing to death during their winter storm in February."
2,That’s exactly what the South wanted to do in the Civil War…. Who would want to secede with a war when you can do it peacefully? So pretty much you’re saying Lincoln should have let the Union split.
2,That’s when China Russia seizes the opportunity to attack a divided US
2,"On the one hand, I get the exhaustion of having states that perpetually make life worse for everybody.

On the other, don't say you believe in making things better for everybody while also being okay with people having fascism forced upon them.

If we want to fix shit, we've *got* to fix flyover country.  These people are desperate, and the only people even trying to sell them solutions they understand are doing so in bad faith.  It's why ""reopening the coal mines"" sells so well in West Virginia and Pennsylvania.  It's why trade protectionism plays well in Ohio and Michigan.  They think that imports cost them their jobs, and that coal demand is down because bad people have tried to undermine them--not that coal is simply not worth much anymore.

There are entire regions that have been destroyed economically because the economic viability of their core industries is gone, never to return--but the people who live there don't want to move on."
2,"They can emigrate to the new USA, their choice"
0,"If we can keep making major political gains in Texas and Georgia, then maybe it’d be worth staying on…

BTW, my previous post was (mostly) tongue-in-cheek. ;-)

I don’t actually want to split the nation, but it gets incredibly frustrating when Texas touts their strong, independent cowboy spirit until it all goes wrong (and they come crying for help), and the southern and flyover blocks claim to be true patriots fighting against all welfare and handouts, yet they eat up way more federal funds than they contribute in taxes. 

They simply don’t get to have it both ways anymore. 

If there’s one thing the last 18 months has taught us all, it’s that this level of cultural stupidity has deadly consequences…"
1,"And Republicans won’t ever let Democrats win Georgia again, or any state in the south. 

Or any state they can possibly stop Democrats from winning."
0,I was mostly thinking about crazy farm and corn subsidies given to folks who scream about how the mythical “welfare queens” keep taking all of their supposedly hard-earned money…
0,"Intellectual, cultural, artistic, and financial basis of the country, ever moving forward despite the red anchors constantly dragging us all backwards…"
0,"Until their energy grid crashes, or until everyone quits the crappy-less-than-minimum-wage jobs, or until all the smart people leave in droves and those who stay behind keep catching covid and over-crowding the hospitals.

Oh, wait, all of that is already happening in Texas and across the south under Republican leadership..."
0,Yet try and hook them up to the national power grid to help balance out such extremes and watch them cry foul and fight for some illogical and irrelevant fairy tale of “independence“…
2,"No, because Slavery Is Bad And Needed To Be Stopped. 

But today?

Let’s see if they can survive under their own ideals and with their own money…"
2,"Yes, but who would I sell my house to?  Such a change would cause property in these states to decline precipitously in value."
0,"I’m guessing if all the Democrats left and businesses were left with pretty much zero regulation, it’d all fall apart pretty quickly…"
0,"because moving to another country, a country where you might not have family or friends, is so cheap and easy. the women most effected by anti-abortion laws would be the ones who don't have the money to not get around them. by allowing the South to secede you would only make this problem 10 times worse. if someone can't afford to travel across state lines for a few days to get an abortion if necessary, they probably can't afford to move across international borders."
2,Louisiana has a Dem running the state. The Clinton's came out of Arkansas.
2,What about the fossil fuel subsidies?
2,"Of course they can survive. What interest would the US have in creating a new hostile nation along one of its borders?
You think a nice peaceful split with no issues over land will happen? What if the South wants Virginia or Missouri? What if deep red Indiana wants to join? I’m sure Idaho, Wyoming and Utah and going to want in on the action. What states would the US give up to let them have one connected body of land?"
2,"I understand what you're saying, my point is, like Afganistan, the people of Texas can make changes if they want to. The Afganis had a 300,000 man army and a Govt in place, they let a crazy minority control them, thats why we left, they can't be helped. They won't stand up for their rights. Same with the people of Texas, if the people don't stand up and fight for themselves, then we should allow Texas to leave the US. Its the same principal"
0,"Anyways, it’s helpful if you understand and accept that the Republican Party isn’t interested in democracy, or free and fair elections."
2,"lol. 

Yes, the Clintons came out of Arkansas in 1990. I fail to see how that is at all relevant to 2021. 

North Carolina has a Dem Governor too. 

Doesn’t much matter. 

They’re not going to let democrats take a southern state in a presidential year, ever again."
0,"Yep, kill those too.

Why the hell should we subsidize one of the most profitable and environmentally-damaging industries on the planet?"
0,"I'm sure we could figure something out.

While the North would lose access to the gulf and most of the Mississippi River, we would still have the Atlantic,  the Great Lakes and hopefully a Pacific land bridge from California to the Great Lakes.

Without blue state taxpayer dollars, consumers and tourists, the South's economy would wither on the vine."
0,"See flyover states referenced above…

Many of these states are barely hanging on with federal funds subsidized from the strong blue economies. 

Leave those blue funds to help only blue states, and the reds will crumble even faster than they’re doing now…

Watch the next year or so as Biden’s infrastructure bill starts pumping millions into local economies, and the red states gladly take all that money while unironically calling him sleepy and ineffective and continuing to vote against their own best interests…"
2,It's relevant because the people that voted for them are still there. They didn't follow Bill to DC. Or Hillary to New York. In theory of course. The last time the country split and the south succeeded from the union. The republican party was born under Abe.
1,I guess… collectively they would still be a more resource rich country with a higher GDP than most countries in the world including in Europe because of Texas and Florida
2,"> Many of these states are barely hanging on with federal funds subsidized from the strong blue economies.

Got a source for this?"
0,"I see what you are saying and agree with you about not abandoning the Dems who still live in those states. 

But the Republican Party is, in no way, the Party of Abraham Lincoln any longer. 

They literally worship at the altar of confederate statues. 

They are the Party of Trump. 

If Lincoln were alive today, he would’ve criticized Trump and they would’ve called him a traitor. 

I think we’re either going to have an authoritarian government by 2030, or civil war."
2,"Honestly, I’ve seen the tables and charts a bunch of times. 

Just look up taxes paid versus federal funds distributed by state and find a source that you trust."
0,We shall see. It does seem to be getting worse. Hopefully the trump colt will be gone soon. I'm assuming some of them are decent people who drank the Kool aid. It's like a bad movie
0,"That’s exactly what I’m talking about - the federal funds are spent federally, not (mostly) distributed as budget transfers. They’re spent on the federal social safety net, ie Medicare Medicaid and social security.

That’s not an economic subsidy. It’s federal programs that every American pays into and every American is entitled to draw from. The alternative is that an American worker is less worthy of social security (as a concept) based on where they live, which is stupid frankly. 

Happy to link the Rockefeller institutes research on this topic, which shows exactly what you would expect… that a map of federal spending per capita is identical to a map of per capita elderly Americans, poverty, and disability rates. With some outliers like Virginia having a large amount of federal offices of course, and New Mexico with federal labs."
1,"There's a number of petroleum based products that have no association with combustion nor greenhouse gasses, so despite what some progressives may think, old fossils do have value."
0,"If Texas plans to manage women's sexual health care as well as they're handling a pandemic, we are all in trouble.

There are a lot of good things in Texas culture and history. This is NOT one of them."
0,"Damn straight.  The instant a woman becomes pregnant, if this crap is the law, then she gets child support and support for herself while she’s barfing her guts out.  Disability benefits, whatever she needs.  Forced birth by the sate = pay for it, you mother fuckers."
0,"Now all pregnant women should be allowed to use the carpool lanes in Texas, right?"
0,It’s not a bad idea tbh. And I would go a step further and say if the woman decides to not put the child up for adoption then the man has to pay 50% of child costs for 18 years and if he can’t or won’t he should be sent to federal prison for 18 years instead. No chance of parole
0,"Age should also be measured starting at conception, then. Birthdays are now Conception Days. All human rights apply at six weeks of age. Men who beat their wives or otherwise induce miscarriage will be persecuted for first degree manslaughter in addition to domestic violence charges. Half of all medical costs paid by the father begins at six weeks. They will need to be added to health care coverage plans as well. No need for birth certificates there will now be Conception Identification with only a number until other information is obtained. Can a person legally not have a name? If not- you must be named as soon as conception is confirmed. As a zygote is now *life* a new *possible life* will likely be recognized. As such, male masturbation will be closely monitored and prohibited as it does not occur without external stimulation. Sex without procreative intent will be discouraged and you can bet birth control will be next to go. Any age restricted right will be measured from conception, obviously. The definition of life will need revision. Basic science and the seven characteristics of life no longer apply. So many nonliving things just became living. I’m not sure about this one but if the pregnancy or childbirth kills the mother doesn’t that make the person responsible the fetus? How would that work? Anyways- point is this whole idea is a stupid front for punishing and controlling women. You can bet that the rich will be getting abortions for their wives and the other poor women they knock up. Look- if I get raped and pregnant I’m gonna get put in prison for the abortion anyway so might as well shoot the rapist in the face just sayin."
0,"I don’t think people truly get where this is heading. 

Texas is eventually going to pass a law forbidding a woman from traveling outside the state for an abortion. 

Don’t give me the “they can’t do that line.” 

Haven’t we all learned yet that normal rules and precedent and the constitution no longer apply?

States that ban abortion are going to insist states that allow abortion turn over women who travel there for abortion, and anyone who helps them. 

Either abortion bans become the law throughout all fifty states, or we’re looking at civil war."

0,"It's not just men. My mother wants to punish women, and so do a lot of other women.

A majority of white women voted for Trump in 2016. I haven't bothered to look at the 2020 numbers, maybe someone has.

Doesn't matter: these people got what they wanted out of Trump: three Supreme Court Justices.

And here we are. For at least one generation, and probably more.

Unless young people get off their asses and vote.

Vote every chance you get. Not just every four years. Every single election. It matters."
0,I’ve always said we should take away ED meds and a man’s control over his body since women lose theirs.
2,"Yes, kind of shows how important voting is. I'm in Arkansas, so i cant help."
2,"Only half of the younger eligible voters (younger than boomers) voted in 2016.  And every fucking day they are here and on all social media, hollering about boomers fucking up their lives.  I have been downvoted nonstop for pointing this out, over and over again, that they are doing nothing but bitching about boomers voting.  Seems to me like they simply don’t give a fuck unless they can blame someone else for their circumstances, because they sure as shit aren’t doing anything about it."
0,"Thank you!  I am tired of the sexist attacks on men when both genders have nearly identical views on abortion. Just as many women want to ban abortion as men.

2,"I personally know of three conservative women who had abortions, all years ago, who all vote Republican to ban them, on that one issue alone.   Not one regrets their abortion.  All were married.  Two had their abortions because they were having affairs, one had one because she detested her now ex-husband."

But sorry your mom hates is a douche about this issue. I've done  A LOT of research into females like her and there is a lot of racism around her way of thinking. Yikes. Must have been hard being raised by her."

2,I hate to sound like an alarmist but this reeks of the Nazi era where friends and neighbors were encouraged to tattletale on their loved ones.
0,"The whole concept needs rebranding. ""Critical race theory"" is true American history. We Caucasians have a lot of blood on our hands. Teachers might do well to abandon that label and lose the thought that they are creating revolutionaries and stick to the facts: we stole and abused countless humans, and taught our children to hate and oppress said humans based on the color of their skin, and it took us more than two and a half centuries to begin to address the legacy of violence and hatred we created. Those are facts. 

That, and many of our most notable white inventors were likely to have been on the autism spectrum: Einstein, Tesla, even Jefferson.  If some of the newly minted eductors would ditch the inflammatory rhetoric, quit giving bonus points for protest attendance, stuck to the grim truths of American history, and taught critical thinking instead of trying to piss people off, this country might get somewhere. Instead, we're the laughing stock of the world. Yay us."

0,Basically Critical Race Theory addresses. How Racist Policy promoted Racism in this country to gain power. “CRT” doesn’t say being white is Racist like anything conservative media talking points. You need to draw a line cities like San Francisco and Boston taking to other end by saying meritocracy is racist.
2,"I think it feels a bit more like McCartyism. No one is being killed or imprisoned yet, but they are losing their jobs for no good reason. Either way we should really be combating this nonsense."
2,"CRT is also taught in law school, which most people don't know. Has been since the 70s."
1,"I teach history, I don't teach critical race theory. CRT is not history, CRT comes from the study of law. A good history teacher shares what happened and teaches students how to think critically about what happened. 

The problem we have here is ignorant people trying to change the way we teach history and using CRT as the boogeyman to try to make that happen. They are fascists and like all good fascists, they see the schools as propaganda machines, not educational institutions. So they use scary words to make their followers believe something is wrong and shouldn't be taught. 

I, and all of my co-workers, are ready to be the test case for anyone who wants to challenge what we teach in our classrooms."
2,"I hear your point and would have agreed with the ""be less inflammatory"" part before seeing this site. If you read the quotes they ascribe to teachers, most share something to the effect of what you're saying. Here's the quote from the first teacher from Oklahoma:

> Lawton, OK
> The truth matters. Education should always deal in truth, not mythology, or outright lies. We cannot change the past, but if we learn it accurately, we can find ways for all of us to move forward and create a better future for all Americans."
0,"It's the"" trying to piss people off"" that loses me. It's not about making white people comfortable with fucked up history, otherwise you made valid points"
2,"*""We Caucasians have a lot of blood on our hands""*

I agree with your overall message, but be careful with statements like this.  This only serves to stir up anger and controversy, and derails any chance for constructive dialogue.  

For one, caucasians are way too broad of a group.  You wouldn't say blacks have a lot of blood on their hands after what happened in Rwanda.

Secondly, it's not right to pass the responsibility of a previous generation's actions onto the next.  No one should feel guilt or shame just because of the color of their skin.

The point should be to recognize and accept our history so that we can learn from the mistakes of those that came before us."
0,"No, what they did is worse, they lifted the requirement for teachers to teach the KKK as immoral. 

"
0,"Lol that’s the definition of doxxing. 

I’m just appalled (but not surprised) at the blatant hypocrisy of the right wingers. They claim to hate cancel culture, claim to love small government, and against doxxing. But this is the complete opposite of it."

2,"Again you want comfort. Put another way: You didn't sign the declaration of independence, but you benefit from it. Assuming you're American"
2,"I think I agree with you. You made the point I tried, and failed, to make. Though I'll cop to having reached the point of wanting to cause them a bit of discomfort, I readily concede that said desire is counterproductive at best. Accordingly, I no longer wear clothes bearing  antagonistic messages: I'm a woman stuck in the bible belt, and have been hip-checked by much younger men in the parking lot of Walmart. 

Sad and scary that it's come to this. I very naively hoped that January 2021 would have been the end of the nonsense. I've tried to dial it back, but I don't know how."

You're right though, I didn't sign the Declaration of Independence.  I also didn't invent the automatic transmission, but I benefit from that.  Do I somehow bear responsibility because I benefit?

Assuming you have poor logic skills."
0,"I think it's worse. It's one thing to not teach about the KKK at all, it's another thing to be forced to teach it as a ""neutral"" subject."
2,"Because those who benefit have a responsibility make sure all benefit. Rather than lots of white dudes going, I had nothing to do with it, but I want to enjoy the fruit of that labor"
2,Oh I must have misunderstood the article then. I thought it didn't forbid them from teaching it as immoral. Never mind.
1,"Alright, logical fallacies in your statement aside, the idea that all white people bear responsibility is, in and of itself, racist.  You're trying to assign blame to an entire racial group. 

Getting past that, focusing on blame when trying to solve a problem is not constructive.  What's important is that we all agree there's a problem, and work towards correcting it."
0,"Stop with your faux high-mindedness. Working towards a solution requires truth and reconciliation.
You seem to deny white privilege. Is that correct?
Btw, I didn't say All white dudes are responsible for x, y and z. 
But all inherit privilege. Would you disagree?"
1,"He's right though,  saying white people have blood on their hands because  the actions of people in the past or some people in the present is as racist as assuming black people as a group are responsible for the few black people who commit a disproportionate amount of violent crime, or blaming men for the few who commit a disproportionate amount of rape.

And white privilege  might exist, but the overly simplified heuristic that is used when discussing white privilege deeply flawed. One can't assume that just because  someone is white, they are automatically  privileged. There are so many many variables involved that may increase, decrease, or nullify any actual  privilege that just talking about it in such broad terms of all white people compared to all minorities as privileged or oppressed is completely useless and ultimately causes more conflict than help resolve anything."
0,"I suppose spoon-feeding may help? Lmao 🤣
Look, white privilege isn't always what happens but what doesn't happen to you, because you're automatically assumed to be innocent or not worthy of suspicion, etc.
There is no "" might exist"" It does and is very real. And denying it is also a privilege that a majority are more than willing to accommodate."
2,"The view you hold of white privilege is one I held for a long time.  What it isn't saying is that white people have easy lives or no problems or an automatically easier life than people of color.  Unfortunately, that's how some people talk about it.

I grew up white in a small, poor, rural, farming town.  Lots of meth, lots of poverty, things were bad.  There was a lot of resentment to the idea of white privilege because, as you say, there are lots of levers and dials on how privileged someone is.  

White privilege is the truth that, if one of those people were black, their life would be harder and they would have to deal with more issues than they do currently.  It ISN'T taking away or minimizing what those people are going through.  It is acknowledging race is one of the bigger levers in the equation."
0,"If Elizabeth Warren is making a point about Crypto I'm gonna look it up because for over 15 yrs I've admired and respected her for being one of the few politicians constantly vocal about protecting the personal finance market and consumers from scams, shady business practices, everyday folk."
2,"Cryptocurrencies have no legal basis.  The Constitution places sole authority over currency in Congress - not in Elon Musk, not in some mysterious Japanese man with his Chinese coin mining facility. 

Do you even know why we have devaluation in the dollar?  Do you know how fiat currency actually works and the global coordination of currency markets?  

We had moderate to mild inflation for several decades until Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1970, which crashed the economy throughout the 70s.  Yet, we still managed to have no carry over debt for programs - even Vietnam.  But in the 70s, we started borrowing money like crazy from Japan, to the point where  a minister of education suggested we cede Hawaii to them in exchange for writing off the debt. 

Carter used monetarism to increase inflation significantly which lowered the value of the dollar to repay the Japanese their dollar indexed funds.  This decrease the amount we owed them by billions of dollars.  Yes, stagflation: double digit interest rates, double digit inflation and double digit unemployment.  Short term pain (like 8 years) for long term gain of not carrying foreign debt. 

But Congress couldn't control its spending, and decided to leverage the funds in social security instead.  Throughout the 80s and 90s that's where we borrowed from thus increasing the total debt.  Various members of Congress then opined mightily about the impending crash of Social Security and that it should be privatized, like Chile did.  Except, Chile's program crashed and burned. 

We've been borrowing money for 40 years.   Mysterious, uncontrolled digital currency won't change anything other than create yet another ponzi scheme where the people who get in first, profit and the people who get in late lose money.   With no transparency and no accountability - that's what crypto is: it's a Ponzi scheme."

2,"

Of course do your own due diligence, I too wouldn't have suspected her until I started seeing references to this across many crypto news sites. I'm not saying that regulation doesn't need to be there, I'm just saying doomsayer democrats regarding cryptocurrencies will drive Republicans to take advantage of the narrative as being the ""free financial"" party. Granted, that's probably 10 to 20 years down the road, but politics is always a long game played like it's short."

0,"Anecdotal and a false equivalency.

Just because some people use it criminally does not make it inherently bad for the overall financial system. People money launder, commit fraud and cheat at the stock market all the time using USD fiat.

2,"I don't really care what percentage of democratic or republican I am. I don't subscribe to the idea that I need to be either or. Ultimately you impress upon me the validation for that, with that kind of gatekeeping rhetoric. 

What I am saying, is I watch historical trends and compare them to current events. It might not happen, but the current dialogue of in office political figures is that it's a growing concern and lines in the sand will soon be drawn. What Ultimately will help people who are pro crypto vote for a specific political party is where their stance on crypto is."

But to your point of backing, our current USD isn't backed by anything other than the trust and psychological agreedness that it equals x amount. Money is an arbitrary meaning just like lines in the dirt mean that a country, ""exists"" there. Granted, symbolism is EXTREMELY valuable. Symbolism has been used for great evil and great good. 

My point ultimately is, doomsayers leave room for others to take up the mantle as champions of the crypto space."
2,"That actually isn't correct.  The dollar is backed by the US Government.   It's fiat around the world with more than 20 countries that use it as their currency. 

As one of the dominant currencies in global currency baskets, mismoves by Congress or the Federal Reserve can have catastrophic global consequences.    

About crypto?  Who owns it?  Who oversees it?  Nobody  We see Elon Musk quite reliably pumping Dogecoin with a few weeks at the end of his fiscal quarter, and then dumping it a week after the books close.  

Bitcoin is heavily used by terrorists around the world for ransomware.  The mythical value is the anonymity, yet governments are showing success at seizing wallets used for crime.    Speaking of criminal terrorists, North Korea is one of the leading countries that use crypto for criminal activity.

If you lose all value in your crypto, the way it has happened to many people - who do you deal with to get partial indemnification or a refund?

Nobody.  Nobody.  This is exactly the model that caused multiple financial collapses in the United States from 1830 through 1880.  Five complete financial collapse, bank runs and depressions that lasted for years. 

Because of these collapses, we created the Federal Reserve to oversee currency and debt.  The closest we've come to a collapse was 2008 because of speculative investments.  Sound familiar?  That cost us more than $1 trillion to bring under control.

We have the FDC which exists to oversee financial institutions to protect consumers in the event of a collapse.  No crypto is FDC backed, meaning - a collapse in any crypto leaves it's investors without recourse, and no government backing means they'll never see a cent of it again.

That's why we don't support crypto  It's the subprime mortgage of financial instruments."
2,"My point exactly, USD is backed by the conglomerate agreedness that the US government will catch us if we fall. Just because USD is backed by the government doesn't make it's value any less psychological. 

If I say, my rock is more valuable because 1000 people find it valuable, does it make it any more valuable than the 500 people who think their rock has more value? Inherently no, because they both have psychological value not actually valuable. 

People made the same argument when we made the move away from gold backed USD. A new medium of exchange is necessary for a global economy to evolve. Using the empire of the United states of America as a basis for a financial system globally won't work forever."
2,"Unfortunately this is typical absolutism. The USD is run through every world nation and backed by 20 governments and trillions of dollars, and losses can be compensated.

Crypto *runs* based on wide psychological trust which you try to present as similar, but the scale is not even close. Further, Crypto is not backed by anybody. Lost wallets are not redeemed, stolen data, fraudulent exchanges can not be fought. When Bitcoin had its big early pop and exchanges promised to refund you in their shop's virtual currency rather than dollars, there was nothing you could do."
2,If nobody wanted to value the USD that'd be insane as economies would collapse but in the end the US Treasury would honor it. Not so with your rock.
2,What do you expect. Two of them have been accused of sexually assaulting women.
0,"I like beer….but I don’t like Kavanaugh. I also don’t like religious zealots on our court. 

And that’s without getting into Anita Hill.

That’s three out of the five pictured.

Two of the three are deeply flawed individuals and the third is an evangelical zealot.

Yep… it’s time for a broader representation of our people."
2,These five are a disgrace and betrayed the Constitution they SWORE to uphold. They are scumsucking liars.
0,"Kavanaugh is monumental black eye on the Court. His confirmation hearings, and the investigation that was hampered, eroded my faith in the supreme court. I didn't like the ultra conservatives, but that was fundamental disagreement over policies and morals. Brett kavanaugh perjured himself, I'm not even talking about the allegations of sexual misconduct. I'm talking about his ridiculous answers about his drinking and comments he made when he was a kid. 

The fact that one of nine heads of our entire judicial system, which is premised on getting to the truth and requiring people to tell the truth, would lie and be so evasive during his hearing has eroded my faith in this institution."
2,And one of them is an attempted rapist.
0,I believed Anita Hill.
1,Isn’t the far left a literal accused rapist himself and the bitch next to him was literally a handmaiden to a cult. This is crazy.
2,Two of those are sexual abusers.  The irony.
2,The Supreme Court is no longer credible or respectable as an institution.
0,"Three of the five were nominated by Trump. Next time you* try to tell me that presidential elections don't matter or that both parties are the same, please excuse me when I tell you* that you're* a fucking idiot.

*I mean the royal you, for example people that voted for Jill Stein in 2016."
0,"Agreed.  End the filibuster, pack the court."
2,"Or better yet, term limits on the court."
2," have credible appointed by a rapist

Neat court we have"
2,“Pack the courts” is terrible language politically. Use “reform the courts.”
2,"Fuck Ralph Nadar 

Fuck Justice Kennedy for his bullshit reasons for retiring when he did

Fuck RBG for not retiring when she should have

Fuck Stephen Breyer for being just a selfish

And fuck Jill Stein voters"
2,"Only one of them was appointed by a President who won the popular vote.  Oddly enough under the McConnell rule, that's the one who would never have been seated if Democrats played by the same rules as Republicans."
0,Thomas is one of the figures in modern politics that I have a very strong unwavering dislike for.
0,Let's go...if we don't we are open to the American taliban
0,For a country that prided it self on separation of church and state we sure like to have our church in our state.
0,Four of them were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote
0,Kavanaugh should be impeached for lying under oath repeatedly. Barret shouldn’t be there at all. Democrats screwed the pooch on this and are doing nothing about it.
2,"SERIOUS QUESTION

Doesn't this just open the door for Republicans to dominate legislature and pack the courts when they're in charge?"
2,"Page 9 lines 13 thru 16 specifically say they can not. Laws still bullshit, but at least call it that for reasons it is not false ones."
2,"I read in the statute - rapists aren't allowed to receive the money, but they have to be convicted in order to be disqualified."
0,Balance the court! (...or Repair the Tampering) scans better than 'Pack the Court!'
0,"I will say I think we are lucky Trump decided to appoint Gorsuch rather than a more mainstream conservative- I've been pleasantly surprised by a number of his decision where he bucked the conservative wing of the court and sided with the liberals, mostly when American Indian rights were on the line. Only one of these I have an ounce of respect for despite my disappointment with a number of his other decisions.

With that said we really do need to end the filibuster and expand the court by 2 or so seats, whether permanently or only temporarily as has been done in the past."
0,Welp most are tRump appointees sooooooo raping “never knew her” and “damn it I love beer”
2,"I'm tired of screaming this. It's long past time. 

The SCoTUS does not represent our country. Not the majority. I'm sick over it"
0,They just gave the rape victims a reason for vigilantism.
2,"People keep telling me to end the filibuster. **How?** What can I, as an ordinary citizen, do?"
0,Guys they didn’t make a decision on it. The Texas law will most likely be struck down when it goes through the proper process
0,We must pack the Supreme court.
1,"Yet, Democrats show no willingness to be bold when in power.

Republicans take their minority to execute their vision, enact whatever they can…hold up nominations. Yet, little shits like Manchin bitch and moan about bipartisanship. Wake up you senile POS, bipartisanship only exists when Democrats are in power"
2,This is too kind.   There are some 74 million people in America who favor this outcome.
2,Wow 4 white “educated” individuals and a man who shouldn’t be around a judges seat
2,"Serious question... Doesn't this almost encourage rape?

You rape and have a potential to win 10 grand?"
0,The court's already been packed.  4 of then were appointed by Presidents that lost popular vote.  One of them holds a clearly stolen seat and another violated the dieing wishes of their predecessor.  This court has no legitimacy.  Dems should correct the court.
2,Trump lives with These 5
0,"Is it just me, but does Kavanaugh have a tiny ass mouth compared to his head"
2,"Can anyone site a source? I’ve looked up but I can’t find anything. I’m assuming it’s included in Texas’s new abortion law which outlaws abortions after six weeks, no exceptions."
0,"WTF? I'm irish, and I sometimes can't believe what I see the US do. How backwards do you have to be to introduce a law like this."
2,Just add one justice. Should be enough to stop this bullshit without being accused of packing it to tilt the court.
2,"Wait I know Kavanaugh was accused, who else was?"
0,"A mere 9 people, the majority of whom are right wing religious fascists, representing 330 MILLION is asinine. 

It is beyond time to expand the court. Why aren’t we doing this?!"
2,"The supreme court hasn't been a valid entity since Garland was denied his rightful seat. 

Reset it, reappoint all new justices. 3 must be dems. 3 must be reps, 3 independent

Each party elects their judges when one retires, the president still appoints the independents as is done now"

0,I never thought I’d see a picture of “the majority” (quotes for stolen seats) and be downright embarrassed these clowns represent the highest court in the land.
0,The Supreme Court also defended the internment of people during WW2. They've had a long history of ugly decisions.
0,"I'm old enough to remember when we had a 5-4 liberal majority on the SCOTUS.  It seems so fucking obvious how much the courts matter, but no matter how many times I say it, people just seem to refuse to get it.  I recall in 2016 so many people who didn't like Clinton saying things like, ""Quit trying to hold the court for ransom."""
2,Or didn't vote at all.
2,I will never forgive the Bernie-bro shitheads who (some still to this day) were so convinced HRC would have been “just as bad” as Trump that they didn’t vote for her.
2,"Stop worrying about what bad thing the republicans are gonna do, if they need to do it they will, whether the dems do it first or not. How are people still falling for this?"
0,You also can't sue the woman who had the abortion.  Only those who aided and abetted her.
0,"And considering how infrequently rape is successfully prosecuted, particularly in Texas..."
0,"1.  Volunteer with your local chapter of the Democratic party.  Party planks and platforms are often written by the small number of people who bother to show up.  Having been involved with local democratic politics throughout my teens and early adulthood (I've had to stop since it's considered a conflict of interest with my current job) I can assure you, the people showing up are not always the people we want writing the party platform.  Most the people showing up have big financial interests in getting certain things done.  If we want democracy to work, we need to be more active in it.

2.  Vote in every election, especially at the local level.  The local level has huge influence on your day to day life, your vote carries more weight at the local level, and our next national level candidates have to get their start somewhere.  Voting in every election also means doing your homework.  Get to know the candidates.  For my most recent state delegate primary, I had a chance to talk with both the individuals on the ballot and got a solid feel for both.  It was clear the less funded guy was better to me, but he lost pretty decisively.  So few people do the homework so the woman with the slick mailers won.

3.  Run yourself.  As I already said, democracy only works if we work it.  If the people running aren't getting the job done, then someone else needs to step up.  And frankly, I'd rather vote for the reluctant candidate running to do the right thing than the person who really wants power.  I'm afraid of people who want power.

You'll notice my advice has nothing to do with this particular issue.  That's because if we don't get the foundation right, we will never be able to get the big stuff right.  It's all hard work I propose, no easy answers I fear."

2,"All of reddit is acting like they upheld the law, which isn't what happened"
2,"Reset the court. Mandate 3 Republican, 3 Dem, and 3 Independent judges. 

Each party elects their judges when one retires, the independents get added as they are now by the president"
1,Why do you think that is? Personally I think it’s because the Democratic Party here is designed to be nothing more than controlled opposition
0,It’s already been “Packed” by right wingers. It needs to be unpacked.
2,"Ignore posters like this, only trying to bring down enthusiasm to get out and VOTE!"
2,"Well said. Biden needs to UNPACK the court. They literally just adopt Republican framing and say “no it isn’t” absolutely hopeless. 

Democrats are supposed to be sophisticated and media savvy. Get yourself shit together Democrats.

If Biden added 3 more justices, Democrats would win re-election because of the courage and conviction of the move."
1,Yes no exceptions for rape and incest
2,"

A rapist could collect by suing his victim, as described in this post."
2,And how people feel the need to defend dirtbags like these. Good for you. They're trash. The way they voted proves it.
2,Because they care more about getting reelected.
0,"We don’t officially have a two or three party system. If republicans continue down the road to fascism and sane republicans branch out into a new party, you’re still stuck with fascists on the court and no provisions for the new protestant republicans. 

It also ignores proportions- independents would have a disproportionate representation."
0,"Married to Karen: [ In 2009, Thomas started Liberty Central, a conservative political advocacy nonprofit associated with the Tea Party movement.   
Thomas supported Donald Trump during his presidency, offering his administration recommendations on individuals to hire through her work with the conservative coalition Groundswell. Thomas made an early social media endorsement of the Trump rally that preceded the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol."
1,"I doubt if that pains you otherwise you wouldn't have brought it up. Does it pain you that the African-American community was split on Clarence Thomas with men supporting him and women supporting her? Or that other Democrats voted to confirm Thomas?

Of course not. Your goal was to smear the POTUS."
0,"Agreed. I'm more disgusted than anything. Barrett should have been a judge appointed by Biden. Same with Gorsuch with Obama. The Supreme Court would then be more representative of US. 

These three new judges are just shills for the Republicans."
2,He won't fucking retire while we have the Senate.
2,"That doesn't seem true. 

If they were in the Dems position, would you want them to remove the filibuster and pack the courts?"
2,"Both parties could have removed the filibuster many times. Neither did because of the concerns it raises when they are now in power.

I'm unconvinced they will, but if Dems remove it, they will overrun them entirely when they next have a slim majority."
2,"What stops an out of state telemedicine company simply posting the pills to somebody who wants an abortion?

1,Democratic leaders are doing that on their own. Don’t blame anyone else.
2,"The number of new justices needs to be even, to keep the total odd.

I have no remaining confidence that I can predict why someone would win the presidential election, just the same as I no longer understand what we're disagreeing over or where the center line is."
1,So Democrats are on board with Christo-fascism or is this about the so-called ‘moderates’ and independents? I say fck ‘em. This shit is dead serious. They get re-elected to a fascist country that’s about to do away with elections? Seems like a shortsighted take.
0,"You don't recognize the fascists. Sweep them all under the Republican label and you neuter their worst tendencies.

And just so you know, he was criticized for it back then."
2,"Maybe, but I critique Biden and I'm a supporter. It's healthy to disagree ☺️ n reasonable grounds."
0,"Why is criticism of Biden off limits. The man has made a lot of wrong choices in his career. No one is perfect, and the fact that the African American community was split on Thomas is irrelevant. 

Let’s just hope that Biden makes the right decision now and gets behind the movement to expand the court."
2,This is America- we still get to criticize our electeds
2,Did you sleep through the entire Trump administration? They've already done it.
2,"They refused to even confirm Obama's judges, but when Trump came, they approved judges with a rubber stamp."
2,"Because they didn't need to in order to pack the courts in their favor.  All they had to do was refuse to vote on Obama's elected judges, so they could give them to Trump.

If they'd needed to expand the courts to get them packed, they wouldn't have hesitated."

2,"We have to make it happen. The supreme court was willed into existence extra-constitutionally. We can will it into anything we want with the correct votes. Notably, this will not happen with either party in power pushing their own agenda. It has to be done when the court is evenly split"
2,"Yeah. It seems the party wants to “win” on their terms, only in certain ways they feel is appeasing. It is not good enough to win, they want to win while looking good and having broad communal support and that is simply not possible.

I see it in uber colleagues all the time. They want to win while feeling superior."
2,Haven’t heard a single “democratic leader” say the shit you’re saying.
2,No I'm with you. That was my cynicism speaking before. I mean I just can't think of any reason why the dems wouldn't fill the court with judges when they have complete control if not for their own worry over re-election... To yeah get the moderate and independant votes.
2,You missed the point of the example. If any party loses support and dies due to radicalism they still have huge representation in the court under your proposal.
0,I quite like Biden and I think you’re completely right. We’re not trump supporters who look at the president and think he’s gods gift to our cause. He’s a human and he makes mistakes. Hell Anita Hill herself endorsed him in the last election despite everything that happened back then.
0,"Just so you know, the African-American community was split on the Clarence Thomas nomination. Of course, you didn't mention that Biden and the other Democrats were caught in a difficult situation. You pretend Biden acted unilaterally and alone. Your goal is obvious: to casually smear Joe Biden."
0,"Too bad your claim wasn't reasonable, huh? Odd how you failed to mention that the African-American community was split on the Thomas nomination, huh?

But then your goal was to blame Biden. Mentioning the pressure put on him by African-American men wouldn't serve your purpose, would it?"
1,">Why is criticism of Biden off limits. 

Smears are not criticism. Nice try."
2,"It's not, but I don't exactly see why we need to bring up Biden's role in the Thomas nomination every time we point out what a shit head Thomas is.  It's like we're desperately trying to advance the both sides narrative.  Thomas is objectively worse than Biden in almost every conceivable way, and while Biden has gone on since those hearings to do good things, Thomas has been a thorn in the side of democracy, justice and basic human decency ever since.  

I see no value in flogging Biden at every opportunity for what he did 30 years ago."
2,Your proposal would make congress more extreme on both sides. I don't think it's a good idea.
0,"We're talking about expanding the number of judges. I'm unconvinced Republicans would do that.

They are definitely immoral enough to have coerced Kennedy into retirement with something about his son, though. And they are unamerican enough to not hold a vote on Gorsuch."

0,"I'm actually not convinced of that very last point, but that they practically packed it by not reviewing Gorsuch I do agree. 

I had never seen something so deeply unamerican in my life to that point."
0,"Of course Democrats want to ""win"", that's the whole job of a party and lawmakers. But they need to be strong, and stop pretending the GOP is there to help in good faith."
0,Because they haven’t said shit. They allow Conservatives to continue their bullshit unchecked. We don’t stand a chance because they’ve allowed the wrong people to put pieces in place which allow them to continue spreading lies and stealing and rigging elections. Just like Georgia.

0,"Let’s see if he makes the right choice this time. Like I said, I would hope that he has the guts to take a stance and get behind the push for expanding the court. This Supreme Court is completely broken. It’s a bunch of crazy right wingers with an agenda to undo all of the progress that has been made in the last 100 years. The filibuster is already going to be the reason the dems will loose seats in 2022, and McConnell would have already gotten rid of it if the dems were doing the same thing. In my opinion Biden and the rest of the conservative dems need to grow a pair and get things done, or we are going to loose the country."

1,"Someone needs to tell the Afghans freedom isn’t free. They ought to earn their own freedom through hardship, fight and sacrifice."
2,"You’re absolutely right. The reality in Afghanistan never changed. Both Karzai and Ghani have spent a large amount of the foreign aid to bribe tribal leaders or face their armed resistance. That’s the way Afghanistan runs, plain and simple. Obama should’ve left right after Bin Laden was eliminated and disregard Bush’s rebuilding mission that wasn’t the reason why we went there in the first place. Democracy is something nations have to fully understand and embrace or it’ll fail. The struggle in Rome after the assassination of Julius Caesar boiled down to pro-monarchy versus the supporters of the Republic. Democracy is an everlasting struggle that every generation must fight for."

2,"I agree. Democrats are constantly on their back foot. Democrats are like look at the data, look at the facts, we can save / help / enhance / invest in _______. And that’ll help 90% of Americans. Republicans can drop a meme about Venezuela and socialism and rally 50% of the electorate. Republicans now days appeal to fear of the other, nostalgia, and the base tendencies of their base. Their wins are supported by the remnants of the ‘good Republican’. 

Don’t expect anything to get better. Don’t expect a splinter party of traditional Republicans to emerge in a meaningful way and get the rank and file to ‘come to their senses’. 

The future is a dysfunctional, dystopian mess. Crappy roads, crumbling schools, bigger prisons, the endemic presence of Covid-19, and fewer rights for women and minorities. 

We’re watching the Handmade’s Tale emerge in front of us. Register to vote and show up on Election Day and vote. Make sure that you get your friends to vote!"
2,"I agree, we need aggression and anger in the DNC, but its not in the DNA of most Dems, that's why they're Dems. I'd have an actual reading of the 2nd Amendment. It says you need to be a member of a WELL REGULATED MILITIA to own a gun. Its incredibly Clear. Come on Dems, grow a set and hit back"

0,"Read the whole thing, no periods, all part of the same thought, right of the people to keep and bear arms isn't its own amendment"
1,I have. It's my right to keep and bear arms. Don't like guns? Don't buy one! Don't like abortion? Don't get one! Don't like gay marriage? Marry the opposite sex! Problems solved!

2,"Republicans are one issue voters.

You seem to be more complex than that.

Being called a Democrat in Republican land is a burden, so you don't need to go by that label if it's uncomfortable.

But i can tell you this, you aren't a Republican."
2,It's my observation that people assume the political perspectives of their friends and neighbors.. people are surrounded by Cons? They vote Con..
0,"Republicans want weak government with respect to business i.e. no regulation, unlimited pollution, no worker protections. On the other hand they want strong government with respect to people; so death penalty, control what woman can do, no prevention of police brutality etc."
2,I’d love for you to make this exact same post in the Republican forum.  Get back to us with a summary of their responses.  Should be entertaining.
0,"Given your support for labor unions, regulatory bodies to look out for consumers and helping disadvantaged people, I'd say you lean Democratic."
0,"- you are so mistaken in what republicans are, they LOVE BIG GOVT and massive deficits and taxcuts that lead to record debt,"
0,The US is a two party system and the ideologies have changed over time. At the moment however republicans represent white supremacy and the fear that their power is declining. This ideology is not justifiable in any working society and you see this played out over and over. So to be a democrat at this moment means against that. Unfortunately that is the stark reality.
2,"In my opinion we are all independents. Dem or Republican are labels for the politicians. I like some ideas from both sides or at least I used to. Republicans like to control spending which I agree with. Only I think that spending control should all go toward the defense budget which gop loves to over inflate. 

From the things you said you liked, you are def more Democrat as Republicans actively want all those to go away.they hate unions. Hate regulations. Hate employee protections. Want no min wage. Want no osha. Want people working more hours and less days off. Democrats don't like big govt they think the govt should be there to help people when they need it and protect people when they can. Gop uses that to con people into saying dems want to control our lives. Which is what they want to do while claiming they are getting govt off people backs. Whatever that means. They want high taxes for the middle and lower class and no taxes for the rich. And they are almost all rich themselves while the Democrats have alot of ppl that were part of the working class before getting elected."

2,"Appreciate his bravery but it really is pointless to let your political views be known on liberal echo chambers like Twitter. Sad to see it cost him his job. Dont know much about the video game development world in terms of politics, but hopefully he can find work after this."
2,the more power you give these people the more lives they destroy over political disagreement. pure psychopaths
2,God will provide for this man. Good for him to help spread love and not hate.
2,We have to support people like this. We must provide a soft landing spot for people who get cancelled like this if we ever expect to win the culture war. We cannot continue to just let those brave enough to support our side wither and die when the mob comes after them.
1,So the takeaway is don't have an opinion unless it lines up with the crooked left Nazi Germany.
2,That’s messed up. We are being silenced for anything.
1,"At this point there can't be any reconciliation. The left wants things inherently un American, has a serious lack of morals, and revels in destruction and indoctrination.  Read any subs here about politics or anything for that matter, and Twitter, and see how truly vile the left is. They aren't liberals anymore. They're leftists."
1,That’s terrible I swear these leftist and huge companies are afraid of a issue that shouldn’t be in question. Snowflakes at the finest. Smh
2,"It’s sad that these losers are canceling people for supporting life! 
It’s okay to wish death on people for not being vaccinated though! SMH"
1,Baby killing seems so important to a part of our society
2,So much for freedom of speech.......
2,We need to publicly shame that company which is obviously run by Nazis.
2,This Abortion law has to have an exception for rape victims or underage girls. Otherwise it’ll get taken down.
1,"Remember when almost everyone condemned abortion and being pro-life wasn't controversial. I was called ""edgy"" for supporting this man. No I just didn't throw away my moral compass and still understand the difference between right and wrong. 
  When you're championing the murder of innocents as a sacred right and so happy satanist are trying to protect your cause you might want to try and find that compass.."
2,"I tray don’t appreciate this cancel culture, if we were more open to discussion we could just talk about how bad that Texas law is."
1,"So this is how the left wants us to be - silent or support their views.    That’s how we end up prisoners who are afraid to speak.  
Sounds like Marxism etc.  
we need to grow some gonads."
2,can he sue? Say they discriminated against him on the basis of his beliefs?
2,"Almost every major publisher and studio is extremely liberal so it’s gonna be hard. Even if he makes his own things as an indie developer, this might resurface and he’s gonna get backlash"
2,"Yeah, at that point just keep your mouth shut. Your career is more important than the knowledge *of* your political views."
1,"Exactly, try speaking the truth about anything on the Democrats Sub here and see what happens"
1,The left is happy for you to voice an opinion - as long as it is theirs.
1,More like communist
1,"I wish we as a group got angry enough to start doing that to them. ""Wait, this CEO just shared that if you die of COVID and didn't get the vaccine that it's good? They wished death on these people? We want them fired!""

Not that canceling is good, but maybe if we started doing it to them then they can agree with us and form a majority that frowns upon canceling and maybe it will finally stop."
2,I actually wish this could have waited til after the midterms. I just feel they will use this as their justification for stacking the court. If that happens this country is in for a freefall
1,"No it doesn't. Nor does it have to have ""exceptions for life of the mother"" either. The latter is the only possibly compelling exception and even then it falls flat on its face because in no other realm is failure to medically save (in this case the baby) applicable to murder. 

You cannot fail to save with malice aforethought and despite taking every reasonable action still murder the person. That's just nonsense because the malice aforethought part is contradictory to the actions trying to save another. Doctors aren't perfect and fail to save people all the time and it's not murder. So why would it be any different for the unborn child that you suggest abortion be legal so that they can be killed? It doesn't make sense. Either the child is going to die regardless what you do and you can save the mother, or the child lives and the mother lives.

So no, the law doesn't need to make any exceptions for this. If you murder the child, you should be punished. Period."
2,"> This is a standard across the board for people in tthe public eye who have a company backing them.

Much like actors and actresses, and owners of tech companies."
1,"I agree, but it's incredibly frustrating that if you hold liberal views you're free (and even sometimes rewarded) for being as loud about them as possible.

Company leaders (who inherently represent all working under them) should keep political opinions to themselves regardless of where they fall on the political spectrum, but that condition is currently only half true."
1,So its better that kids be murdered than orphaned? Thats kinda warped..
1,"Nope, it means we don't believe the federal government should get involved and that it should be legislated (or not) by the state.

Learn things."
1,"It's clear you're not a Republican so you can be on your way, now."
1,You don't need to be religious to believe a fetus is a human being.... wtf lol
2,This isn't overreach at all. Even the provision of using the civil courts to enforce it isn't overreach. It does the next best thing possible to calling it murder like it should be and enforcing it by state law enforcement: It puts the enforcement in the hands of the people instead of the state or federal government.
2,Agree but I always ask how are they only 51% of the votes then? Must be rural v urban thing.
1,"Ha it doesnt even need to be a political sub. It could be... About puppy dogs. Someone makes a political comment on a picture of a husky puppy that is related to democratic ideology. You answer with your conervative ideology, you get banned.

I remember getting banned from my hometowns subreddit for a situation like this."
1,"Is there a difference?

Communism, nazism, and fascism are all sister movements of the same leftist socialist ideology."
1,"No one is trying to restrict their bodies. We care about the living, unborn babies inside."
1,I mean c-section is very possible and scary stretch marks would get covered therapy would get covered I’m sorry about it but life is life. Every life should have a dying chance. Or a chance in general. The next bill gates. The next Candace Owens. The next Ron Desantis. Would you like to further more explain why you feel this way?
1,"They still won't get the court packing. They know they'll lose big time if they pack the court. They're already up against the redistricting and the increased security against exploiting mail in voting in several of the swing states they used to put Biden in, the first midterm after a president's first term is the hardest to maintain for the president's party and the president is already in hot water with the whole Afghanistan debacle. Plus if Harris gets 25thed into the white house between now and then, it's even worse because everybody will be coming out to stop her. That's why Biden only did the commission instead of just nominating new justices. Also Pelosi's commission isn't really moving very well. Even the social media platforms, facebook included are starting to regret propping up the democrats because now they want to come after them with regulations not to make them uphold free speech which they were afraid of under Trump, but to censor more than they can handle without hurting their bottom line. Add to that people's weariness with the pandemic and the flipflopping of government officials on what actions need to be taken to mitigate COVID and it looks less and less good for the Democrats.

The US is a shitshow right now."
2,"It does though, It doesn't have rape and incest, which is ick, but it does have a mother's life clause or whatever"
1,"That's because it doesn't actually have to. Failing to save an unborn baby because we're unable to do so is not abortion. That's a miscarriage, even if facilitated by surgery to remove the child from a fallopian tube. The child is guaranteed to die in that case and so it's not murder to save the mother's life by removing the child whole from the mother and allowing that to happen without killing the mother."
0,"Started out very eloquently but kinda did a bit of mental gymnastics there. Thank you for your opinion. So is it safe to say a 13 year old rape victim should follow through with pregnancy even if it kills her?

Edit: spelling"
2,You morons destroyed your coffee machines because they stopped advertising on your favorite tv show.
2,Like 5% of the population actually gives enough of a shit about politics to vote.
1,actually. Nazism isnt a movement. Facist is far right. The only one that is left is communism. Trust me thos f***ing libtards destroy you if you get the facts wrong. I learned the hard way.
0,"Why would a random person care if another random person got an abortion? If they literally never even know that person and had zero intention of helping after baby is born, what business is it of theirs to begin with?

I'm sincerely asking, just trying to understand both sides."
2,"It's no more likely to kill her than an adult woman actually, but regardless, yes. If a medical emergency arises just like in an adult woman, then medical staff should treat both as patients and try to save both."
2,I will vote and I will pay attention to the news but I am done putting the news on a pedestal in my life. Not long ago my day shifted based on how bad the news was and every day it was bad so my days were all bad. Eventually I just decided to leave the room when the news is on and only read off of this subreddit. I’m still keeping my eyes open to the possibilities but now I’m slowing down on the politics. Now i sadly watch my dad fall deeper and deeper into this political hole and lose care for everything.
1,"That is an interesting question and I think you are seeing the statements that conservatives typically make regarding individual liberty (i should be able to make my own decisions because I am free to do so, I just have to deal with the consequences of that decision) and relating it to this issue. Is that the case? I'm sorry if it isn't, that's just the connection that I see and would appreciate clarification if I'm incorrect. 
I think the distinction is that we regard the pregnant woman and the unborn baby as individuals with inherent value simply because they are human. That idea has ramifications. We believe both of those individuals have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. So because the baby is a living individual, it has a right to life and should be provided that as much as we are able. Additionally, the destruction of a life, which we would say begins at conception, at the hands of another is murder, which is something we believe is wrong.
I hope this helps. If you have any more questions or would like to discuss things more, feel free to dm me. I know I'm not always the best at clearly articulating my view, so I would be glad to discuss it further."
2,Wow. And what is your basis for this punishment? Religion?
2,What is your basis for the punishment for murder? Or do you not believe murderers should be punished?
2,"It is encouraging to hear that my response was helpful. Thank you.
I agree that is important to listen to the opposing side. I find i often become arrogantly certain that I am absolutely correct when I either just think through it on my own or only listen to those that agree with me. But hearing the other side often adds perspective or brings up things that I didn't consider. This doesn't always change my position, but it helps me consider more aspects than I originally did which is important to having opinions about the world as a whole and how different things work together."
2,Murder of a human or murder of a fetus?
0,"I get that ""pro-life"" see life at conception, but why not also support adequate sex education and contraceptives instead of abstinence only to prevent unwanted pregnancies, and welfare to help these kids after they are born so the mother doesn't feel like she needs to abort because she has no future?"
2,Just murder. Or rape. Or any crime that should be punished. What is your basis for punishing crime in general?
1,"Thank you for your questions. As before I think those are important questions to ask especially since they can have a big impact on the lives of people involved. 
Would you expand on what sex education would look like? I think I would agree that sex education is important. I don't always agree with how it is put into practice (for example I live in a state that begins sex education in kindergarten. In my opinion that is far too early to begin discussing that topic). So if you clarify what you would desire in that regard, I could give you my opinion in that area. 
In regards to your point on abstinence verses other options, my personal belief is that sex is something reserved for marriage. In holding that view, I acknowledge that others do not hold that view. So I would hold abstinence as the ideal. That's what I believe people should do, but since they aren't going to, providing instruction in the other areas would be beneficial, but I would still emphasize the ideal. I don't believe contraceptives are wrong, I just don't think they are best before marriage. 
I think another reason abstinence is promoted over the other options is that no matter how effective the other options are, there is still a chance that it doesn't work, while with abstinence, it should be entirely effective because if you don't participate in the act that gets you pregnant, you can't get pregnant. Actions have consequences, if you do not want to be pregnant or to deal with a child, the most effective way to prevent that is to avoid participating in the activity that results in pregnancy. If you participate in that activity, you risk the result. 
I don't know that this specifically answers your questing, but one objection I personally would have to welfare being used as a solution is I don't believe it is the government's job to take care of children whose parents would struggle to provide for them. Instead I would say it is the responsibility of the people in that community to come alongside that mother and assist her in the provision and raising of that child. One of the ways this manifests is through charity like Pregnancy Resource Center and individuals seeing the need of that mother and child. 
If a person is truly holding to the pro-life view, they must continue to value the life of that child after they are born and so must be willing to do what it takes to protect that life. The child doesn't cease to be valuable as a human just because they have left the protection of their mother's womb. 
As before I hope I was helpful. If you have any questions or would like clarification, you are welcome to dm me. Thank you for your time."
2,Murdering a frog never got me in jail though. Your analogy is false.

But if someone is a tolerant and nice person, I would be okay with them."
1,There is a reason why that statistic stops at 2014. Happens to be about that time the “centrist” party The Radical Left got in Office and made it illegal to collect ethnic data on violent and sexual offences.
2,white privilege
1,"Republicans are usually opposed to unchecked and illegal immigration, expecting some level of assimilation or cultural affinity before being allowed to enter the country.

2,I Think it shows the impact of Americas Foreign policy in the middle east over the last 20 years on crime stats in Europe.
2,"I think it's, for every 100,000 people who were born in Denmark, 0.7 persons have committed and was convicted of a rape. So for 200k 1.4 was convicted.

For those of Somali origin over 25 have been convicted. This doesn't even include Somalis who were born in Denmark because it's by country of origin"
2,"You're right, probably missing some context, or maybe is the definition of rape that differs"
2,"I wont down vote you yet, I will give you a chance to come up with proof of your claim. Please provide a link to validate that this claim that these stats are faked.  


Also, note that not all, but a lot of times when republicans disagree with stats its because there is a reason to besides they hurt my feelings. Like there are conflicting reports. Like a month or so ago when the CDC said Florida's daily covid death rates where through the roof, but come to find out the CDC had messed up the data and took a 3 day death total and displayed it as happening in 2 days. There were news articles proving this mistake, in that instance, yes republicans disagreed with stats because they were proven wrong.  


On that note I am giving you a chance to prove this wrong.  


But, while these links don't confirm these actual stats they do confirm the sentiment that the refugees from africa and the middle east are causing crime and rape problems in europe.

2,"You are right, in this statistic you need to take into account weather getting that statistic uses a general definition of rape or if it uses it's own countries law or definition of rape which it's actually surprising how laws differ extremely from country to country.

However even if their using the country of origins laws you would still have to wonder why Denmark has a low rape count? Do they have extremely strict laws or are they hiding their cases from us? Does Denmark stack up in comparison to other western countries(where the laws would be somewhat similar, obviously there would be some differences between them all) and would that show us something vastly different in comparison?

Also, if you were to look at the stat through a different lens like ""ohh well Denmark is just more civil"" or something of the sort then suddenly this has a vastly different meaning to what is presented as truth.

In other words, this statistic paints a pretty incomplete picture and it would help if it had something to drive the point home that wasn't itself."
2,"Or they just have less rapes in general. If you only have 2 rapes per 100,000 people, it would end up that you are arresting around 35% of them which is about twice as high as the rate of the US."
2,"Like ostriches sticking their head in the sand. Ignoring the problem doesn't make it go away. They're accomplices if you ask me, they know what will happen and its a price they are willing to pay. It's sick."
2,"Don’t have to imagine, I went to High School in one of the ghettos. 

We sadly don’t have the equivalent of your 2A, but I can help train my daughters to be more trouble than an opportunist is ready for and teach them enough values to recognize who to trust when out."
2,Well for 12 of the past 20 years the US had republican president's...
2,"True, there were no male witnesses and the woman were showing their faces.

not rape, culturally"
2,"I appreciate the opportunity, but I don’t really know, and I never purported to.  I am however, skeptical, and I always am when I see online tables because statistics can be manipulated!  And to this fact, there is no arguing.  There are entire libraries filled with books about how statistics can be misleading and purposefully deceitful.  

To reiterate and be clear, I simply disagreed with the prevailing sentiment and pointed out that statistics can be misleading. I have not done research into this specific instance, and I don’t care to.

As far as statistics being misleading, I am not going to link a bunch of articles you probably won’t read."
2,Less reported rapes* or else the families honor is shot
2,"Yup, in their culture it's not rape, shouldn't be in the same graph. 

Also, we should most likely start going by their laws in order to be inclusive."
1,"Ok, so to be clear, I gave you an opportunity to defend your statement that this table is false. And you essentially refuse to take it, saying you don't care to research the topic and based on your edit only spoke up in defiance of the information because you want to mirror republican behavior.

But like I said, and proved, above. When we disagree we often have evidence to back it up. We don't disagree because the information provided hurt our feelings.

Also you say stats can be and are manipulated. I 100% agree with you. I have an example.

The other day I saw a news clip that said, ""vaccinated people have a 99.999% survival rate. Unvaccinated people are 25 times more likely to die"" that sounds drastic! 99.999% survival rate vs 25 times more likely to die... Let's do that math.

100 - 99.999 = 0.001 (chance of death while vaccinated)

0.001 x 25 = 0.025 (25 times more likely to die while unvaccinated)

100 - 0.025 = 99.975% chance of survival for unvaccinated people.

Yet people are losing careers over vaccine mandates... For a vaccine that doesn't prevent you from contracting or transmitting. It doesn't even prevent you from dying. For an experimental technology (mRNA) that has never gone past lab trials before this year so there is ZERO long term effect studies.

See when republicans reject things, we typically have logic and facts to justify our stance."
2,"No we shouldn't why should we placate a bunch of murdering, terrorist, rapists?"
0,"I was responding to a comment about statistics being xenophobic. I simply stated that was false and foolish and that statistics can be misleading.



Denmark is the fifth most safe country in the world, and while mainstream news admits there are issues in respect to this area,



The reality is that reporting lags behind. I don’t know the reason for this, but since under reporting is rampant, it makes sense that criminal convictions would follow suit.  Instead of blaming a minority, this article describes a traumatizing process as the major issue.



This article expands on how antiquated the laws are, specifically calling for changes to acquaintance rape, the most common type of rape.  

The statistics are misleading because people are using it push a false narrative which blames refugees coming from a particular locality. It fails to account for the realities of the law and the people living there.  In short, statistics are misleading, and some people in this community are pushing their own narrative instead of actually doing the legwork."

1,Fauci was a driving force and had significant input into funding the Wuhan lab...that's why he was soo protective when the virus was released....he's sketchy as hell...why is the US funding a research lab in Wuhan?  China has plenty of money!...is it because Wuhan wouldn't have the oversight/ regulations/ scrutiny that a lab in the US or other free society country would have?
2,Why doesn't this apply to Gen Milley who stated that then President Trump was planning a coup?
2,"Under most circumstances I would agree, however I'm looking at this from a different view. The current administration has become a clear danger to America. There are circumstances under which a military officer is not only justified but also obligated to disobey a legal order
[refusing an order ](

With that said, It's not active duty military we should be depending on to call out the government. 
It's the American people aka private citizens that should be calling them out.
The current administration has become a clear danger to America and its citizens. 

Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) in the Declaration of Independence:

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation….

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.—That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness… it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.****"
2,When poor orders from superiors put life of marines in danger he is within his scope as a LT Col. to speak out. In the troops defense.  Semper fi   LT Col
2,"As a member of the American military, your duty is first and foremost the protection of the American people...even from their own government. He may have broken the rules, but the rules aren’t always right and he remains a hero nonetheless. May he one day walk through parades honoring him and be showered with accolades and medals for having the bravery and courage to do what so few individuals would ever even consider doing. Truly an American hero."
2,What about baby face vindman’s treason?
2,"He didn't even say anything directly aimed at Joe Biden. Listen to the original video. He says he wants ""...accountability from his superiors..."". Where is the contemptuous word in that statement? Shouldn't we ALL want accountability at every level of our armed forces?

I served four years 0311, for those of you who know what that means. Accountability was _huge_ at every level. Why is the Corps today _any_ different?"
1,Biden is a pos
2,Sounds like some North Korean military law or some shit
1,"Who is upvoting the original post? It's a troll post. He simply asked for accountability for the extremely fucked up withdrawal of Americans from Afganistan. Biden didn't even notify NATO of our withdrawal plans. 13 Dead marines. $84 billion of military equipment,  weapons, and vehicles given to terrorists. Taliban going door to door executing Americans and Afgans that helped us. Biden couldn't have fucked it up much worse if he tried."

1,Biden’s an asshole but he’s not that stupid …
2,Pretty sure he just shit on the generals. Not too mention he resigned his commission anyways.
2,Don’t military members swear an oath to the constitution? Would defending it against all enemies foreign or domestic not constitute commanders giving bad orders? Bad orders being ones that get say 13 military killed?
2,Sounds like left politics
2,"Well I'm not a lawyer and I don't much about how corrupt politicians and lawmakers interpret freedom, but I will fight for mine and I doubt I'm the only one. I suppose in the end the winning side will write the futures History and judge the choices we all make."
2,Because he didn't publically say anything. It was written by a reporter without his consent or confirmation. He further reinforced that military is apolitical when questioned on it.
2,Well then you should just get on with your treasonous goal to overthrow the government and quit pussyfooting about.
2,The proper way to speak out is via the chain of command.  I said when his statement went public that he was opening himself up to an Article 88 charge.
2,"None and I apparently know military law better than this guy. 

That's why they gave him a mental health screening because it is such an obvious breaking of the code they wanted to make sure he wasn't mentally ill, just an idiot."
2,Went through proper channels like this prima dona could have - again I don't care about your feelings - I'm telling you how military law is applied
2,Like the the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of a military department type superiors who are also covered? No different from any commissioned officer in any branch so unclear what branch you served in.
2,"Prior to the UCMJ creation in the 1950's, this particular rule was required by military officers even before America was officially a country. In fact, the British had originally adopted it hundreds of years before America was even discovered to keep order and discipline amongst the troops against senior leaders, whether military or civilian government organizations."
2,"Commissioned officers don't, and he knew it when he took the rank and pay.

0,"For sure, to hell with centuries of Military law and precedence.

We got politics to play."
2,I’m sure many in the German Army during the 40’s thought the same.
2,Which is against the code he agreed to follow as a commissioned officer - he could of resigned his commission and then flapped his gums all damn day - he didn't until after he violated the Uniform Code - he even knows he's guilty - and getting damn close to sedition the more he talks
2,"Officers and soldiers are sometimes given bad orders.  They are expected to follow them, regardless.

The exception is orders that are illegal - soldiers are expected to disobey an illegal order - however, they will have to defend doing so in a court martial (though in wartime they might not make it that far).

The issue here is that this Lt. Colonel was not personally given an illegal order, so he had no grounds to disobey one.  At present, we don't know of any other instance where anyone involved was given an illegal order.  We know lots of **stupid** orders were given, but even so, not to this LTC.

What he did was violate the UCMJ, possibly in several particulars.  He will be lucky to not see prison as a result."
2,"So you want every swinging d*ck in the military debating what are good and bad orders and deciding which to obey and ignore?

13 deaths is going to look like nothing when that disfunction hits."
1,"Nope

""Prior to the UCMJ creation in the 1950's, this particular rule was required by military officers even before America was officially a country.""

The Deep State must have been plotting this for a long damn while. The commies were planning this before America even existed 😬"
2,"He has refused to speak about it. When you are misquoted and it can forever taint your reputation you have to vehemently speak out. 
He hasn't.
Silence implies consent. That us the legal standard.
Why are you defending him anyway? He screwed his assignment in Afghanistan and your fellow countrymen will die, and already have, because of his weak leadership.
He will be addressing the Foregin Relations committee, let's see how that goes."
2,"1st of all it would have to be a legitimately elected government before it could be called treason.
 Also I'm not talking about overthrowing anything. 
I simply pointed out legal references to why a military officer could do this, 
And to show how it is the people responsible to speak against this administration so that the military can legally remove them. Who said I'm pussy footing around. Not all of us are scared to speak out."
1,Yeh well sometimes you have to speak your peace.  Fuck political correctness when 13 are dead and biden is a fuck up !
1,"Quite clear you didn’t do military service. 

You complete a mental health exam EVERY year, so don’t buy into he had one because he criticized the president. He completed one because he was required to complete his annual. 

Joe Biden blatantly put marines in danger, despite an abundance of military intelligence without a single doubt telling him exactly what is going to happen months before the Taliban even took Kabul. 

He blatantly disregarded intelligence, armed the Taliban to the teeth so when we inevitably go in next it will be a slaughter, and made one of the worst military decisions possibly any president has made. 

We abandoned our allies, are openly being disrespected across the world, and made this world a lot more dangerous of a place because of his immaturity. 

Or are we going to talk about the blatant disrespect for every dead service member brought home according to a barrage of witnesses’ and gold star families?  

This president is effectively the sole reason for tens of thousands of deaths and ensured many more to come in the future. 

Calling out this administration for the blatant disregard for human life is only right, if he faces jail time so be it, he did the right thing.

The military may not be a “democracy”, but having completely arrogant and disastrous leadership that directly leads to the death of the men you swore to protect under your command, you morally have a right to say something."
2,"Yes, it’s unfortunate how poorly American heroes are compensated."
2,"Yeah I don’t understand, he’s not smart enough to just wait? Like they’re all corrupt we already knew that why throw ur whole career away there’s no honor in it"
1,Bullshit. He actively spied on Trump. Get rekt lib.
1,"No, Bidens approval rating is among the worst of any President in history, and it's because of Afganistan.  Gas prices are doubled. Inflation the highest its been in 40 years. Still millions of Americans out of work because our economy is shit. Democrats extended unemployment way too long and paid bonuses to people too lazy to look for a job. Many businesses closed because they couldn't find workers. 
 So you're full of crap if you think a majority support attacking an honest General that told the truth about Afganistan. Even the deep state leaked Bidens phone call with the Afganistan president asking him to lie about the Taliban having power."
2,The military isn't a democracy.
2,"The German Army has never been under the UCMJ, and the situations are not remotely similar."
2,Just seems people can give orders that result in deaths and get no punishment. Someone speaks against those people who directly caused others to get killed and they go to prison.
0,"He didn't respond because Uniform Code requires him not to speak on political matters which is what he said - I'm not defending him I'm answering a question as to why he is not in violation - when did the GOP become so touchy Feely - he broke the code,  - he's undisciplined - military discipline is crucial to the national defense - end"
2,"T. Jefferson did commit treason - They all did and they knew it - he was explaining why he committed treason to the world hoping for help - that's why Ben Franklin said

We must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.

That is the punishment for treason

Declare your independence and get to fighting. Otherwise 

If you don't love it, leave it 


Merle"
1,It's not political correctness. It military law to maintain order and discipline.
1,"...and when you violate the UCMJ to do so, there can be consequences (unless you are a leftist)."
2,You get to say all that because your not in the military - he doesn't cause he is - he could have resigned and said anything he wanted - he didn't so he violated military law - it ain't about your feelings - it's about maintaining discipline
2,"Yeah that's why I said none. 

Thought it made more sense to work here to build America than nation build in the Middle East.

Interesting timing on his annual ""Schelle acknowledged that he was the one who was forced to undergo a mental health screening after his initial video."""
2,He's was a Lt Col. and I'm not talking about Biden - I'm talking about military discipline - 93 upvotes
2,"No? Immoral or unethical behavior should always be questioned; since you mention UCMJ, I should tell you we are required to disobey unlawful orders and are supposed to question seemingly unethical actions are report them."
2,Yep.  That's how the military works.
2,He could have resigned his commission as an officer and flapped his gums all day with no worries or repercussions - he didn't and violated the law
2,"So you think the only reason this was added to the declaration of independence is because Jefferson was only justifying their actions? I think it was more so those that came after them would know what should be done and create a legal path todo so. I'm sure no lawyer but it seems to be more than justification but a warning to be prepared for future tyranny.

I definitely agree with the love it or leave it part tho. I think more than a few need to have their citizenship revoked and sent out of the country and some should be held accountable for their actions that have lead to our current situation."
1,"What happened to the military officers like Alexander Vindman who not only criticized Trump, he lied under oath for a phony impeachment? He filed a false whistle-blower complaint claiming he heard the Ukraine phone call. He didn't. An Obama holdover Eric Ciara-mella heard the call and used Alexander Vindman as a phony witness. No charges were  given to Vindman even after he was caught lying."
2,"I am in the military and nothing restricts my speech off of duty hours or out of uniform. 

For commissioned officers it is indeed different. My point is there’s a different between morals and laws. 

He was have been limited by law in technically, but morally he had an obligation to defend the honor and the lives of the service members serving under him. 

Countlessly the president and other high appointed officials, military and not do things that are blatantly against the UCMJ and against the law. Almost never do they face repercussions, and even very little do they receive scrutiny, that is as long as it sides with the left viewpoint that almost every corporation sector  and power house in this country supports."
2,The reality of Military service
1,"Correct.  What immoral or unethical order was Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller given, that he had a duty to disobey?

Contrary to leftist belief, *not liking* the President or senior officers does not grant military personnel carte blanche to disobey their lawful orders or act disrespectfully toward them."
2,So you can tell the difference between President and commanding officer?
1,"There is no legal path to overthrow the government.

There is a constitutional system to create laws, judge them and amend the constitution. You should know that as a ""constitutional conservative"".

You advocate something else it's called sedition or treason against our constitutional republic. They make tall trees and short prices of rope for them folks."
2,Then he should have resigned his commission and then complained - citizen presidents don't get court martials bc their not soldiers - who was the last president some country didn't want tried for war crimes - they don't get a fcking opinion - nor does a commissioned officer - period
2,The UCMJ and code of conduct clearly restricts speech of any enlisted or commissioned officer in the military.  You might need a crash course on military law.
2,"No, abandoning our people and actively arming a terrorists organization is plenty of ammunition to question what the hell is going on.  If you can’t even admit that point, I don’t see a reason in continuing this conversation."
2,"Yeah like the the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of a military department who are also covered and who I assume probably had something to do with the withdrawal - it's getting sad now"
2,Do you personally believe the current president and his administration have become a danger to America?
2,So your saying the declaration of independence is nothing but paper or our constitution?
2,"Go ahead and look up the hatch act and DOD Directive 1344.10. 

The UCMJ directly states commissioned officers."
1,"> No, abandoning our people and actively arming a terrorists organization is plenty of ammunition to question what the hell is going on.

It absolutely is.  However, those don't relate to orders Lt. Colonel Scheller was given.

His first video was a violation of Article 88 of the UCMJ.  His second video was a violation of that, and arguably Article 94 also, because it included the statement  ""Follow me, and we will bring the whole [expletive] system down"".  The possible penalties for violation of Article 88 are dismissal, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for one year.  Article 94 has the potential to carry a death penalty.

Biden and the senior officers under his command did a lot of bad things, and they should all spend time in prison.  ...but what Scheller did was dumb."
2,"The declaration of independence was a document explaining why British citizens were overthrowing their government and included specific examples of abuses by the king to justify why they were doing it to gather support from other British subjects living in the colonies and other European powers.

The Constitution was created to create a new constitutional republic to replace a failing confederacy of states. It includes a blue print for how this government should operate and how it can be changed through constitutional amendments. All states ratified this through a vote making it the new law of the land.

The bill of rights were added later through the amendment process established in the constitution because it was the law of the land. 

There is no, we declared independence so you can legally do it whenever you want clause.

Again, you want a revolution prepare to get bloody. And if that's you intention, quit pussy footing around, declare you rebellion and get to fighting"
2,"Well the only thing evil need to spread is for good men to do nothing. 

I would rather find peaceful legal solution. However I won't choose doing nothing while evil destroys our country and the American way of life. 
My family had fought in every war this nation has ever been in from the 1st to the last. I won't be the one to change that. While it scares the hell out of me, I won't comply with what my heart tells me is wrong."
2,"So when does your declaration of independence get released. 

The colonists had 27 abuses and usurpations by the king to justify their treason. Let's start with the abuses and usurpations you feel the Constitutional Republic has completed against you."

2,And In 2020 election
1,At this point a 3rd grader should be able to win against Biden in 2024. They would most certainly do a better job.
2,He beat him in 2020 as well.. badly

1,46% approval in today’s Rasmussen. Really not that bad considering he’s destroyed the country and now another country
1,"Yes - it was not his slogan, but progressive groups who wanted/Team Chaos to take the WH, did use the slogan consistently.  Very easily googled."
1,"Wow, that is actually really sad. ""Settle for Biden"" being a slogan, official or not, is almost terrifying. ""Settle for this guy! We don't like him either, but he's better than the OTHER guy!""

1,It's good to see President Sippy Cup finally getting tough on border control. /s
1,"Biden and Democrats want to believe their lies that everything went okay that they are going to leave Americans to die there. If they helped then it would be acknowledging they messed everything up. 

Democrats strategy appears to be just parrot the propaganda for months and hope people believe your shi$t doesn't stink if you do it long enough."
1,It's possible that all of this was intentional. What if the Americans left behind were Biden's enemies. Biden hands the Taliban their name and addresses and let's the Taliban do his dirty work for him. His enemies are dead. Problem solved. He will take a hit in the polls early on in his administration in the hopes that by 2024 it's all forgotten.
2,"But he said efforts to get people out would be ""ongoing""."
1,Two things Democrats are great at.. supporting death through abortion and abandonment.
1,"The Taliban is holding some outgoing flights for ransom so I would understand if this was a preventative measure, but considering it's the Biden administration, I'm sure that wouldn't be the reasoning."
2,"> Clay received word on Thursday that their flights out of Afghanistan would eventually receive approval following the State Department’s review of their manifest — a task that could take several days even as just the initial 800 names are subjected to the vetting process.

You want 100% of the people in those planes to be vetted, right? If they were all US nationals, this would be different."
2,This clown didn’t kill enough Americans already?
2,"Now now, his policies are specific to certain countries and religions. It may sound hilariously ironic but remember, no mean tweets."
2,So you say you want a revolution....
1,"We do want them vetted. And that can be done while they are held at a more secure facility. Getting them out quickly is a good thing though. 

  We want them vetted like we wanted all of the people on Biden’s planes vetted that were not. We want them vetted like the people crossing his open border that are not."
1,"Not him. His puppet masters. He is the perfect fall guy. The people pulling the strings can take care of Biden's enemies. If caught, the people pulling the strings can blame Biden. He gave the order. If not caught, well it's all gravy."

1,so true. the USA should take note. ugh nvm we got Joe and the hoe running the circus.
0,"Sorry, but this data is completely made up.  Please check the government sites for Sweden and Israel for factual data.  Also, no country is currently on their 3rd shot of vaccine in other than critical care deployments.   This is just designed to rile people up and try to prove a point that isn’t supported by either measured fact or by critical reasoning.  Vaccines work.  Masks work.  Social distancing works.  The USA proved this was effective under both Trump and Biden.  Now we’re suffering again thanks to people spreading these lies.  Viruses mutate.  That’s why we get a different flu vaccine every year.  Covid mutated in the the more aggressive and dangerous Delta variant.  Now people with no defenses, folks who refuse to get vaccinated, are being hit hard.  This sucks and is completely avoidable.  How do I know this.  I’ve got two doctors in my family, both working ICUs.  Both watching people suffer and die.  Direct observation of fact.  Please get vaccinated and end this.

Edit:  As I noted in a follow up comment below, I was looking at the unvaccinated occurrence of infection, not the overall country rate.  But this also bought up the key difference in vaccination between Sweden and Israel.  Sweden is far more vaccinated than Israel is.  Hence lower  Hence relaxation of mask and social distancing.  Vaccinate and wear masks to help protect the unvaccinated."
2,The county we live in has nearly 100% vax participation and the R-eff has been 0.9 for almost two weeks. Mask mandates still in place...
1,I took a lot of heat on arguing that mask mandates don’t work. They’re quite a hive
0," boosters just started so that’s not relevant. 

Look at Sweden’s vaccination rate. Additionally because mask mandates don’t exist doesn’t mean people aren’t wearing masks and distancing because they are.  Nordics take community efforts seriously and usually don’t need to be mandated to do the right thing."
2,"This is really true data, and it’s not a bad two groups to pit against each other, they are both relatively small countries that are mostly homogenous racially, and the only true difference is claimed it (and I do wonder if that has anything to do with it, the Middle East is… Well, desert, and isn’t Sweden fairly cold?)"
1,Mask killed my mom it has no use they just recommend it to us so we vote dems
2,"I’m not antivaxx, but don’t give over 330 million people a vaccine until your positive it works. That’s just common sense"
2,you realize the population is only bigger by 1 million in swedes yet it’s 21x bigger?
1,I'm happy to be in the control group until human trials are over.
2,not to mention sweden is 21x bigger then israel with a slightly similar population
2,"Seems legit to me.  
[Sweden](

[Israel](  

From swedish government:  
  

  

55 in ICU in entire Sweden atm."
2,"Swede here. I live in Stockholm. Hopefully my tourism in this sub will be tolerated. 
 
Practically no one wears mask, if someone does it is almost always old people and they usually wear the good tightly fitted ones. Slightly more people wear on public transport, some put them on just when they travel. Walking in central stockholm, maybe 1 in 100 you see wear mask. Cashiers and working people are some times required to wear one. Mostly people stopped caring.  

[Here is Stockholm, July '21, 600 people [sound]]("
2,"Sweden is also over 10x larger with a significantly higher income population and a similar population size, most of their mandates that restricted public crowding and enforced social distancing were lifted in mid-July. In terms of vaccination, Sweden is at about 60%, and while climate can affect viral transmission, it is likely in large part to Sweden's much lower population density that we see these numbers"
1,Weren't Sturgis and the Trump rallies the superspreader events that didn't happen?
2,"The alternative to facts and knowledge isn’t OK when it comes to a subject, a very communicable disease in this case, that affects people in a community.  If it only affected an individual then do as you like regardless of observable fact and measurement."
0,"You are correct.  I was looking at unvaccinated case rates, not country wide case rates.  That was my mistake and I apologize for the error.  The statistic that’s missing here is the country wide vaccination rate.  Sweden is far ahead of Israel on that which is what’s driving their low case rate

Message stays the same.  Wear a mask.  Get Vaccinated.  If you’re sick, stay away from others.  This is basic healthcare stuff that we’ve known about for several centuries."
1,"They were supposed to be, but it turns out the bigger the crowd of people that don't give a shit, the less reported cases there are. Anyone that got sick probably hung out at home and thought to themselves, "" well shit I'm sick "" then a few days later felt better just like 99% of everyone else that gets this.   They didn't go on national TV and talk about their positive test and how everyone should get vaccinated, so the news is not interested."

0,"What I don't understand and never will is this; if I am dying or at deaths door, what doesn't it matter if I wish or chose to take drug that is considered controversial that could possibly save me? Not just cause of covid, I felt this way before covid."
2,"We don't need more physicians, we fewer liars..."
2,">(of 12) 9 of these patients are now home, and the 10th is rapidly improving

isn't that what happens usually, anyway?

sounds like a job for a medical scientist with a background in statistics, to me"
2,"Doctors have a duty to do no harm, if you wanted lots of pain killers that could stop your breathing and kill you, there’s a limit to what they will give since they can’t practice what would be literal suicide at that point. Also there are laws. In the case of a doctor won’t intubate or use resuscitative measures if you have that signed along with other treatment modalities you can chose to refuse. Plus depending on the drug many have drug-drug interactions that could either enhance or decrease the current efficacy of medications you’re on based on its metabolism. Lastly it’s for prevention of law suits. Let’s say you ask for a bunch of random medication and survive yet have side effects that cause permanent damage or require surgery or other things, now you’ll be suing the hospital. 

Lastly in the case of this tweets correlation doesn’t equal causation. Ivermectin is used to treat parasites. People are buying animal formulations and overdosing themselves, and the media is having a field day calling it medicine. Just like I’ve seen people struggling financially use animal antibiotics and getting deathly sick or using insulin doses for pets. Covid is a virus. Viruses aren’t alive. Just like antibiotics which work on bacteria wouldn’t help in this case, neither would anti fungal medication. 

I also don’t understand why the people who adamantly argue that this virus is a hoax or man made or not that serious and won’t get vaccinated or wear a mask suddenly feel so scared of it that they have to take ivermectin.  

Next thing you know, covid patients are gonna be asking for chemo and radiation to kill everything in their body."
2,"Yes, the hypocrite oath. Yes, assisted suicide is for the most part illegal in the US. I am familiar with DNRs, I used to be a paramedic and worked in a trauma center. Also I am familiar with contraindications when I comes to medication, I was a line Medic in the Army. However, if I was in sound mind and sighed a liability waver or give power of attorney to a family member, thus relasing the attending physician of any and all legal liability prior to my contraction of ANY virus or illness, why not?  The virus is not a hoax but, my job allows me to view certain government materials. The last brief I read was that COVID spread was ""very unlikely"" to be spread naturally. ""More than likely"" leak out the lab, however not meant to be a bio agent. 

I do not believe any virus is a hoax, we have pictures of them. That was not my argument."
2,I mean I support the whole your body your choice thing. I’m only a 4th year medical student so I can’t speak from too much experience yet. I think if the person is willing to pay and like you said of sound mind and judgement and doesn’t hold anyone liable then by all means. But they shouldn’t then go and claim whatever worked for them as a miracle cure without further testing since there are many factors that go into play. And a sample size of 1 is meaningless.
2,"Much respect for being a med sudent!! We need more doctors in this country. You are a 4th year med student you can absolutely speak. Do not think you can not. I don't advocate for for treatments that work worked for me will work for others. I am a big dude. So my doses are usually higher. However, if look at dose to weight ratios you can see why people do things, without the understanding of rNA insulin vs. Synthetic."
2,Yea exactly and thanks I appreciate it. Always nice to have a civil discussion. I’m not a rebuplican or democrat and my views vary depending on the topic but I think we lack the critical thinking and decent these days
2,"Just keep doing good. We all do at some point in life hit a wall of last resorts. I remember in Iraq all my guys wanted morphine and IV. Nope, you got to much blood loss(I'm not tueing your blood in to red Kool aid) and your BP is to low, I'm unsure if you have inter cranial(sp) pressure so I can't, and I don't have anti nausea meds with me.
