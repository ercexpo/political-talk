0,Every conservatives accusation is a confession.
0,Remember when california Republicans put out fake ballot drop boxes to rig an ection? Pepperidge farms remembers.
0,Any time a con claims Dem fraud in elections they are lying or covering up their own fraud.
0,"Interesting that they never ask for recounts in precincts they win.

No fraud there, I guess."
0,"Because they're afraid of losing. This is just their coping mechanism.

Regardless of what the Insurrectionist Party thinks, keep voting no CA."
0,Their calls for a fraudit won't get far in the Dems' veto-proof majorities in the Legislature.
2,Why because we can all actually vote?
0,"The Republican Party has nothing to offer the American people aside from obstruction, hypocrisy, racism, cruelty, treason and childish stupidity."
0,Every GOP accusation in my lifetime has actually been a confession.
0,So fed up with them.  Every Californian who votes NO to this recall in CA has said they do not want any of the bs going on with the Republicans.
1,Real PATRIOT REPUBLICANS need to know that they are just wasting time trying to vote in these RIGGED ELECTIONS!   MAGA needs to PROTEST THE VOTE by staying home and voting where it matters: Facebook MAGA groups.

0,It's only rigged whe Republicans lose
0,"The Big Lie 'was coined by Adolf Hitler, when he dictated his 1925 book Mein Kampf, to describe the use of a lie so colossal that no one would believe that someone ""could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously."" '

0,Well duh they will do that forever now with every single election. It worked it got all the gullible to doubt the system. They can't admit to loss. They are to cowardly and arrogant to admit any fault. Hopeless bunch they are.
0,I remember when the GOP had some dignity.  Now?  Sad.
0,"I wouldn't worry, they probably think that the sun is rigged because it rises in the East instead of the West"
0,"Duh. The moment they think they'll probably lose, they immediately start fabricating fraud. Trump was talking about the ballots being a disaster before anyone even cast a vote. Was he the first president to ever get updates on ""the ballots"" in advance? Well clearly they get a lot of support claiming voter fraud, so this is probably just their new strategy when they don't think they'll win."
0,"I just watched Citizen Kane yesterday (a movie from 1941ish).  The main character who has parallels to the Orange one owns a Newspaper and runs for Governor.  His editor has two headlines ready to go, either ""Kane Wins"" or massive election fraud."
0,"They're not lying. It is rigged. By them. In their favor. 

It's the law of projection. It's strong enough to be used as evidence in a court of law. Anything a republican accuses their opponent of, they are guilty of themselves."
0,"What is that word that was thrown around SO much when Trump won? Not sure I can remember it. SNOWFLAKE.  That‚Äôs it. Yeah, snowflake. Didn‚Äôt the Republicans use that to describe ‚Äúlefties‚Äù who couldn‚Äôt deal with losing?  ‚ÄúDelicate snowflakes‚Äù."
0,If they think it‚Äôs rigged then boycott the election and don‚Äôt vote. üòà
2,Everything they conjecture is impossible.  Take 15 minutes to learn the voting process and you will discover this but they don't even bother.  Ginning up the rubes is much easier to do.
0,"I‚Äôve been watching Meet Kevin‚Äôs campaign, and it does seem like he‚Äôs getting fucked with by Instagram and the state department."
0,Change ‚Äúrigged‚Äù to ‚Äúwe‚Äôre losers‚Äù and you have the GOP narrative going forward.
0,"Beyond being outrageously wrong, this line is starting to sound old and tired, like the Republican base."
0,Well losing is hard. Even when you‚Äôre use to it. Get over it fuck nuts. You lost. Just like trump!
2,We will know in a few days just how rigged it was üòé
0,They never really expected to win. The con was basically to work the Trump angle and rake in a lot of cash from the election outrage. Trump is basically living off the election fraud donations now.
0,One good governor against 50 zombies.
2,They're a lot like BernieBros in that sense.
0,"GOP tranlation = oh crap, we're going to lose again."
2,"Not gonna pretend to be following the current counting but this did happen. 



I won‚Äôt say it will change the outcome but a few hundred here and a few hundred there in bigger elections is very problematic to me."
0,"They know they‚Äôre going to lose. But for them that‚Äôs still a win. They‚Äôre going to be much stronger going into the actual gubernatorial election in 2022 than they would have if they didn‚Äôt do this recall. That‚Äôs the point of the recall. To give them another campaigning and fundraising season before the election next year. 

Normally we wouldn‚Äôt be talking about who the Republican candidates are for governor this far out from the election, but because of the recall, these guys are household names now. They‚Äôve already won at what they were trying to do. Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt win them the office of governor in ‚Äò22"
0,"One of the characteristics of fascism is the public does not believe in the integrity of elections.  This serves fascism's purpose because then people do not vote. So whether they win or lose, casting doubt and trying to rig elections is a win for fascists.  The republican's have said it many times, if everyone was able to vote easily, they would never win another election."
2,Any idea when the riot is planned for?
1,I know they did fake ballot boxes.  But did Pepperidge Farms have something to do with it?
2,"When you used to say 45, I thought of a bad-ass pistol. Now I think whiny-ass loser."
0,"Look up sore  loser in the dictionary and it says:

0,"Really, we should be holding an audit in North Carolina.  Trump told his followers to vote twice there, and [they have a very recent history of GOP ballot tampering]("
1,"It helps if you define illegal immigrant as ""anyone who votes blue."""
0,Good thing California is one of the bluest states in the country.
1,That would show those liberals!
1,The sun is bad is it rises in the East with China. :}
2,It's rigged but they didn't make it so.  Asking a recall and simply putting the guy with the most votes in office is ludicrous and asking for abuse.  The winner should have to get more votes than the Keep votes.
0,They aren't doing it to win. It's just another manufactured scandal to preach to their bas to keep them distracted for all the other bukkshit they are up to.
1,"And we have gotten to a point that no matter what is said, will be repeated mindlessly regardless of fact or even logic. Like woke and cancel culture."
0,At least the Bernie bros don't try to overthrow the government
0,"We'll be ready for 'em.


I mean in the most unfair and ridiculously run recall system ever, if they can't win, they certainly won't get a majority next year."
0,I like Meet Kevin.  I like how he points out how he is beating all the Republicans combined.  This was in the debate anyhow.  Really funny!
2,"There is one planned the dhe 18th. The day after the election in Washington D.C. 

Insurrection 2.0"
0,"Also if they do somehow squeak out a win in the recall, statewide it puts them at a disadvantage in ‚Äò22 because it means they will have a record they will have to defend. Imagine Larry elder trying to defend his record next year, which would undoubtedly be super unpopular. He‚Äôd lose re-election for sure. However, if he wins this recall, it will be good for the GOP nationally because they can push propaganda saying how even ‚Äúcrazy commiefornia‚Äù was fed up with democrats and chose a Republican governor (despite the fact that he can win the recall election without a majority of the state‚Äôs votes). They will use this as evidence to push the party further right and it will help them fundraise in other states, the logic being that if democrats are even too crazy for California, then they‚Äôre clearly too crazy for states like Missouri or Ohio. We really can‚Äôt let that happen. We‚Äôve got to prove to middle America that our candidates are far more reasonable and pragmatic and that the extremists are the republicans"
0,"Sorry, when you suggested Larry Elder winning the recall, I threw up in my mouth  a little.

He could never win in California using conventional means. I think he has other positions in his sight. Her has made a name for himslef amongst the Trumpiest of Trumpets. He will lose here  regardless but unfortunately, we won't have seen the last of this person who was virtually unknown 6 months ago."
2,"His future is definitely something to keep an eye on. From everything I‚Äôve seen from this guy, regardless of his political beliefs, he does not come across as someone who is qualified or ready to become governor tomorrow. He would be a disaster, even if we only have to deal with him for a year and a half, that‚Äôs a year and a half too long. But I expect him to announce his 2022 candidacy for governor very quickly after he loses the recall, and in that election, he‚Äôs going to get a lot of help from establishment republicans across the country, more than he‚Äôs getting now"
0,Oh god no. He is Trump times two. The guy would be a disaster.
0,"He would be awful. Crazy that he‚Äôs the front runner. I thought for sure faulconer would be. Faulconer btw is already running in 2022. So we‚Äôre likely going to see a head to head battle between him and elder next year. Would be cool if they split the vote from each other enough that were able to get two democrats running against each other in the general, but I suspect that elder will have the edge against faulconer judging by how CA republicans are stepping in line behind him"
0,The truth of the matter is abortions will never stop but you can make it safe for people to do so.
0,Go tell that fascist abbott to leave office.  They need to hit Florida next.
2,"I cannot imagine why anyone eligible to vote wouldn‚Äôt register, get involved, and kick these freaking jackasses the hell out of office.  All of them."

2,"As a father of two girls, I cannot possibly be racist. So let me point out that in 2012 that was when one Barrack H Obama was running."
0,But not literally. Texas women should withhold sex until things change.
0,"Texan Women: We have decided to support this new law.
 
GOP: You will? 

Texan Women: Yes. We will ensure no abortion ever gets done by not having sex anymore. Can't have abortions if no one has sex.

But he isn't mentally ill. He's more like a fan of a top sports team that lost and he won't let go of accusing the refs of cheating. 

He had a life changing event by getting past his addiction and seems to have transferred the energy he put into my pillow into Trump. 

I actually pity him."
2,That SCOTUS is not the SCOTUS we have today.
2,Yeah well this SCOTUS doesn‚Äôt seem to be big on precedent.
0,This SCOTUS will side with the anti-vaxxers even if Nipah gets here from India.  Imagine Nipah piggy backing off COVID-19 because of these idiots watch how fast they Darwin themselves from existence and many half or more of the World population with them.
0,"SCOTUS has no business telling women what to do with their bodies. That‚Äôs why they avoided the irony to back abortion without ruling in favor of mask mandate. They can‚Äôt be pro-life when it‚Äôs convenient. BTW, Texas abortion law didn‚Äôt overturn Roe, it‚Äôs only valid in Texas. Other states will have to pass similar laws first, then they‚Äôll be challenged too."
0,"We shall see.  Neither you nor I know how the laws will play out in court. 

The modern GOP is remaking the rules for elections and laws."
0,- current SCOTUS simply doesn;t have to take up any issue that any state passes and by defacto is valid law.  Lower federal courts have been stacked with batshit crazy conservatives so the courts will never be the same until they are cleansed or expanded.

Nihilistic piece of shit neanderthals (fancy way of saying Republicans.)"
0,"Their mothers must be so proud of her children passing this law. Until a grandchild becomes pregnant at 14. The pro life party has proven once again that the only life that matters is the one that can‚Äôt breathe. If you are on EBT benefits, need unemployment insurance, can‚Äôt afford insurance or you get sick enough with covid to die they just don‚Äôt care. Of course, they‚Äôll lie and tell Texans under 21 that all birth control fails and you should save yourself for marriage. We‚Äôve seen how well that‚Äôs working. The simplest thing to do to prevent abortion is to provide free long acting birth control to every woman who wants it. Or to give the guy a vasectomy. Let‚Äôs face it, he can infect more women with pregnancy than one woman can. Worked with a pos one time who was bragging because he had three women pregnant at the same time and on was either twins or triplets. All of whom would be raised on welfare."

0,"Let's think about this...

So a young woman gets pregnant, forced to drop out of school, or at the very least not attend higher level education. Furthermore, she is likely thrust into poverty, as is her child. In the case of the egg holder and sperm donor remaining together, it's likely one of them or both will suffer the same fate.

So, which political party do you think they will be shamed into?"

0,Larry Elder is the best thing that happened to Newsom.

2,"The thing is, people were always this stupid. Hell, they were probably stupider. But 20 years ago we didn‚Äôt have to hear about ALL the stupid people in the world. So it wasn‚Äôt as overwhelming. I‚Äôm convinced this exposure to the stupid is what makes us all anxious and tired as hell."
2,The stupid have a national soapbox now. The invention of the news cycle is going to be the death of us all. They run out of real news and just air opinion pieces to fill the time and boost ratings. Meanwhile the stupid don't realize it's just an opinion with no facts to back it up and they run with it.
0,"100% predictable as GQP got caught up in themselves. Was no smart move by Pelosi BUT the expected one she or any Majority leader would do and even then she initially allowed McCarthy to place members of his choosing and all he did was pick the biggest liars he had...and then was called out and he did the EXPECTED thing and took his ball hom,e, and then Pelosi outsmarted McCarthy once again with naming Liz Cheney and Adam  Kinzinger to the hearing. Not going to work out well for GQP.   Now the GQP will have to sit back and watch with no way to offer their lies in front of the American people as committee members who will be glued to the hearings, especially when 6-12 GQP are forced to plead the 5th on their participation and efforts. on TV in front of the world. NOPE, not going as expected. GQP can gaslight their easily led followers, but not the rest of America or the world"
0,"For these hearings to have maximum impact they're eventually going to have to take advantage of television the way the Kefauver and Watergate hearings did. Put McCarthy, Jordan, and the other traitors, under the hot lights and under oath. The country needs to understand this was an attempted coup and these people were complicit."
0,"On TV in front of only those who care to watch. We already know Faux, Oann, and Newsmax filter out reality to protect their turf."
2,"Absolutely‚Ä¶.not only that? This is where recommendations should arise about OPINION should be 180 degree opposed from actual news.

Because OPINION pieces have virtually replaced actual news these days. The worst violators are the right wingers, but the left is not innocent.

0,"Vote like our lives depend on it!! Because if the GQP wins these next few elections, we‚Äôre all targets."
0,I voted NO against the GQP's power grab and got my confirmation!
0,I voted No!  And mailed it.  The recall election needs to be voted.  It's a fascist attempt to circumvent democracy by the GQP.  VOTE NO!  Keep our democratically elected governor.
0,"I voted!!!  

Fellow Californians:  the ballot is right there on your dining room table or wherever you put your mail.  Open it, vote NO, then drop the ballot off in the mail or at a ballot drop box.  There are ballot drop boxes all over the place and outside every library branch!  

Do it NOW--we only have a week! 

This REALLY MATTERS.   We have Republican chaos agents, running a terrible, anti-vaccine, misogynist, anti-voting rights candidate named Larry Elder, he's leading, and the way this stupid recall is set up, he could become governor if we DON'T VOTE.  

VOTE!!!!!"
0,I moved to CA July 29 and the first thing I did was register to vote. Dropped my ballot in the mailbox earlier today. Fuck the CA GOP
0,"Make sure you choose a candidate, even though you're voting 'no'. There is a possibility that they win the recall, so vote for Dem to replace Gavin along with a 'no' vote on the recall."
0,"Already in and accounted for. Voted NO. 

If your curious about tracking your your ballot,

Ballottrax"
2,"If I lived in California, I'd be walking up to strangers saying, ""Governor Larry Elder?! Imagine that?"""
2,"Please, please vote No."
0,"To be cautious, I heard that even if you vote NO to the recall, you should also list a candidate you want if the recall succeeds. Cover all your bases, or you could end up with a Republican candidate who got to be governor with only a tiny fraction of the vote."
2,"If l could l would vote, but until then l must just engage in debate with those who voted for a candidate who wants slavery, and environmental destruction."
0,I voted.  This Elder person is an idiot.
1,I did. Dems are lazy voters so my fingers are crossed.
2,I‚Äôm from MN.  Can someone tell me what the vote is on?
0,Me and my wife read the candidate booklet. We were horrified. Gavin needs to stay otherwise California is fucked.
0,"And tell a friend (or 5)! And tell them to tell their friends!

I‚Äôm dying bc I was always the Californian phonebanking to swing states because ‚ÄúCA is so blue already.‚Äù I just moved out of state, and now there‚Äôs a frighteningly dire election in CA. üòí I‚Äôm trying to rally my people, though! Good luck, Cali. Sending love. üíôüíôüíô"
2,"After this mess, can CA use it's super majority to finally change the foolishly low bar for recall elections or place this as a ballot initiative because this is ridiculous and a waste of resources. 

What's the point of having a super majority if you can't even start the process of reforming such a foolish process."
2,Did mine like a week ago. Already got a text my ballot has been received!
2,I was riding through an affluent neighborhood and was astounded by the amount of Yes signs. Cemented my resolve to stand up
0,Only about 25% of CA voters are registered Republican so shouldn't be a problem.
2,100% done already!!! The second I got that ballot!
2,Sounds like your trying to influence an election by telling people how to vote. Why not just say go vote and let the people decide who to vote for?
0,"I told a friend about it today. They said they weren't going to vote but decided to vote when I explained to them what was at stake. In fact, they threw their ballot in the trash and had to dig it out! 

I'm glad they voted, but our fellow democrats need to be a little more active. Hell, the democratic messaging needs to change to and stress the urgency here."
0,"I would think so but they are not pushing that. 

Kevin Paffrath is the top democrat contender  but lags far behind Elder. 

I just don't understand why they are not pushing for people to  vote them dem just in case."
2,Very curious on which candidate is wanting slavery
2,He is like a Jewish Nazi
2,"I don't know about lazy... we have a higher proportion of individuals either prevented from voting, or for whom voting is more difficult."
0,"In California, a recall election can be put into motion solely by getting a petition signed by a proportion of state citizens equal to or greater than 12% of the number of voters in the previous office election. As such, to force a recall election of Gavin Newsom--who won with 62% of the vote in 2018--only required 1.4 million signatures, or 3.5% of California's population. The recall is costing California $276 million and represents an attempted power grab by Republicans to take advantage of a non-regular election to unseat the democratically-elected governor.

According to the law, the recall is based on two questions: question one is a yes or no question about recalling Gavin Newsom, and question two is who would replace him were the yes vote to receive a plurality of the vote. So, technically, 3.5% of the population forces the other 96.5% to turn out in an irregular election to vote ""no"" by a plurality, or the most popular ""other"" candidate running (currently Republican Larry Elder with about 26% popularity) becomes governor. If a plurality votes ""yes,"" regardless of who they prefer, a candidate with less than 30% popularity can supplant the governor elected with over twice that popularity during a standard, regular election."
2,Yeah but they‚Äôre more motivated to turn out than the Democratic voters :/
0,You're on a democratic party sub mate... I don't think anyone here will be influenced very heavily by this...
0,"Recall laws in California are very lax.   


Only 65 signatures need to start the drive to recall and only 12% of the total votes counted in the last election needed for the recall to proceed. FWIW, Newsom beat his last opponent by 24%. However at 12.5 million votes cast, only 1.5 million needed for a recall to proceed. It gives the GOP a second bite at every election if they choose to take it. Seriously broken.  


I urge all California, left, right and center, not to sit this one out."
0,"The reason they got 12% of voters to sign is because Covid extended their time to get signatures by 3 months. So they simultaneously bitch about Covid measures and owe it to Covid measures that they got a recall at all. 

12% of voters shouldn't be able to waste the time of the other 88% with this bullshit."
0,"You are amazing for doing this. Is there anyone else you can call? You seem to be a trusted voice of reason. 

&x200B;

This also reminds me of Nov. 4th. I had to call my aunt the day before to ask her if she is voting. She wasn't going to because my cousin (her daughter) always goes with her but had to work. I told her I'll stay on the phone with her while she waits in line, thank goodness I was working from home halfway across the country. So I listened to her random stories for an hour after calling 3 times to get her out of the house to the polls and sending her the polling location. 

She lives in NV so it was 100% worth the effort to get another vote for Biden. Then i convinced my exhausted cousin to stop at her polling place after pulling a double at work. +2 votes for Biden in NV! 

Seeing how close NV was warmed my heart for my little cross country voter outreach."
2,"Wow, you're amazing!  That's so great!  We all need to do this!  Thanks for being a good citizen!"
2,"Because campaigning on the importance of No is that important.

Last time they lost during the recall, in part, because they promoted a candidate"
0,The black Trump    - The guy is the equivalent of a Jewish Nazi.
2,You Mean to tell me that in California a blue state that‚Äôs been blue for a long time that has some of the loosest voting laws in the country is disproportionally making it harder for blue voters to vote? You have even said everyone has a ballot MAILED to them. And you have plenty of places to vote. Tell me how is it hard to vote? It almost seems hard not to vote yet you are convinced it is still hard for people? Which people are disproportionately affected? I genuinely want to know.
0,I‚Äôve been telling my friends like crazy. Some ignore me but get through to some. My friend told me that they didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal. I hope people turn out in drones because every Republican is surely going to vote yes on the recall.
2,"You mean to tell me, that an intelligent black man, is pushing for slavery and white supremacy. Lmao what"
0,He wants to get rid of the minimum wage... what do you call allowing employers to not pay a minimum amount other than sanctioning the potential for slavery? Gtfo wannabe-troll.

No minimum wage. He's said we should give reparations to the families of slave owners for their lost property (slaves)"
2,Yes the Jewish nazi
0,"With Elder as the alternative, slam dunk for the Dems, should be embarrassing for the GOP"
0,"Those Govenors bear some responsibility.

We cannot blame the Federal government, we blame the 70 million selfish rural Trumpers who refuse to get vaccinated and shed the virus to innocents. Now the kids are dying.

This is squarely the fault of self-centered conservatives who back the big lie. Now they are in the hospital begging for help.

They should be shamed off the planet and Republicans must all be beaten in 2022."
0,"Vaccines for kids, yes. Boosters for immune compromised, the elderly etc, yes. But beyond that, we really need to start sending hundreds of millions of doses overseas. We really need to get global COVID cases under control, all those open the door for new mutations, any one of which could end up being fully resistant, sending us right back to square one."
0,"I got the J&J vaccine, got the delta variant and it I was only kinda sick for a day it was like a bad head cold, so glad I got the shot."
0,I haven‚Äôt had any empathy for the voluntarily unvaccinated for months.  I‚Äôm just sorry that precious hospital resources are being spent on them.
2,"Spend a little time here and it may, unfortunately, deplete any empathy in the most empathetic of people. [

Over and over and over it's the same thing. Past posts from people saying it's about control or freedom or whatever nonsense of the day, followed by the hospitalization and call for ""Prayer Warriors,"" then the death announcement followed by the standard Go Fund Me page. Mind blowing.

It's the Dad's leaving kids behind that's really hard for me take. Can't wrap my head around it."
0,Biden is a gentle transparent decent man. He is a refreshing change. We are lucky to have him now.
2,The administration could do a MUCH BETTER job of squelching misinformation. Why don't they?
0,"I'd agree with you but for the fact that so many of our people are still unvaccinated and chances of new variants developing are high. 

So boosters first for us since studies are showing that it really boosts our protections. Then by all means protect the world because unless everyone is vaccinated, we're not safe. It can spread again as it did the first time."
0,"No sympathy. 

They should all sign a waiver saying they will voluntarily forgo a hospital bed in the event they get sick. Selfish self centered people that then go infect unsuspecting good people."
2,"They seem to be having a hands off plan for misinformation. I don't blame them because it would be risky, constitutionally. 

But Facebook and Twitter are worth hundreds of billions of dollars and are doing nothing about, which is a disgrace."
2,"Because they can't. And that's because EVERYTHING that comes out of their mouths is a ""lie"" to the brainwashed. It's an unwinnable situation."
0,"The misinformation comes mostly from 2 sources

- conservative politicians and snake oil media personalities such as Tacky Carlson

- private social media companies

&x200B;

What do you propose the administration do to squelch the above?"
2,"I work in a grocery store so I likely got it there, a couple days prior multiple employees got sick and missed 14 days of work. We had to shut down out deli and pizza station and got a visit from the health department. We had mandate masks again all staff."
0,"That will never happen.  Those jerks will run to the hospital as soon as they realize that COVID is real, when they can‚Äôt freaking breathe."
0,"That is a stupid and non-credible thing to say.

How can you even say things like that after 4 years of lies and cheating from the Trump Administration?"
0,"Fair point. Well Murthi and others could make a stronger counter-point by counter-point during press conferences. That's all I meant. 
They have the bully pulpit after all, use it to overcome! They do it in interviews if asked. And poor Dr. Fauci. He is trying to do it all by.himself poor fellow! I just want to give the man a hug!"

2,I wonder what would happen if we got the money out of politics.
0,Watch Republicans slam companies for not supporting this for being ‚Äúwoke‚Äù.
2,"While corporate money in politics can be considered bribery, most of it is legal in the US. Many of these companies will fund anyone on committees that oversee their particular market, so just about every congressman, state or federal, gets political donations from big corporations, and if they are committee chairs or get lots of press, they get more, regardless of political affiliation, as long as that corporation feels they can expect preferential treatment access. Every bill is backed by congressmen who take corporate money. I doubt AT&T is donating to ban abortion specifically, they are likely donating to many state and federal-level stooges hoping they will regulate their industry in AT&T's favor. If those stooges also happen to be right-wing jack-asses? AT&T probably doesn't care."

0,GQP has NO intention in raising the debt limit. So just be prepared for that outcome
0,- unless the debt ceiling is raisedand ONLY congress can do that. its will be a disaster as GQP has ZERO interest in doing so. Let the chips fall asathey do with first chips?  Perhaps reducing govt payment of all types to redstates and redstate citizens.  ITs war so lets start responding in kind
0,"Republicans are still trying to sabotage Biden through a laughable debt ceiling. Please ask anyone of them, if they have any debt ceiling in regards to their personal finances? I didn‚Äôt hear talks of debt ceiling from republicans when Trump drove the economy to the ground with a mega deficit. Another laughable republican economic plan is their so-called ‚Äútrickle down economy‚Äù, a Koch backed theory that the rich shouldn‚Äôt be taxed as it tends to hurt the economy. If republicans truly cared for the economy, they wouldn‚Äôt give tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations. Neither would they try to recall Newsom, whom despite the long lasting effects of the pandemic on the nation was able to balance California‚Äôs economy with a surplus."

0,I wonder if one of their motivations in passing these regressive laws is to drive out liberals and moderates from their state in an attempt to combat the possibility of changing demographics turning their states from red to purple and eventually blue.
0,"Perhaps. 

Thing is though, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin all are majority liberal cities. They get around that by the politicians picking the voters, not the voters picking the politicians.  Texas gerrymanders the hell out of districts to keep it red and there has always been complaints of election fraud that never go anywhere.  

The crew that is in charge now are corrupt AF.  Ken Paxton has been indicted for several felonies while he has been AG but he always slithers his way out. Dan Patrick used to be a big coke head and Abbott is just a cronies crony.  They have managed to completely fuck up that state."

1,"Unions, AKA the *Democratic Establishment.*  (Also little old Black ladies.)"
0,"I'm worried too, but for this it's not really that California Republicans are gaining momentum. It's solely because of the idiotic rules for recall elections where someone can replace a slightly unpopular governor with a tiny minority of the vote."
0,"Totally agree.  When I saw the recall effort initially, I just laughed it off as more GQP fuckery.  

I just can't believe there are really that many people in CA that are in support of this.  Really not a good thing going into the midterms."
1,It's not hard. But some Democrats are disgustingly apathetic and I can't understand why. Why we're still playing games is beyond me.
0,"To be fair, it's really only in danger of happening in California due to their absolutely idiotic format for recall elections. Otherwise, Republicans would literally never be able to elect a governor."
2,Not Canada! That was supposed to be my safe haven for when everything in America  went to crap.
0,Yeah. It's too easy to unseat a governor who is only having a slight dip in popularity or if there is a motivated minority voting in a low turnout election. Plus the way that the replacement is selected produces a new governor with nothing near a popular mandate.
0,Isn't PG&E being held liable for for tens of billions of dollars in damages? Blaming that on Newsom seems like misplaced blame.
0,"No. Paffrath is polling at only 10%.

Good luck holding PG&E accountable when a crazy Republican is in power in CA."
0,"Are you referring to the PG&E settlement? I'm no fan of PG&E, but forcing the largest utility in America into a punitive bankruptcy wouldn't have helped anyone. The simple truth is that PG&E took our money for years and left us with shit infrastructure and we should be enraged at that, but we can't get blood from a turnip. 

Don't retcon the reason for the recall election to be all about the PG&E settlement. The recall was started by a racist, anti-vaxx former sheriff of Yolo County, who coincidentally was just diagnosed with COVID. It is fundamentally undemocratic to allow 12% of the electorate to replace a popularly elected governor. It might be legal for now, but that doesn't make it right."
0,This is why republicans are always trying to recall the governor. It's much easier than winning an actual election.
0,It's not democrats that are apathetic.

0,It is misplaced blame.  Trump withheld federal emergency funds and his arsonist supporters lit the federal land national forest on fire in 2018. It's trump's fault.
0,I don't vote republican
1,"Yeah, but they *probably* wouldn't have gotten this one off the ground if Newsom was less of an arrogant jackass - e.g., violating his own Covid restrictions and declining to send his lawyers to challenge the deadline extension so as to not ""legitimize it"". So he shares some blame, but still far better than the alternative."
2,The cartels are pretty terrifying. How does New Zealand sound?
2,"I appreciate this sentiment, but people loudly complain about him going to an elite dinner party which was in a semi outdoors area wasn't really breaking his own restrictions.  It was a grey area.  But that isn't import because if it wasn't this it would have been anything else.  Enough people hated the restrictions that they would sign for a recall regardless and just parrot whatever rhetoric they choose."
2,"It‚Äôs all optics.  Democrats and Republicans are in an asymmetrical optics battle.  They constantly trounce us with this because democrats will punish their own for missteps, while republicans won‚Äôt.

They constantly complain about minor minimum wage increases causing inflation and higher prices for goods and services, not considering that executive salaries and shareholder profits are the actual problem. 

I'm CONSTANTLY telling people on Facebook that they're not going to pay $20 for a Big Mac if Billy Bob makes $7.45 instead of $7.25 for flipping burgers. Then I ask them if they're interested in seeing the quarterly shareholder report."

From there it's gotten more twisted. 

Ironically, the right and left DO share a common enemy. And if both sets of eyes were on the ball, things would change. Won't happen though. I think it's too deeply ingrained."
0,"This happens regularly in any other advanced economy though? UK, Australia, Norway, New Zealand etc etc. So you can do it.

 they then go an vote against their own interests under fear of economic collapse cos minimum wage workers got paid an extra few dollars an hour lol. 

I worked out the other day, Jeff Bezos worth today 200bil (well few days ago) could pay all 798 000 Amazon staff himself for the next 8 years until he runs out of money.

When you make 40k, for example, and think that you are in the same league as Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson, you have officially become certifiable. Imo.

If one is so wrong surely it wouldn't be hard, certainly if you acknowledge it as wrong, you know the reasons yourself and can specify them for the public.

Especially with twitter who ban posts on covid they label as having a potentisl risk of spresding misinformation. By doing this they pretty much acknowledge people are incredibly credulous and naive. Otherwise why else would they ban it? Surely the individual could judge for themselves whether it is misinformation or not.

Besides. How do we reslly believe a corporation like twitter has our best interests?(As a citizen of America) They are openly are leftist and actively censor snd silence opposing views. Trunp is banned while we have terrorists like the Taliban alloud on there.

In my opinion they just censor opposing views because they know there is the fear of convincing them they(the poster) are right. In which they don't want that for propably some self centered reason or they want to maintain along with all other sources a monopoly on news with leftist indoctrination(Trans, LGTBTQ+, Feminist movement?, and whatever else.

The Texas 'heartbeat ban' isn't medically accurate because there's no heart that early in pregnancy, providers say

Many women don't know they're pregnant at 6 weeks, when a pregnancy is still an embryo.¬†HUIZENG HU/ Getty Images

""Heartbeat bills"" are misnomers because there's no heart nor beating at 6 weeks of pregnancy.¬†

Doctors can only detect fluttering cells that will become the heart, and call it ""cardiac motion.""¬†

A 6-week pregnancy is an embryo, not a fetus, and fetal heart development is a continuum.¬†

The new¬†Texas law banning abortions after 6 weeks of pregnancy,¬†like others like it, is often referred to as a ""heartbeat bill,"" indicating a cutoff point when doctors can detect a fetal heartbeat.¬†

As Texas Governor Greg Abbot¬†said in a Facebook video¬†right before signing the bill, it ""ensures that the life of every unborn child who has a heartbeat will be saved from the ravages of abortion."" The law is expected to be challenged and, if it prevails, will go into effect September 1, 2021.¬†

But¬†Dr. Bhavik Kumar, a family medicine physician and abortion provider at the Planned Parenthood Center for Choice in Houston, told Insider ""pregnancies this early do not have a beating heart"" ‚Äî and that's a medical fact.¬†

For one, a pregnancy that's six weeks along is still an embryo. It's not a fetus until the 9th week after conception or 11th week after the last menstrual period, according to¬†Healthline.¬†

Plus, most women don't even know they're pregnant at six weeks, let alone get a doctor's appointment to confirm it.¬†

""At six weeks, most women would not have any clue they were even pregnant if they weren't carefully tracking menstrual cycles, and that doesn't even take into account the millions of women with irregular cycles who might go six weeks or longer between periods as a normal part of their life,"" Dr. Stephanie Ros, an OB-GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of South Florida, told Insider.¬†

She said at that point, the embryo is a quarter-inch long. ""It's barely noticeable on ultrasound, we often have to use transvaginal ultrasound to be able to see it at all,"" she said.¬†

What's really happening is 'cardiac motion' from cells that will become the heart

The so-called ""heartbeat"" that's detected at six weeks isn't a heart nor is it beating. ""There's electrical activity within cells that will become a heart, and we see that on an ultrasound machine as a flickering that can be audible through the machine,"" Kumar said. ""We refer to that as cardiac motion.""¬†

""Certainly different people have different feelings around seeing that and what that means,"" Kumar added, ""and that is up to each person to decide how they value that.""¬†

Indeed, the president of the¬†American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which represents more than 60,000 OB-GYNs in the US,¬†made a similar point in 2019¬†in opposition to ""heartbeat bills.""

""Pregnancy and fetal development are a continuum,"" he said. ""What is interpreted as a heartbeat in these bills is actually electrically induced flickering of a portion of the fetal tissue that will become the heart as the embryo develops."" That tissue continues to develop throughout the first trimester.¬†

Only in the past few decades has the technology been advanced enough to detect cardiac motion that early, Dr. Saima Aftab, medical director of the Fetal Care Center at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami,¬†told LiveScience in 2019. The fluttering, she said, also doesn't indicate the viability of the future heart or the pregnancy.¬†"
2,"I get it. I‚Äôm team thanos, I want less people on earth. If we pronounce people dead when their heart stops, then it's not out of this world to start life when the heartbeat starts. And if they did the bill for 9 weeks for the heart to develop, we would still have the same outrage."
1,"Cue the ""we need to deny welfare to unwed mothers who blatantly 'decide' to have a baby"" crowd."
1,"I really want to have a discussion, about this, No politics, no name calling, just a simple discussion, I understand what this article is saying, but I want to know why it does not bring up adoption, just give the child up to an adoption agency or surrender it to the hospital upon delivery this way the hospital can give it to an agency that can give it to a family that really might want it?"
0,"Funny because I, a blue state resident, is keeping red states like Texas afloat by the taxes I pay."
0,"How does that alleviate the burden of carrying a rapist's child?  How does that (to put it bluntly) undestroy their body?  How does that prevent the hospital bill, or the trauma of childbirth?  How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria?  How does that make it less of an economic burden to take an unwanted child and foist them into a poorly organized and definitely underfunded foster system (it's Texas, in case you think they care) that _mostly_ results in molestation, prostitution and abuse?  How does that not further the burden of guilt placed on someone who never wanted that child to begin with?

Utterly and completely destroying a good section of the work force, emotionally, physically, financially and in all ways permanently, (unless they have a neuralizer, panacea or a winning lottery ticket respectively) is not good for the economy.

And that's just considering the unlucky and unwilling mother.  What of her coworkers, or her significant other?  They have to pick up the hours or those companies simply do without, resulting in lost revenue, quality, and supply.  Have you ever worked a 12 hour double shift, or an 8 hour triple shift?  Because I fucking have, and I wasn't even involved.  Now you have to deal with burn out and turn over from an entirely unrelated set of people, time into training and damaged product or shoddy services resulting in slow-down FOR 9 MONTHS.  And that's if they can come back at all!  The U.S. at large basically doesn't even have a support system for pregnant people if you compare it to other first world nations.

There is no ""what if we try x."". This is a bad law designed to make broken homes that a political base can scapegoat and slavewage 16 years down the line.  It is designed to be economically expensive because that's _the whole point._"
2,"Do you know how much an abortion at planned parent hood or some other abortion clinic is? Honest question I do not know. I found planned parent hood says it could be $0-$1,500. but I am not sure what other places charge, I know in a hospital it can be 5,000 or a bit more for vaginal birth or higher for C-section. How can any women really afford a abortion then or delivery period then? 

You talk about How does that (to put it bluntly) undestroy their body? or the trauma of childbirth? How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria.  Have you seen the side effects of both a hormonal pill abortion or a medical abortion? For hormonal pill, it is not unusual for a women having to go to the hospital because the bleeding does not stop, but continues to get worse. Some women become sick and mentally damaged seeing that amount of blood and the cells of the baby after cleaning up that mess, During the surgical abortion where they stick a vacuum up there, it is not unusual for the doctor to cause damage to the uterus and other organs that actuary harm the chance of having another baby in the future, along with bleeding, and causing tears that might need to be surgically fixed. So you will have to go to the hospital for surgery. which case is all traumatic in my opinion. and more of an economic burden now they have more bills to pay. (not saying vaginal birth or C-section is better they all have their risk too)

to your other argument, why cant an employer higher a temp from an agency? There are temp agency that people do sign up with to find part time work, they usually work part time or full time during a short period of work, do you think those short term workers would like to have that job for a bit?"

1,Fake news! Wake up people. No one talks about a military government in Brazil. All you hear is people pleading military intervention to put a corrupt system out. Witch is not possible anymore thus the economy of the country would terribly affected. The military in Brazil already said this is not a possibility anymore.

In the Bible, when God removed Nebuchadrezzar, God made him so crazy that he left the palace and went to live **among the cattle**."
2,"Brazilians are clowns...I know it  ran away from the country as soon as I could. The truth however is more complex and it is not fully portrayed around the world. There are things, a few of them where Bolsonaro is right and on point, others show how ill-suited he is. With that being said, the options were even worse in the last elections.
The Supreme Court in brazil is the biggest joke there ever was, it needs to be completely reformed (The US supreme court should also be reformed, by the way)
The brazilians have a supreme court where ANY lawyer, appointed by a POLITICIAN can become a member, no need to be a judge, no need to be someone suited for the job, and that is a lifetime position! ANY supreme court that is unbiased and trustworthy need to be populated by FEDERAL JUDGES, appointe by election amongst all federal judges in the country, and I said JUDGES, not mere, ill-prepared lawyers. The political appointment process needs to be eliminated, and until it is so, no one will trust the courts. (that holds true in Brazil, US or any democracy).
Also, the voting issue, Bolsonaro is for electronic PLUS paper ballot, so it could be audited, similarly to the US...imagine an election where the electronic votes could not be audited? Yes, that is Brazil. But guess, the brazilian (comunists-inclined) opposition is against that. There is no transparency throughout society, and a society that has its powers opaque to its population, is a democracy of the rich and powerful, (like Russia, Belarus, China....and the list goes on) and all of these countries, including Brazil and US are heading that way unless structural changes are made....and those are usually painful. Inhave little hope though."
0,"You are saying shit. Bolsonaro supporters want a coup to keep Bolsonaro in the power as a dictator, it is what they truly dream of. 

Bolsonaro fighting corruption? Haha You must idolatrate  him to say this nonsense. 
Even the Lava-jato operation that has put Lula in jail he fought against. Now, we  know that his whole family is involved  crimes of stealing money of their employees in the government. He also protected the guy that as asking bribes when buying vaccine."
0,"I agree, there are a lot of reasons why Bolsonaro got there in the first place. I even voted for Bolsonaro in 2018, but because I was disillusioned with the polarized reality of that time and thought he represented a drastic change and action, but as it turns out he was another right-wing populist nutjob, and I slowly began realizing it just like many americans did with Trump. You rightfully point out the Supreme Court is politically appointed, but guess who appointed a judge who freed Lula from jail? You rightfully point out corruption is rampant, but guess who is the one who destroyed the Car-Wash Operation? Yes, Bolsonaro, because turns out, he is a corrupt crook along with his entire family. In the beginning, I used to believe that ""Bolsonaro is a fascist who wants to be dictator"" was just leftist conspiracy, but the more he began actually voicing against democratic institutions, the more I realized all these speeches about ""cleaning the swamp"", or about ""saving the nation"", or about ""the corrupts within congress"" have always been far-right dogwhistles and I had fallen this conspiracy rabbithole, which I have slowly been escaping ever since the pandemic began.

So no, there's no such a thing as ""communist-inclined"" opposition against Bolsonaro, because a lot of prominent right-wing political movements such as the MBL broke off with Bolsonaro, so his opposition is pretty broad even though there are indeed left-wing people in the opposition, just like every opposition against a far-right government. No, there is no such a thing as ""Bolsonaro is for electronic plus paper ballot"", because even if he was for that, the true intention of his when voicing for this agenda is to make people distrust the system and de-stabilize democracy so he can come out as ""the man who will solve it all"", and this entire agenda of electronic plus paper ballot is another dogwhistle for ""the democratic system is bad and I want to be dictator"". Yes, there is no transparency throught society and yes Brazil is a banana republic, but the ""twist"" is that Bolsonaro himself is part of the infamous ""Centr√£o"" of brazilian politics, you know, the ""banana politicians"" themselves, of the rich and powerful?

To summarize: the only thing Bolsonaro ever did for Brazil is to pave the path for the gangsters of Lula to come back and continue their legacy of corruption in the name of the poor, he destroyed the legacy of the sane right-wing who only wanted to fight the corruption of Lula and the PT, and most importantly: the deaths of thousands who fell into his far-right rethoric that the ""virus doesn't exist"", or ""if it exists, China made it up"", just like what happened to many americans with Trump. So fuck Bolsonaro, fuck his far-right nutjobs and fuck his terroristic ""milicias""."

It's natural to be disappointed when we can't get everything we want, but let's keep things in perspective. With a 50-50 tie in the Senate and a mere 8 vote majority in the House, the Democrats are walking an ultrathin tight rope. Even then, they've been getting things down at a historically breakneck space.

This is not a time to be bickering among ourselves, the left of center should be united in promoting the Democratic agenda. Case in point: there are 49 Republican senators whose states are more liberal than Joe Manchin's."

I think the most recent was during Bill Clinton and the house gained during a midterm."

You often see the party controlling the White House lose seats during a midterm such as 2018 when the dems took the house."

2,"Hard disagree. Republicans are dying in droves from covid. Abortion is a hot button issue for a lot of people but most take that to mean it'll make Republicans come out to vote, but it also does the opposite too. Being a hot button topic, it makes pro choice people mobilized to vote as well. I won't lie and say it'll be a super easy sweep, but I'm nowhere near dooming about it as hard as I was before."

0,"I disagree to a point.  M4a and UBI were serious topics of conversation,  including other ""socialist"" programs + climate.  I lived through the Reagan eras, the country has moved forward,  including LGBTQ  rights. Is it as fast as I'd like? Absolutely not - and why I'm involved in helping local candidates run for office.  Politics is slow AF, and the dems have a very large and diverse tent for ideas. Theres the old adage,  ""dems fall in love, Republicans fall in line"" which holds true and why we don't see th Qcult kicked to the curb (or tea party).

Yeah, it took trump to turn out the dem vote. Issue is, the ones who can and need to move the country forward at a quick step,  are millennials,  who just aren't old enough to be reliable voting bloc. 

The major focus really needs to be on un-fuhking the gerrymandered states and allow for more easy access.  This would truly ensure progress and provide a cushion /relax fear of pushing legislation forward that needs to be done,  and not worry about midterm backlash as the Republicans would be nearly dead in the water."
2,"Even if you don't get super bold actions you get something, while the other guys basically do nothing or make your life worse. But whatever, you go cry about your simple way of seeing it while your country burns. This shit is serious right now I don't even get why you can't see that."

All it does is disillusion voters, which is only counterproductive."
2,Yang was the only person for UBI and Bernie was the only one for M4A and even he has walked back on it. What serious convos did you see that I missed?
1,If it‚Äôs so serious then the Dems should be able to easily give us some of what we‚Äôre asking for. You‚Äôre asking voters to put forward effort but not doing the same to the politicians you want us to vote for. Do you honestly think that‚Äôs persuasive?

2,"Insisting on bipartisanship and going after the moderate republican vote instead of putting forward legislation that may be controversial, but is vehemently supported, ie, Medicare for All, aspects of the Green New Deal, cannabis reform, raising the min wage.

It‚Äôs easier and safer for them to do nothing."

UBI was on the main stage for the first time, discussed and made its way into the public arena, including cities instituting it.

0,It's a little bit more complicated than you're presenting it. We're on the razor edge of holding power and barely holding together a coalition with moderate democrats. As a progressive myself sometimes it feels like this non yielding outlook is naive. In order to get what you're demanding requires us to make gains in the house and Senate. Throwing away your vote in protest almost guarantees you'll never get what you want.
2,I'm not trying to persuade you. You are as dense as the fascists.  I'm probably going to just leave.
0,"If you want all that, stop talking shit on Democrats and make sure they get elected.  I've lived in Virginia for 20 years, and for the first time last year Democrats achieved a statewide trifecta:  the governor's mansion and both houses of the legislature.  Since that time, Virginia has legalized cannabis, raised the minimum wage, secured voting rights, expanded public healthcare, passed environmental protections, and a host of other things you no doubt value.

You know how they did it?  By having a solid majority where Democrat legislators from more conservative areas could defect on certain issues.  Republicans did NOTHING to help any of this happen, but Democrats still had the numbers because their majority is solid.

""Both sides are the same"" is the stupidest, most counterproductive thing people are saying right now, and it needs to stop.  It's not based on fact.  It's something half-informed people say to make themselves sound skeptical and savvy, but in the end it only destroys any chance of making progress."
0,"I think you responded to the wrong person.  I'm not a progressive.  I'm a left-leaning moderate.  I used to be an occasional swing voter too.

And I don't actually believe you're any sort of Democrat at all.  Just a Republican in disguise trying to sow division in the party.  Make claims to the contrary all you want; it's your actions that show it."
2,Weren‚Äôt they discussing ways of NOT doing it? And only one of those is a Democrat anyway. Yang and Sanders are independents aren‚Äôt they?
2,"Vote for the people who start the fire or the people who don‚Äôt put out the fire, either way you burn."
2,">ways of not doing it

They were talking about side options for companies and squabbling over nuance but it was a solid push for m4a with a few different flavors. 

>independents

I don't think so, they are democrats but at the edges of the current tent and appeal to progressives and *some* independents (and fringe ""libertarians."" Whom are often ignorant of what libertarianism is and want to be contrarian, or - and I contend, a large portion are made up of bots bad faith internet actors. Look at the Bernie subs and bizarre overlap with thedonald + redpill+ language).

Edit: this isn't to say Bernie voters are not real, I know plenty who were,  they just didn't act like or talk like what you see in those subs or online.  Most of the Bernie bros hate major portions of the internet (millennials) for security concerns.  At least, the ones I know irl."
2,I wonder how this all works out with her security detail. They probably have to sweep the place every morning.
0,"The Republican'ts are so desperate to turn this into a ""beige suit"" moment that they don't realize it's 2021 and it's going to backfire on them gloriously. Progress is coming, and progressives will need to VOTE! Slogans are useless. JUST VOTE!"

0,Texas is turning into Gilead
0,"Texas won't secede because... Honestly I'm too exhausted to explain why the state can't at this point. It just can't. As for most rational Texans, we're American, or at least we try and uphold the things that originally made this country and state great, however those assholes ""in charge"" are very un-American, they spit in the face of those that know what it means to be Texan. Thankfully we have some elections coming up soon. 

As for stepping foot in the state, don't. You're not missing out on anything (honestly what the hell would someone even come here for?). Save your money and buy yourself something nice with it. Deny this state your sales tax. You want to hurt a man, hurt him in the wallet."
2,"I'm going to have an unpopular opinion here, but it is not all of Texas. It is the oppressive political system they are in and if they secede, the women affected by the barbaric laws they are making will have even fewer rights. 

I understand the frustration with a portion of that state, but the what the Democrats in that state have been doing shows the desperation of a large section of the population. The productive action would be to call for justice and national influence to be put on those passing these laws. Please do not forget that the state is not a monolith and you condemn all of them with statements like this.

Edit: I guess I didn't know how to spell secede."

2,How about Texas democrats start selling it better and fucking up the GOP instead.....when dipshits in Texas like Beto O'Rourke go on record saying he will vote to ban the guns most Texans have as a prime example...Texas Democrats look like they're just as fucki g stupid as the rest of the damn state.  Until Texas Dems get smart & sell it better to their rural constituents you're gonna get fucked up the ass every time.

0,"It's ironic how republikkkans will give billions of dollars to rich, big businesses ""to help the economy"", but giving the average person money to buy goods that would actually stimulate the economy is a non-starter.

Keep people down is the only way they stay in power.

Instead of paying people's electric bills. Why not pay to have solar panels put on their house. But that takes money out of the pockets of the people giving ""OUR"" representatives money.

Hmmm....."
0,I am starting to think that they want the working classes to stay poor and desperate  so that they'll be easier to exploit.... am I wrong for this?

2,"Yes, but the FACE Act, in its wording, protects both women and facilities."
0,"The thing is, if ""pro-life"" conservatives truly wanted fewer abortions, they would 100% support better sex education in schools and easier (or free) access to contraceptives, because those are the only two reliable methods of reducing the number of abortions. 

They go on and on about ""saving the life of the child"", but what about the quality of life for that child? Are Texas voters going to improve their foster care system? Will they support giving financial aid to mothers who can't afford the children that they never wanted? I don't hear any mention from them about what they are willing to do to support these unwanted children. 

Why are they silent about helping these unwanted children? Because they don't really care about the children. They only care about punishing women for being sexually active. They want women to suffer because those women aren't conforming to their conservative ideals."
0,"Pro-Life Religious Conservatives also love advocating for people who are on life support but will otherwise not get better. People who cannot advocate for themselves e.g. the braindead or the unborn are a great campaigning point for the conservative right because it requires no resources and allows them to both scare people and make people angry at the perceived moral backwardness of progressives. See this podcast about Terry Schiavo for a great example

"
0,Yeah no wonder rightoids chose the heart over the brain when deciding what‚Äôs alive
2,So what restrictions are we placing on men then?
0,"In all fairness, while a fetus doesn‚Äôt yet a conscious, they are still likely to be born (unless there‚Äôs a as opposed to a brain dead person

Regardless, before the fetus is viable, it has no brain function and is on the same level as a brain dead person. The heartbeat argument isn‚Äôt a good one."
0,"Republicans once tried to steal a brain-dead woman from her family to keep her alive as a way of responding to exactly this argument.    
"
2,Is it illegal in Texas to put the fetus on life support and then pull the plug?
0,"Well, I think some Republicans are smart enough to realize that if they outlaw pulling life support on people who are brain dead, hospitals would be overwhelmed with care for individuals who had no chance of walking out the door again.

But Republicans have no problem telling women they need to be life support for a fetus, whether the woman chooses to or not."
0,The same people yammering on about abortion being murder believe that pulling the plug on a brain dead person is also murder. Remember Terry Schivo?
2,These monsters oppose that too. No matter how much their grandma is suffering they will refuse to end her misery.
0,"There is no logic when dealing with people willing to do mental gymnastics to fit their square beliefs into the round holes of reality. Let‚Äôs not get into the argument of let‚Äôs force motherhood on girls but not force fatherhood on boys. Or here‚Äôs a good one that‚Äôll put them in a logic loop, if an illegal immigrant is pregnant does that mean her child is a us citizen?"
2,"This is a messy analogy. Obviously a fetus at six weeks is ‚Äúalive‚Äù both sides know this. A brain dead person is at the end of their conscious and a fetus is at the beginning. That‚Äôs the real difference.

I don‚Äôt think republicans chose the heartbeat detection because that means human life. They think it‚Äôs human life from the start. They just know they have to keep it legal in SOME capacity, no matter how minor. The heart best is a symbolic choice for them. And it just so happens to be before most women even know that they are pregnant."
2,"Thinking back to Terri Shiavo, I'm pretty sure conservatives were arguing not to unplug her."
0,i‚Äôm all for abortion but how is someone about to die and someone ab to be born comparable
1,Interesting argument but the difference is that braindead people will never be cognitive again whereas fetuses are still growing into cognitive people
2,Let‚Äôs go with just not killing people at all. That would be nice.
0,"Throw in emergency contraception as well(Plan B, or the ‚Äúmorning after‚Äù pill). Because people make mistakes."
0,"I was born to an ill-treated mother who hated girls, couldn't succeed in her efforts to in induce a miscarriage, and couldn't cope with having a 5th child at 25.  In my 60s I still suffer from the mental and physical injuries. I wouldn't wish my childhood onto anyone. 

Women must be free to choose, not just for their own sakes, but for the sake of their children."
0,"This is of course correct. They don‚Äôt want abortions to go down, they want women to stop having sex (except with them of course). It isn‚Äôt about abortion, it‚Äôs about sex and who they think should and shouldn‚Äôt be having it."
0,"Its 100% about judgment and control. If you allow free access to contraceptives and sex ed, you are condoning sinners. To them, its a sin trade- sex or abortion."
0,I‚Äôve long held that any pro lifer that has their own kids instead of adopting is a hypocrite.
2,They should be pulling the plug on a lot of the COVID patients in ICUs. What a delusional waste.
1,I mean an abortion is just pulling the plug as well. The plug in this case is a womb.
0,"Everything that the religious right supports makes sense in the context of punishing women for sex and does not make sense in the context of preventing abortions: abstinence only education, prohibitions on birth control and lack of government support for families. At some point in time we have to stop giving abusers the benefit of their word."
1,Yes but the definition of ‚Äúlife‚Äù and ‚Äúalive‚Äù can be debated based on what you believe. According to science everything is alive in some way as long as the cells are alive
0,That was one very public case. Brain dead people get taken off life support every day and not a peep from the right. They also have no issue with taking a human life if they feel the human doesn‚Äôt deserve to live(executions).
0,"There is no difference. 

Either you support life, or you don‚Äôt. 

The republicans do not. 

You cannot claim to be pro life and be in favor of the death penalty.

You cannot claim to be pro life and be in favor of someone who refuses to wear a mask, knowing doing so may kill a child."
0,That‚Äôs horrific and sad. So many tragic stories that get conveniently ignored by people who call themselves religious. I am so GD tired of these people ruining the entire world for everyone else. So tired and so angry that I hope they do not get vaccines and get to meet their sky daddy sooner than later. The preverbal silver lining.
0,"Woah, that seems to be quite a severe reaction to a joke about the unconstitutional stupidity going on in Texas. Guess you aren‚Äôt competent enough to have a baby or raising children either. Womp womp."
2,The type of people who shouldn‚Äôt be raising children include people who hide behind a screen and throw needless insults at strangers. I‚Äôm sure whatever little spawn comes from you will also be an asshole.
2,I agree that some of these people just don‚Äôt want what they perceive as an easy out for irresponsable sexual behaviors. Yes But a lot of these people very genuinely believe it‚Äôs wrong to end a human life in the womb. And not everyone who believes that is religious or even conservative.
0,"Irrelevant, neither have the right to use someone else's body or resources to continue existing. 

If a person needed one of your lungs to live, should you be forced to give it to them?"
0,BUT THE NEWS SAID ‚ÄúIT WAS THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT!‚Äù AND MY FRIENDS SAID ‚ÄúTHEY WANT TO PUNISH WOMEN.‚Äù WHY ARENT YOU AGREEING WITH ME!?
0,"Why should it matter? It is an embryo not a baby. It is a woman's choice, nit the court's or government's while still not viable outside her body. Forcing a woman to carry is inhumane. Back to illegal, unsafe abortions?"
0,"""Noone has the right to use someone else's body or resources to continue existing""
The point is true in all aspects but it still extends way after a person is born, Infact, baby, children and even many teenagers may not be equipped to survive. In so the argument you provide also excuses a parent putting their infant baby on the street and leave."
2,"No. I mean, I think that‚Äôs a weak analogy. But yes, I agree abortion should be legal.

Abortion is killing a human. But sometimes it‚Äôs legal to kill humans. War. Abortion, endings brain dead people."
2,The media is full of shit on both sides. I believe abortion should be legal. I also think it is infanticide. And Im a Democrat. All these things can be true at once.
2,That is actually perfectly legal in many states - ERs and FDs are designated safe surrender sites for women who cannot cope with motherhood

The point of the organization is to incite street fights and parade around in uniform. Often with police, invited or not. In this, they are little different than the English blackshirts.

That they make noises about Western Culture doesn't impress me any more than do the noises jihadists make about religion."
2,"I was asked a question (that has been deleted) about ""what civ"" I'm ""proud"" of. Interesting question!

I was raised steeped in Western culture. Grandparents in the German film industry, photographer dad, actress mom. They taught me (some) German and French. Went to international school. Studied physics and medieval studies in a college with a Great Books program. 

I can't think of a better way to spend an afternoon than at the Met or MOMA. 

Am I ""proud"" of Beethoven and Mozart? I had nothing to do with them. I enjoy them, I love them, I am deeply moved by them. But pride implies personal achievement. Just look it up: 

1. feeling deep pleasure or satisfaction as a result of one's own achievements, qualities, or possessions or those of someone with whom one is closely associated.
""a proud grandma of three boys""
2. having or showing a high or excessively high opinion of oneself or one's importance.
""a proud, arrogant man""

I am quite proud of a short play I wrote that got a good review in the NY Times. It brought me to LA where I met my wife who was a TV writer. (Our little joke is that we met through the NY Times.)

I am proud of my father's work, with which I had little to do, but I helped him in the darkroom and changed his film sometimes. 

I work in the space program and I'm proud of that, though I'm in a support position and have nothing to do with designing or selecting missions.

But to be ""proud"" of Monet or Voltaire just seems bizarre to me. I love them and would defend them, and I'm deeply moved by them, and would be devastated if the works were destroyed. But pride doesn't enter into it."
0,But Manchin and Sinema believe the filibuster (a senate rule) is somehow more democratic than the enumerated rights such as the 14th and 15th amendments of the constitution.
2,They should eliminate the filibuster to protect VOTING rights.
0,"Lemme fix this

Amy Klobuchar: Senate should eliminate the filibuster to protect ~~abortion~~ rights"
0,"I love the fact that every time I get an email about an important issue saying: ""contact your representatives now!"" I get to just say naw, I'm good. They got this.

Smith, Klobuchar, Omar. Three fucking amazing women. Glad they represent me."
0,"Protect voting rights first.  Then follow up and protect health care and then abortion rights. 

Just my opinion"
2,"So what happens if we lose seats in the midterms. Filibusters are there to protect the minority party. What we do now can be used against us, just like the so called nuclear option was."
2,"The problem is that Senators no longer stand and filibuster.  They send an email and go home. 

We need to return to the stand and talk filibuster.  When you sit, you quit. Then we vote."
0,And voting rights. And the climate.
0,Even worse there are at least two ‚Äúdemocrats‚Äù (Manchin being one) who aren‚Äôt pro choice ‚Ä¶
2,"It‚Äôs not just Manchin and Sinema. 

Joe Biden also wants to keep the filibuster."
2,Agreed! A senate rule shouldn‚Äôt outweigh rights given under the constitution.
0,"That‚Äôs what concerns me too. If we eliminate the filibuster and the GOP grabs the majority? Texas‚Äôs law will look like child‚Äôs play compared to what could be done at the Federal Level.

Personally? I think that we should go back to the old filibuster rules(talking nonstop until the speaker wears out)."
0,"The last time republicans took over the senate, McConnell eliminated the filibuster. That‚Äôs how they confirmed all those federal judges and SCOTUS conservative judges. So yeah, Manchin and Sinema are pretty naive to believe if republicans win the senate, the filibuster will still be around."
1,"Lol, yeah. The GOP has really shown a pattern of following the rules in the past. 

This shit right here is why the Dems, who represent like 60% of the country's population, can't get anything done. When the GOP get power, they fucking use it. When the Dems gets power, they waste 18 months trying to be polite and bipartisan, then get fucking crushed in the midterms.

Voting rights, reproductive rights, climate efforts, income inequality reduction, and every other democratic effort is going to fail in the name of tradition and decorum."
0,It‚Äôs fun how you think McConnell isn‚Äôt going to eliminate the filibuster at the first available opportunity the moment they take control in 2022.
0,"And please understand abortion is nowhere to be found in the Bible nor the constitution. BTW, anyone who believes in pro-life should back vaccines and mask mandates aimed at saving lives."
2,"Biden‚Äôs era of good governance is way behind us. His years in the senate are very different from what we‚Äôre seeing today. During Trump tenure, we‚Äôve seen a complete erosion of moderates and bipartisanship in congress. The guy is like a high school kid asking for his BFF to fight on his side. Biden can‚Äôt get his agenda passed, unless either Manchin and Sinema stop annoying us with their ‚Äúfilibuster is democracy‚Äù non sense, or republicans won‚Äôt use it to sabotage the democratic agenda."
0,"That‚Äôs what concerns you? 

What concerns me is McConnell absolutely eliminating the filibuster just to punish Dems for talking about doing so, and everyone being all ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt do that‚Äù as he proceeds to do it, followed by ‚Äúwell nothing we can do I guess.‚Äù"
0,"If you don't get rid of the filibuster then the GOP wins the midterm elections.

Then they get rid of the filibuster.

Then they take away your right to vote"
2,"That was the so called nuclear option, and was voted in by democrats during the previous administration. Lets not make the same mistake again."
0,"Go for it then, and end the filibuster, and then come on here crying because the GOP got a majority and used your rule against you. They didn't write the nuclear option, we did, now you crying cause they used it. They didn't break any rule, they used the rule we wrote."
1,"It's fun how he used a Democrat rule to do it last time, and people like you can't understand how every new rule you put in place can and will be used against you. It feels good for the moment though, right. How's watching everything you accomplish with that rule get torn down in 2022 gonna feel."
2,"It. Is. Not. Just. Manchin. And. Sinema. 

I‚Äôd be willing to wager there are around 8-10 Democrats who would vote to protect the filibuster if it came down to it on the floor."
2,"My biggest fear about Biden, once I realized he was the only one who could win against trump, was that he knew how serious this moment was, but wouldn‚Äôt step up to it. 

My fears are being proven true every single day."
2,"They could‚Äôve gotten rid of the filibuster when they had slight control‚Ä¶but didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶.why?

Because they knew that getting rid of it would mean that every time the power structure changed, previous legislation could be undone with a simple majority."
2,"Sure, but you don‚Äôt use the nuclear option when convenient, for the simple fact, it overrules the filibuster."
1,"
Why were the democrats forced to go nuclear? You know why. Cut the ‚Äúit‚Äôs the democrats fault for going nuclear‚Äù crap. 

Would you rather they just shrug their shoulders and do nothing? 

‚ÄòCome on."
2,Well... they actually are the ones who ended filibusters for supreme court justices.
2,"I won't be complaining, but to be fair I've completely given up on this shit hole country. We've got like 2 actually liberal senators, 52 conservatives, and 46 who are very concerned on Twitter. I'm just hopeful I can emigrate before it gets much worse."
2,"Imagine thinking the filibuster is gonna save us after Republicans take control in 2022. 

Wow. 

You clearly haven‚Äôt been paying an ounce of attention, have you?"
0,"Quote it. And please, I don‚Äôt want to hear ‚Äúthou shall not kill‚Äù that‚Äôs not abortion."
0,"Again, Biden grew up in a very different era of good government and don‚Äôt expect him to change. McCain was from his era and so ‚Äúwere‚Äù Lindsay, Collins and Murkowski. But since Trump came in, it hasn‚Äôt been the same on the republican side of the aisle. Not that Biden isn‚Äôt doing anything wrong at all. In fact, he‚Äôs on the right side of history. We‚Äôre simply faced with a different era of bad government led by conspiracy theorists in congress and state governments with ZERO knowledge of American government and history per se."
2,"You have no idea why they did what they did.  

I was a lifelong Republican, until 2017.  The GOP of today does not resemble the GOP of 2015."
0,"So you mad about the Republicans using a procedural rule that Democrats came up with to do something you didn't like. And using that as justification to make an even more easily abused rule because it benefits you at the moment, with no concern for the Republican abuses that are almost guaranteed.  Talk about short sighted."
0,"Huh, I‚Äôm saying that the only thing the Bible says about abortion is a recipe for, quite literally, performing an abortion, commanded by God, in the tabernacle nonetheless. I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúthou shalt not kill‚Äù has to do with it. 

"
0,"We‚Äôre going to have to agree to disagree. 

Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm 38, and my entire adult voting life has been watching bad government and watching the Republicans win, even when Democrats have power. 

Trump isn‚Äôt the beginning of something, he‚Äôs the culmination of decades of bad government on Republican terms. He‚Äôs the inevitable endgame of the Republican Party. 

If we can‚Äôt expect Biden to change, then we deserve to lose in 2022 and he deserves to be impeached by the Republicans in 2023. 

Historians in free countries‚Äî which won‚Äôt be ours‚Äî will look back and consider this all to be a progression, not a sudden shift from good government to bad government with the election of Trump.

The election of Trump was the natural reaction to America daring to elect a black man, and you‚Äôd better believe Republicans will burn the country to the ground before they ever see Kamala Harris in the Oval Office. 

We our on borrowed time, a narrow window, and Biden is counting on institutions to save us when they have already failed."
0,"You‚Äôre looking at the whole thing from your own simplistic point of view. You do know republicans became the party of ‚ÄúNO‚Äù under Obama right? They wouldn‚Äôt allow democrats to pass any bills at all. Please don‚Äôt make this about me. Unless you understand that republicans spend their entire terms in congress sabotaging democrats, this conversation is futile. Many republicans came by and went, but Gingrich, Boehner, McConnell and McCarthy have been the worst in modern history. Democrats legislate, republicans on the other hand, spend their entire time resisting democratic legislations without offering any alternatives. Pro-life and white supremacy aren‚Äôt what make the nation move forward. When was the last time republicans introduced any bills for the general welfare? Tax cuts for the wealthy?"
1,"I‚Äôm 100% sure the person living in the fantasy world is you, who for some reason thinks the filibuster is part of the Constitution and will save Dem progress. 

Bless your angry heart."
1,"Anyways, let‚Äôs come back to this conversation in about two and a half years when McConnell ends the filibuster and you act surprised about it. 

It‚Äôll be right around the time they‚Äôre impeaching Biden, just because they can.

Can‚Äôt wait to say I told you so. 

But, sure. The filibuster, man. Totally the savior of American democracy."
0,"Yeah, Moses‚Äô Book of Numbers. I thought you were against abortion and my only point was that republicans keep throwing their anti-abortion stances out there and it‚Äôs apparently based on Christianity, yet they‚Äôre unable to prove which scriptures in the Bible ban it."
0,"This passage from Numbers is always mentioned and always dismissed. Most pro-life people will interpret this as a recipe for causing sterility, not abortion. Either way, pretty disturbing."
0,"In modern history and right after Gingrich, the only time republicans were this extreme was when Obama came in. No one is saying there was never any disagreements between democrats and republicans, it‚Äôs expected and as a matter of fact, it‚Äôs part of the democratic process in which the system of checks and balances is based on and compromise being the ultimate outcome. And yes, Trump did finalize the radicalism of the Republican Party that went directly after the very institutions of the federal government. That‚Äôs not disagreements, it‚Äôs anarchy, sedition and treason. I‚Äôm fully aware of the racist, anti-semitic, homophobic, Islamophobic and sexist agenda of the Republican Party to attend to its confederate base, but it didn‚Äôt amount to an insurrection on the Capitol until Trump came in."
1,"Yea, like 4 years under Trump being the no party. Grow the fuck up and try and understand that you can't do anything that they can't do. Make a new rule, they will show you how to use it. But by all means do what feels good for the moment. Who cares if they use it to pass a national abortion ban in 3 years."
2,"‚ÄúThe only time Republicans were this extreme is when Obama came in.‚Äù 

Sigh. 

You‚Äôre very close to getting it."
0,"‚ÄúMake a new rule, they will show you how to use it.‚Äù 

Guess the Democrats should just continue to play chess with rules according to how Republicans want them as the pigeons shit all over the chess board, then."
0,"You jumped to Obama without paying attention to my comments on Gingrich first. I can go all the back to the very beginning with the founders. Do you want to start to Thomas Jefferson? Because I‚Äôm pretty sure, the crisis we‚Äôre dealing with as of now is due to DJT and his Russian backed QAnon. BTW, I know what the fake Tea Party did. This thread simply isn‚Äôt dealing with that topic. Trump launched a failed coup d‚Äô√©tat, that‚Äôs an attack on the entire United States government."
2,"Continue to follow the fucking constitution, and rules that have stood for a hundred years. Make some new ones, and you better believe they are going to show you how to use them."
0,"And you‚Äôre, for some reason, just forgetting about that whole era when Republicans embraced McCarthyism, or maybe that‚Äôs just good government.

Or when the Republican Party embraced the southern strategy. 

Or when the Republican Party essentially stole the 2000 election. 


Again, the crisis we‚Äôre dealing with now did not start with Trump. 

The insurrection on the Capitol was the inevitable conclusion. 

McCain gave us Sarah Palin. 

Murkowski and Collins and Romney aren‚Äôt the good guys that are going to help us save democracy. 

There are no moderate Republicans, and haven‚Äôt been any moderate Republicans in a long time. 

We‚Äôve had multiple opportunities to stop this crisis from unfolding, it‚Äôs just the Democratic Party, in spite of all evidence to the contrary, continued to at least pretend to believe the GOP was operating in good faith, until the insurrection happened. 

Anyways, I think we‚Äôre both basically in agreement and on the same side. 

I just think our crisis began well before Trump and the insurrection happened."
0,"It‚Äôs fun how you think the Republicans are gonna give a damn about the Constitution when they take back control in 2022.

Anyway, the filibuster wasn‚Äôt originally part of the constitution."
0,"Democrats need to finally learn from the GOP. Judges, nobody gets approved during an election year unless it's Dem appointed PERIOD, NO EXEPTIONS EVER. With the abortion law in Texas, Dems, listen to me, USE THIS PRECIDENCE TO GO AFTER GUNS. In the Dem states, outlaw all firearms and use the people to enforce it. That's the key, if the State isn't enforcing the law, the law can't be challenged, law stands. Come on Dems, I know it's not in your passive nature, but let's get tough, it's time. ""But we don't want to stoop to their level"", grow up and start winning for once"
0,"This is so true. We consistently underestimate the ruthlessness of the GOP, and refuse to take a stand no matter how badly they abuse us."
2,"Going hard left is really a bad idea, you've got a lot if support right now from moderates like me.l"
2,"> Opinion

Fact, actually."
0,"If GOP cheats and lies, then they aren't ""for America"", right?

They should be dismantled for being anti-American, or unconstitutional, or something. They are making a mockery of our country, and Not supporters at all, right?"
2,"So very true.

When your objective is destruction and division your job is  much easier than actually trying to build something."
0,"Universal Healthcare. Abortion Rights. Voting Rights. Climate Change Policies. Are not going hard left. These are basic facts of most if not all major economies. 

In Canada ‚Äúgoing hard left‚Äù is talking about UBI or drug program (already available for 65+) or free dental care. 

‚ÄúModerates‚Äù in the US need to look at how the rest of major economies work."
2,"Standing still and status quo are not providing any results. 


So what else you got?"
0,"There is no such thing as a moderate democrat at this point. A good example is Joe Biden. Joe is now, because the GOP has shifted so far right, basically a 1980's republican. You are either progressive or in the wrong party."
0,"Well‚Ä¶..that‚Äôs what the GOP does. They minimize their failures and maximizes others.

And don‚Äôt say that ‚Äúboth sides are the same‚Äù. This meme is the first I knew about the four killed in Niger."
0,And the twice impeached failed president [stopped going to Dover airforce base to pay respects to the fallen Soldiers](
2,"My headcanon about this is that Sean Spicer convinced him it didn't happen because if he did deliver remarks about it, there was a 100% chance of him mispronouncing 'Niger' on camera."
2,Thanks now I can pass this info on to my Republican Father.
0,"By putting our ally Chad, on the no fly list, trumpy caused the death of these four soldiers. When trumpy did this, Chad immediately pulled their soldiers out if the area. It was the first day going out looking for insurgents without the aid of soldiers from Chad. Why weren't there tons of investigations into this? Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi, though."
0,"So the trouble with the right wing is that nothing is hypocritical to them because the way they think is that as long as it serves their political goals it's right and proper. 

This is so fundamental that they're not capable of true hypocritical thinking because their so backwards that they can't line the two hypocritical thoughts up. 

George Orwell called it ""Double Think"" and it's legit terrifying."
0,Buttery mails! SMH. I hate the GOP
0,"And let's not forget that he had no business being there--apparently it was some kind of favor to Putin, and he sent mercenary soldiers, not Marines, who then left behind the soldiers, including one who was still alive, but then ambushed and mutilated (that's the one whose mother he said ""he knew what he was getting into"" to).   He caused their deaths.   

The even worse hypocrisy was their absolute radio silence on this--Trump literally CAUSING the needless deaths of four American soldiers--after years and years and years of screaming about Benghazi (which was an attack on the US Embassy in a known hotspot, the same as other attacks during the Bush and Reagan presidencies--AND Hillary had requested add'l security, and the GOP had refused it)."
0,"And four Nigerien troops were killed too. 

Also, a typical Trumpian ""Blame Obama"" attack: 

>On 17 October, during a press conference, Trump was asked about his silence by a reporter and commented on the incident. Trump responded by saying that he wrote letters to the families of the victims, and accused his predecessors, specifically President Obama, of not or rarely calling the families of deceased soldiers."
0,The GOP does this because they get away with it every time.
0,"He also got a SEAL killed in his first military action. Crickets.

Edit: and this was *just* off of the Benghazi series of investigations that republicans found nothing actionable with, even after 11 hours of sworn testimony.  Imagine Trump in the same situation."
0,"Well, see, in Trump-world the only deaths that count are not under Republican watch.  The rest of the deaths are jack shit."
2,Never forget who Trump and Republicans really are
0,Well got damit we got a real president now LA David Johnson
2,And both parties are the same?
2,"It was on their way back to the home base when they stopped for water at the village of Tongo Tongo, about 120 miles north of Niger‚Äôs capital. There, the group was ambushed by Islamic State-linked militants armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and small firearms."
0,Don't  forget these soldiers were just losers and suckers according to trump
0,"Don't sign up for the military if you don't want to die. My GF's entire family is republican and they asked my opinion about all these deaths happening with the withdrawal from Afghanistan. 

Why do they all of a sudden care about these deaths when we spent 20 years either being killed or killing people?

Fucking blows my mind the stupid shit these people say."
2,"How many lives did we save by leaving Afghanistan? 
Those 15 that died were heroes and they saved potentially 10‚Äôs of thousands of lives. 
This is why we should be talking about. This should be the headlines. 

Instead the rhetoric from the extreme left and right are ruining our country. There‚Äôs a better perspective out there we just have to try a little harder to empathize with our fellow men. We have to become obsessed with making that happen instead of giving in time the easiness of fighting eAchother."
2,"You have the white house, the house and most of the senate, why would you spread 4 year old nonesense. You need to be saying what your doung to imorove the current situation on like 10 different fronts. Stay current or get out voted. Take some responsibility for once. No one cares aboutbthe finger pointing"
1,These solders didn't die because of an absolute shit show of decision making by the president. Soldiers die in war. period. However what happend in Kabul was entirely preventable and a direct result of Bidens botched withdrawal oppertation.
0,"Remember when we just blew off the Kurds, our allies, leaving them to fend against both Assad and the Turks?  But we are incensed at Biden leaving the the Afghans in Afghanistan after getting over 100,000 of them out?"
0,Any time they say they ‚Äòsupport the troops‚Äô this as well as their hostility towards the VA and veterans homelessness and mental health should be brought up immediately.
0,"To be fair, allowing Trump to pronounce Niger would be a very dangerous request."
0,"Well, they don't necessarily care about Afghanistan either. It's just a political opportunity to blame President Biden."
2,Funny how obsessed with Trump you guys still are lmao
0,Using the deaths of soldiers for political gain is an incredibly low thing to do. Do not sink to the Republicans level.
1,Are you saying it was ok for joe the unicorn to kill 13 service members?
2,"As a vet, I CAN tell you that vets are props for the powerful."
2,I remember. The widow was the woman in Florida who got a phone call from Trump.
0,This was on the news.  The only places where it was censored was on right-wing fake news propaganda.
2,"I mean ... neither the dems or republicans want attention to *what* those soldiers were doing in Africa, who they were killing, or which oil company was paying for it."
2,"Mhmm. Absolutely zero ability to self reflect at all and think ‚Äòhey maybe the way I‚Äôm going about this is wrong or hypocritical?‚Äô

Like the way they think Muslims and other religions are so *obviously* wrong but can‚Äôt apply those same critical thinking skills to their own religion. Like if a Muslim believed just as fervently as a Christian did, don‚Äôt you believe they think their religion is the one true one just like they do?"
2,This literally sums up the trump presidency
2,">On 17 October, during a press conference, Trump was asked about his silence by a reporter and commented on the incident. Trump responded by saying that he wrote letters to the families of the victims, and accused his predecessors, specifically President Obama, of not or rarely calling the families of deceased soldiers."
0,No. Democrats criticize Biden. They aren't trying to ignore anything just because Trump was worse.
2,Good call. I try to pay attention to whataboutism but sometimes it's easy to miss.
2,How many republicans have attended trump rally‚Äôs after the election he lost.?
0,Trump couldn't remember her husband's name.
1,Not sure how it minimizes Biden‚Äôs failures in any way
2,"He wasn't the center of attention, how is a mentally deranged narcissist supposed to react?"
0,"I always shudder with amazement how any veteran could ever support Trump over Biden in any way. The difference between the two on Veteran's issue is about as far apart as one could get:

It's like dude, you don't get it... these people could not give less of a shit about ""the troops"" or ""the flag"" and they certainly don't care about being caught up in some technical hypocrisy. They like cruelty, they like the war. They love that violence is being done to people who they dislike, that's all. It's a really simple, yet totally terrifying."
0,"I don‚Äôt know what this means. For 4 years we demanded trump stop talking about all the things he said Hillary did wrong - now Biden wins and we‚Äôre talking about all the things trump did wrong. 

I know it doesn‚Äôt go over well in the Reddit hive mind but Biden won. Trumps out. We need to stop talking about him and hold our current politicians accountable for the good and the bad."
0,"Not sure how  trump blaming Hillary, who was never president, has anything to do with democrats calling out republican hypocrisy. Granted I don't follow Biden‚Äôs press conferences very closely but I can't seem to recall him trump or Pence by name very often at all."
0,"The problem with your position is that it ignores that Trump did everything he could to sabotage Biden. And his appointees have been slowed down. You are aware that Ted Cruz has prevented Biden's State Dept appointees from being confirmed, right?"
0,"This post is focused on the hypocrisy of republicans not the fact that both during Trump and Bidens administration US soldiers died.

Calling everything that calls out hypocrisy ""whataboutism"" is dishonest at best and malicious at worst."
0,"It still occasionally blows my mind, everything else about him aside, that the media acted like it was a big deal that at George Bush's funeral, Trump didn't make it about himself. They acted like it was a big deal that *the president* behaves with the decorum I'd expect from a healthy 5 year old."
1,"I‚Äôm talking about this post - per my prior comments. 

Why are we pulling up how trump behaved? He‚Äôs out. Biden‚Äôs in. Saying ‚Äúreminder - this is his trump behaved‚Äù comes across as saying ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs ok Biden screwed this up because what about trump!‚Äù 

I‚Äôm fine being in the minority on this opinion I just wish the left would stop being so hypocritical."
0,"Come on. It is honestly, literally, ‚Äúwhat about what Trump did, it was way worse‚Äù at least be big enough to admit it. I am And I was saying in 2015, ‚Äúwhat the fuck, Trumpty Dumpty is a freakin sociopath, NO! ‚Äú"
2,"I think you're misinterpreting the ""it's fine Biden screwed up"" aspect, I don't get the impression he's being let off the hook. I can't blame anyone for continuing to highlight the previous administration's shortcomings in comparable situations to what the current one is being held brutally accountable for."
2,"You can interpret it that way if you want but I don't understand it that way. The title calls out the Republican hypocrisy for blasting Biden now while being fine with Trump back in 2017.

By that standard calling out the different reactions to similar situations aka hypocrisy is from now on always ""whataboutism"" and we will no longer be able to call out hypocrisy at all.

Also what is blasted here is neither the situation leading up to the events nor the failures that led to them but rather the reaction to them."
2,"dude isn't this post and entire context just Dems doing the same, i.e blasting trump back in 2017 and being fine with Biden now? You can change the text to ""Your reminder that when four American soldiers were killed in niger in 2017 Dems raised hell"" and title to ""Dems hypocrisy"" and post it on one of the conservative subs and it'll fit right in.

I've experienced political shithousry in other countries but it's on another level in the US, ~~politicians~~ actually more the supporters, of both sides do the same thing when their guy is not in power. They also do the same thing when your guy is in power. When trump was in t_d was all about obama and drone strikes and now all the dem subs are *but trump did worse*."
1,"So what exactly would you call a ‚Äúwhataboutism‚Äù then? It is bringing up a perceived misdeed, of the past, from the opposition, to deflect from the criticism of a current situation. Exactly what this is. Just like when the Trump supporters would bring up Clinton or Obama to avoid addressing things Trump did. (Sure he might‚Äôve said ‚Äúgrab ‚Äòem by the pussy‚Äù but that was just locker room talk. Clinton actually sexually harassed his underlings) Doesn‚Äôt that sound familiar?"
0,"Dunno in which reality you live but while there are certainly die hard democrats who see no fault in what Biden does the amount of worship Trump gets from republicans is on a whole different level.

There is literally a hearing about the Afghanistan withdrawal initiated by democrats about the Afghanistan withdrawal.

Trump instigated a mob to storm the capitol and got much less heat from republicans than Biden now gets from democrats.

 just as an example.

So no. It is not even close on both sides and thinking that both sides do the exact same thing is again either misinformed or just plain dishonest."
0,"Right. I am a lifelong Democrat but I am not so eat up with partisan bullshit that I deny the obvious. When we do it we are pointing out hypocrisy, when they do it they are deflecting. Ok, live the delusion."
2,"It is exactly as you describe it. Whataboutism is bringing up something that you think was worse to make another mistake seem less bad.

I only disagree that this is the intention of this post. The intention is as I read it to make people remember how different republicans REACTED to the things Trump did wrong compared to how they react to Bidens mistakes now.

The huge difference to me is that the title attacks republicans for their hypocrisy and does not focus on whether Trump or Bidens mistakes were worse."
2,"I was never questioning the validity of the complaint, one way or the other. I was simply pointing out that it is the same tactic. Don‚Äôt you understand that the right also believe they are pointing out the hypocrisy of the left when they do it?"

0,I'm going to say something controversial:  Fani Willis does not think she can find 12 people that would convict Donald Trump.  She knows that there would be jury nullification.

Trump would have enough supporters that would vote not guilty even if they saw him shoot someone on fifth avenue.

1,So it's alright to murder a baby because some people with body dismorphia have babies? WTF is wrong with these people?
1,"If you have two X chromosomes, you‚Äôre a female. Last I checked, only humans with two X chromosomes could get pregnant. Doesn‚Äôt matter what you identify as or what your birth cert says. Science in this case is fact and if you are pregnant or have gotten pregnant, you are female"
1,"Let me check if a man ever had a baby. 

Nope. Never. 

You know why? Men do not physically have a vagina. 

That‚Äôs a scientific fact. But reality doesn‚Äôt mean anything to the far-left. If they ‚Äúfeel‚Äù it, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúfact.‚Äù  

The clowns have taken over."
2,"Wait so it's no longer a women's issue because women don't exist. Meaning men CAN have a valid opinion on abortions. Suggesting otherwise suggests that trans men aren't real men.

It is transphobic to say men can't have an opinion on abortions."

1,"This is the same kind of person that says men can't make laws about women's bodies. Yet, according to her logic, men can get pregnant? Hmmm."
1,Lol Females are defined as having eggs and getting pregnant under the concept of mammals. You can do some sort of procedure to put eggs in men; but that is obviously not  a man anymore it's a cyborg.

2,What if a female doesn‚Äôt identify with the term woman but can still get pregnant?
2,"I'm pretty sure that in the human species ,the female is the only gender that can get pregnant."
2,"Wait, I don't understand. Someone please clarify.

Is she referring to Female -> Male trans people who still have the female sexual organs necessary to give birth? With the incomplete surgery techniques we have today, it is still possible to get pregnant after the surgery. Wouldn't they would fall into their own category instead of being called a traditional woman?

I don't know if that's what she means. Of course on the surface it looks completely ridiculous, but maybe the above is what she's thinking..?"

1,I think that person is referring to how people with different sexual identities can become pregnant. The lack of understanding of this could actually be construed as the brain disease.
2,"To Mrs. Gandy‚Äôs claim, this is true for male seahorses and perhaps some other species I‚Äôm not aware of, but this is not the case for humans.

  My guess is she‚Äôs using the scientific definition of gender while we‚Äôre using the legal definition which basically a polite way of saying sex."
1,"I'm not sure, because of the username, but I'm getting the sense that this is a troll. but maybe not? I'm not sure. The fact that we can't tell the difference tells you something about the left."
1,"Pretty sure it is a scientific fact--short of being an organism that can reproduce asexually--that only females can get pregnant.  Something about that being the rule for pretty much every species with males and females.  The left is nuts.  Just because you believe something, that doesn't make it fact.  It makes it your opinion.  Opinions are not facts and wishing them so will never make it true.

Being trans is fine if that's how a free individual wants to live.  I literally don't care.  However, it is completely false to claim that men can get pregnant.  It is their opinion that men can get pregnant because it is their opinion that men aren't defined by measurable biological sex characteristics.  Men cannot get pregnant.  Women who want to be men can."
1,"Ok I'll bite. 

Please tell me where the logic falls down.

If a women transitions to being a man, yet still had a uterus, then they can get pregnant and therefore an abortion.

I'm not trying to argue. Genuinely can't see what the point of disagreement is."
1,"I get the sneaking sense that that's actually the point of the post, and it's actually not a leftist post, but rather someone trolling the left. The fact that we can't even tell the difference shows how ridiculous the left has become."

The word mother was not inclusive enough.
It also sickens me how so many people are so for infant murder."
2,Nope. Just the ones who will be getting the abortion. Full stop.
1,Brain damage from those vegan diets and getting vaccinated every two weeks for a virus that cannot be immunized. Pretty sure that's why they also want to be forced into totalitarian rule. Severe brain damage and extreme dependence on the teet of big government.

2,"Well said, with little parenting they are in for a big surprise when they need to bring in income to pay living expenses. No more time to ""protest"" day and night when you have a 9-5 job to attend. my office hires recent college graduates, I have been there over 6 years now, more than ever we are denying candidates after the 1st day working interview. It may be coincidence but so far I see a trend of lazyiness and unwillingness to proactive"
2,She's referring to trans men who haven't got bottom surgery
1,"> The funny thing is that they are right. Transmascs and non-binary people with female genetalia can get pregnant. But watch how quick I get banned, because you don't care about the facts, all you care about is ""FuCk ThE LiBs""

They're not right.  Only women can become pregnant.  Men who pretend they are women are not women and can't become pregnant.  ""Non-binary"" is not a sex.  Humans are male or female.  Females can become pregnant, males cannot."
2,However English speakers born without ovaries can‚Äôt get pregnant. Lol
1,"I don‚Äôt think trans people don‚Äôt exist, I think they living a lie. 

You can‚Äôt simply change your gender and go against science and biology simple because your feeble reptilian brain ‚Äúthinks‚Äù so.

I feel like a potato sometimes, doesn‚Äôt that mean I can identify as one and force my pronouns on others? No, because one you force others to say something, it‚Äôs not about respect and more about manipulation and force.

And back to transgenders, I believe everyone should live their life. If you wanna be XYZ behind closed doors go do so. But don‚Äôt make it my problem, and force yours views on me. I think everyone should love themself for who they are. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on forcing kids to choose a gender. It‚Äôs stupid and pointless. If a child wants to do something, let them do it, unless it could permanently harm them or hurt them, like hormones. And let‚Äôs all agree that a 3 year old might not be able to count their fingers twice and get the same number, let alone choose what they want to be in life. If you were to ask a 3 year old what they wants to be when they grow up, they might say Spider-Man FFS."
2,I'm not surprised they exist. I'm surprised they're allowed out of the asylum.

1,"I always see liberal media say ""What is the Republican Party's obsession with blue hair?"" and play dumb in the article, as if there couldn't be a more obvious indicator of political beliefs by the cookie cutter look that has evolved.

1,I‚Äôm pointing out the obvious hypocrisy of the left saying men can‚Äôt weigh in on abortion debate but also men can get pregnant.
2,Exactly. Before most people would just tell them to shut the fuck up. But now they find each other online and continue the echo chamber
1,XXY is sterile so don‚Äôt have to worry about abortions
1,"the term trans men its purely  a term I use to be polite , they are not men and never will be men  ..science"
1,"A person who identifies as male but was born with female parts can get pregnant, fact."
2,Because its a societal issue... Not a state issue.
1,"Hm? I didn‚Äôt say that at all. I said if a man is pregnant, then that man should have the right to decide what to do with his own body."
1,"Oh I know, I'm agreeing and just saying they don't care about the hypocrisy at all. 
 They only care to hear the opinions of those who fall in line with their insanity, while hypocritically claiming they care about diversity."
1,"They can identify as whatever they want, but this hypothetical person is still a female. An XX biological female human being. Female is a biological term. Whatever is going on inside their head doesn't change their biological sex."
2,"What lie? 

The left IS ridiculous.

The right IS taking horse dewormer."
1,But men can't call it a societal issue because.......? (Insert elitist liberal hypocritical nonsense here)
1,A man can't get pregnant.  I think you mean a woman who identifies as a man.
2,she lives in a fantasy world where her weird world view is universal and uses language like things  have  already been decided in her favor even  though the  vast majority don't agree with her at all
2,There are actually very experimental surgeries on uterus transplants for Trans going M to F but I doubt they mean that since you wouldn't need a abortion if you are actually trying to get pregnant with a huge rare experimental surgery unless something went wrong.
2,"The virus does exist.

Ivermectin is not horse dewormer."
2,The medicine that won't a Nobel Prize in 2015 for its effects on humans? Gtfoh you dipshit. Google shit before you embarrass yourself anymore.
0,Because no one should control another persons body - there was a war about this or something
2,No I mean a man who was assigned female at birth but is a man. But there can of course also be an intersex or nonbinary person who has a uterus.
2,"The first sentence is just blatantly false. Without surgery that is just not the case, except in a super small percentage of genetic mutation cases. Almost universally males have XY and females have XX. This observation is also universal in every mammal on earth"
2,"Sarcasm also exists... Its been the stance of conservatives that covid is a fake for a while... I was being sarcastic.

It is also a cattle-dewormer. And works on PARASITES

Covid... Is a virus."
2,"So much wrong. 

Its an anti-parasite. It won said prize for its work vs parasites. 

Covid is a virus. 

Full stop. 

PS. It 'won' a NPP, not 'won't.' But keep telling others not to embarrass themselves."
1,Then explain how the left is still calling this a wAr oN WoMeN
1,Removed and banned for liberal talking points.
1,"I never met or seen a conservative that believed the virus was fake. Not even Trump. 

Also Ivermectin is IN some horse dewormers, it's primary purpose for being is not as a horse dewormer."
0,"Yes. Trump did call it a hoax. (Which is another way of saying fake) 

Its still only effective against parasites... 

Covid is still a virus."
1,"No... I 'got you' on the definition of a virus v a parasite... The rest was to prove you're full on dumb not just half way. 

Dr's, much like states are unfortunately, woefully, pathetically inequal. Its like comparing the basic humanity of Texas vs Cali, its not a proper comparison. 

Those Dr's should lose their jobs."
2,Yet it IS an parasite med being used for a virus... It deserves the agro.
1,What if you're a pregnant woman? Then it's okay? Just trying to understand the liberal nuance of justifying any and all immoral stances in order to personally benefit
2,I mean if you want to deny him the respect of telling you what he means. The media and leftists were the only ones who thought he meant the virus itself wasn't real.

2,But he is the most popular president ever! ü§´
2,"we need to do this everywhere, all the time.. and not just biden... democrats in general.

We have all had quite enough of clown world.. time to get the adults in the room to manage matters.. this is rediculous."
1,"I'd bet that if we had an election again right now, Trump would win by a landslide. Even the most hardcore liberals are regretting voting Biden in, even people I know in real life. There is absolutely no way Biden can even retain a positive approval rating at this point."
0,The worthless Republican squishes must not be awake yet.  I don‚Äôt see any ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not who we are‚Äù crap.
2,"Took 8 months for everyone to hate him and the people that voted for him to take their signs down in shame. The reality is, it isnt your fault if you were fooled by the media and we have all made decisions. Start looking further into things and start fixing how you make decisions or process information. Billions of dollars goes into creating lies and propaganda because it works. This isnt JFK democrat party anymore or the Bush Republican party. Your representation shouldn‚Äôt be religious level of faith to a political party."
1,It‚Äôs crazy how liberal Reddit is. I think it‚Äôs brainwashing voter bots or something it‚Äôs like the plague. I‚Äôve considered deleting it because most everyone on here is a Biden dick rider. Nice to see some like minded people on here
1,"Wouldn't ""Dump Joe Biden"" be more accurate?  I mean..I doubt even Jill wants to fuck him."
2,cant believe someone would vote for that douche unreal how dumb people are
1,"Joe Biden is the most professional loser I've ever seen. The guy has gotten away with plagiarism throughout his ""career"", election fraud, having a piece of shit son etc. I doubt Democrats will remain in power after 2022-24 if their house of cards start falling next few years."
2,"Someone named Orange_Star commented on me somehow treading on a groups domain. Sorry to say it this way, but I love my republican brothers and sisters, and I could have once called myself one. Now all I do is watch others be radicalized in an echo chamber of absolute nonsense. 

And I‚Äôm even more annoyed to see it working. The radical right and left want chaos and destruction. I want peace and freedom. Also I like to make people think a little deeper about what it is they‚Äôre saying. Usually it‚Äôs a bunch of bs."
2,"History's most boring president. He needs to go to a Nascar event and talk about loving God, the tremendous support he has, crowd sizes, etc."
2,"I disagree slightly, not all Democrats are assholes, many of them are good people. The Democratic Party is not the same as the Radical Left. We need the Democratic and Republican Parties to have this country run as intended. We should instead just be chanting the names of people who have changed this country for the worse and have ended thousands of human lives and hold them accountable. Such as Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Patrisse Cullors, Antifa, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and so on..."
2,Wisconsin state I believe.
1,"The Democrats stole the 2020 election, Biden never won in the first place.  But this might all be a blessing in disguise... the incompetence and radical agenda of the Biden administration is showing the country what the left is really about and hopefully that will result in a landslide victories for republicans in 2022."
1,"Sorry.  We were too busy at work.  Checking in at lunch here.  This is pathetic and idiotic.  Biden is a terrible President and I desperately hope the we can put up a candidate who can defeat him in 24, but this accomplishes nothing more than making Republicans look like a moronic fan club to anyone in the middle."
1,Nah. This is who we are. Fuck Joe Biden.
2,"Attacking governments is kinda what Patriots do, hate to break it to you."
1,"You're not entirely wrong, but it must be remembered that Democrats collectively and repeatedly vote to put the radical left in charge.

If you hand the radicals the keys to the bus, and keep giving them gas money, knowing they are radicals, you don't get to claim it isn't your responsibility when the bus goes off a cliff."
2,It just seems like you have no real Argument or point to make against us although you're still angry and so you're just insulting us based on no logic or proof behind your claim. What's irredeemably sad is the fact that you have no leg to stand on and so you're clinging to insults you would hear a 9 year old saying instead of admitting that you're wrong
1,"I share this opinion too. Biden never truly won, I watched it happen on election night and the days after. Although because he's in office now it seems like its given Democrats a taste of what they actually voted for."
1,"Are you serious? Liberal Leftists are the ones trying to disband and overthrow the Government, The Patriots are trying to protect our Free Nation and Government. Patriots wouldn't be supporting America if they weren't supporting the United States Government. Here is the very definition of Patriotic:

"
2,"Not all of them, a lot of them yes but even some Republicans listen to the left"
1,Latest polls show it would still be a close election. That‚Äôs how much the left hates Trump. They would rather vote for the second worst possible person for the job that ran as a democrat.
1,"I saw it happen with my own eyes, in Pennsylvania at my local voting place.  We were given the paper ballots and told to fill in our choices with black sharpies, then slide the ballot into this machine that supposedly read the ballots.  The problem was, the sharpies were bleeding through the front-and-back ballots leaving numerous ""extra"" sharpie circles.  Several of us demanded new ballots that we would fill in with regular pens but were told NO, we had to do it their way.  There's no way that any ballot reader machine was getting the correct reading on those ballots.  This was in a top critical county that went Trump in 2016 that normally leans slightly left so no surprise they went out of their way to cheat."
2,"I do notice they show the teleprompter when trump is talking, whereas they don‚Äôt when Biden is talking."
1,"Auxilary, this Subreddit is for Republicans to discuss issues relating to the Republican Party, you have no right to come into our Domain and try to silence us, not to mention making an uncalled for, personal attack on a Reddit user for their username.
  

  
You may think what we say and do here is Incoherent and that's completely fine, but this is our domain and so you can't tell us to stop. Just like if I were to go over to the Democratic Subreddit and start spamming Trump 2024, which I wouldn't do because I'm sensible and formal unlike you are being right now."
1,"Combination of that, but even moreso the fact that the Dems have morphed into a party that doesn't care about morals, truth, facts, or results..  And are obsessed with handouts, freebies, white racism, and wokeism.  They've successfully managed to delude the younger generation on all this. 

So they're going to get at least 45-50% of the vote no matter who is running."

1,"why is the left so determined to repress  ANY alternative to mainstream treatment for C19 , the only reason that makes sense to me big pharma has massive influence over them"
1,"If this is false I would sue for sure...cnn , fake news as always."
2,Total norm for CNN Fox ought to run a fake story about Lemon and Fredo Cuomo being closet crossdressers and Wolf Blitzer being a Deceptacon.
1,Def sue cnn then we can see what else cnn lies about
2,"It‚Äôs the use of the term ‚Äúhorse de-wormer‚Äù that is fake. Per Merck‚Äôs website, ivermectin is to be used to treat the nematodes of a certain parasite in livestock and humans. Also per their website, ‚Äúno scientific basis for potential therapeutic effect against covid 19 from pre-clinical studies. No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with covid 19. A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.‚Äù Merck is the company that created ivermectin."
1,"Of course they‚Äôre willing to lie to push a narrative. This is nothing new. 

Most all ‚Äújournalists‚Äù are far-left activists. They‚Äôll happily push anything, no matter how ridiculous, to ‚Äòprove‚Äô that anybody that doesn‚Äôt think like them is an idiot. 

And their phony ‚Äúfact-checkers‚Äù friends will gladly back them up."
1,Sue for sure. It is defamation of character. It would be an easy win. Then donate winnings to Project Veritas. Nick Sandmann won. CNN needs to be prosecuted.
2,"I guess that I am by definition a RINO given that I do vote Republican but only because they represent more of my positions than Democrats.  I'm pretty centrist politically speaking.  So, please pardon me if I'm not one of the folks this sub is supposed to be for.  But I just feel it necessary to point out how intellectually bizarre the rhetoric against Ivermectin is.

Now, I'm not an anti-vax guy.  I've had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine and have no problem getting a booster if it's necessary.  I was also one of the first people in my state to get COVID in March of last year.  But I respect everybody's choice about what to do with their own bodies.  I'm not taking a position against anyone's rights or decisions.  The point I'm making is solely to reveal what I believe to be an intellectual weakness in the anti-Ivermectin crowd's arguments.

The anti-Ivermectin crowd rails against it because it's ""not meant for humans"" and other similar arguments.  However, Ivermectin is FDA-approved for human use.  And do you know what is **not** FDA-approved?  **The vaccine.**  

So, here you have these people insulting your intelligence over the fact that some folks are taking a drug originally not meant for humans but that eventually became FDA-approved for human use and recognized as having legitimate, beneficial uses in humans.  But those same people are out there pushing crazy ideas like vaccine mandates and prison time if you don't get a substance shot into your arm that is **not** FDA-approved.  

I'm not usually one to just lay into somebody and call them dumb, but in this case, I think it's safe to say that many of these anti-Ivermectin people are, in fact, dumb.  At the very least, they fail to see the intellectual inconsistencies in their positions.  One can only assume that if those same people were diagnosed with a blood clotting disorder that they would refuse to allow a doctor to prescribe them Warfarin.  You know, since Warfarin is rat poison."
2,You may want to check Merck‚Äôs website in regards to ivermectin in regards to covid. They are the company that created ivermectin.
1,"At this point we might as well be a monarchy where the is a figure head. Our country is ran as a buisness. Import, import, import, spend, spend, spend. Money runs this country as do the corporations. Politicians are men and women trained in manipulation and word play through their education. They gain power, maybe for selfish or selfless reasoning but it always ends up with them stuffing their pockets. 

How else you think things dimwitted democrats have such money? Pelosi is worth over $100m. She didn't get that by GIVING like they all say they want us to do. Big pharma and many, many other corporations pay them off. They talk about being Sweden or Switzerland but that'll never happen when you run a poorly managed buisness where more money leaves what its ment for to go to pockets of assholery. 

Sorry for the rant. Been alittle wound up recently."
2,It is 100% idk msm is claiming people are doing this. A hospital had to come out and deny that a doctor said they could not accept gunshot patients sue to beds being full of people who died in this.
2,"The Pfizer vaccine is FDA approved though, at least for ages 16+"
2,"You almost had it then lost it in the second paragraph.  Corruption runs deep in congress. Not a left side or right side. NRA, oil and fuel companies funds GOP .  Green energy  pharm funds the left. Problem is no term limits. Problem is the middle class and lower class working people cant afford to donate $10k to their representatives to keep them in a seat in congress. So what does congress do? Look to the top 1% for funds. In return, bills and laws are passed that are more in line with corporations than in line with we the people. Our donations are petty and not enough for them. 

Our founding fathers warned us of a two party system. Its destroying our country.  Last time this country came together was/2001. There was no hate against race, religion and sex within America against  each other. that didn't matter. Now we cant even come together for a virus thats making millions of people sick making 10s of thousands of people die. My parents were and still is trump supporters but they still took their chance on science  and took the vax.

My opinion. Our country is more in line with Corporatocracy than anything else."
1,"yeah its sad people dont wonder where people like Pelosi life long grifters worthless insects , that have done ZERO worth mentioning , get so much money from ,"
1,"The rest aren't, though, which is the whole point.  The whole ""get the vaccine"" crowd have pushed any vaccine you can get your hands on.  And they've been doing it since well before the Pfizer vaccine was approved, so the fact that it is approved now doesn't give them a leg to stand on.  They still pushed experimental substances that were not FDA-approved to be forced on people while using disgusting rhetoric against people who tried other experimental treatments.  It was always an intellectually dishonest position."

2,"I honestly don't think it is going to have much of an impact. I deal with hiring in Florida where the extra benefits were gone over 2 months ago, and it has only gotten more scarce. Way more scarce if I am honest.

I would assume it extends variably to the rest of the country, but only speaking for my area, the major problem seems to be key industries not recovering fully hold back others. The biggest one I hear from prospects  is childcare. Many childcare facilities that existed pre-covid don't exist now. And the ones that do charge significantly more than they did before, because supply is low and demand is high, so they can easily. Everyone knows childcare is expensive, but when it goes up 30 or 50 or 100% or more over a year, many of the people who were working just dont make sense anymore unless they get a raise or a different job, and thats IF you can find one that can and will take your money. Theres waiting lists everywhere for childcare.

There's been a return somewhat to having a stay at home mom or dad in many families because working where they worked before is now negative money. Our economy has been used to having more adults in the labor force, as opposed to a single household earner. A return to that in any significant percentage easily continues the trend we are in now. Low supply and crazy demand."

After I got laid off, I qualified for a state program that I used to go back to school 100% paid for, and have about a year left until I graduate. Trying to find work in the IT field with no experience is tough though."
2,I just wanna know what all these fucking Marines are gonna do to keep busy...

1,"This is not the time to spike the football.  Unemployment benefits are a smokescreen wedge issue that Democrats are going to use to climb back over the ledge that Afghanistan, COVID and the economy pushed them off.  The campaign ads write themselves: ""Republicans want people off benefits so they can go back to the jobs that are in demand: servile, demeaning unskilled labor that keep people in a cycle of poverty for generations.""  Instead of letting the clock run out, maybe conservatives should have come together to push policy that expanded the middle class.  That way, when Democrats did block it (because it has Republican names on it), they would have to eat more shit at the ballot box.  Instead, our guys handed them a W, it's fucking retarded."

Maybe some of these people already had this golem in them and these benefits just fed into it more. Maybe some of these people were hard workers and developed this golem because of the hardy benefits. Whatever this case, the government should be held accountable for this, but they won‚Äôt."

> People are tired of the working conditions and expectations that have developed, and have finally discovered their worth as employees, 

Financially you are only worth what someone else is willing to pay you. You don‚Äôt get to determine your own financial worth. Otherwise, I‚Äôd determine my financial worth to be $10 Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have any skills that are worth $10 therefore no one values my financial worth at $10  

> People want to be able to survive and be happy without having to kill themselves working 70 hours a week. 

Then get a new job. If working 70 hrs a week is not paying for your needs, you either need to reduce your expenses or get a higher paying job. A few years ago I was making I didn‚Äôt like making that little money. I decided I wanted to make more money. I went on google and looked up high paying jobs. I found one area  that was high paying that I was relatively interested in, and I googled what qualifications I needed to get one of those jobs. For this specific job, it was a specific college degree. Now it doesn‚Äôt have to be a college degree, for some high paying jobs it could be trade school, a software coding boot camp, a certification program, etc. But for this specific job, it was a specific college degree. I then decided to go to school to get this degree. It sucked, and between school and my job I was putting in 70-90 depending on the week. I had no life whatsoever for 4 years, and like I said, it sucked. But it was totally worth it. I now work in the industry that I had originally researched. 

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the pay for your current job, you need to get a higher paying job. In order to get a higher paying job, you need to acquire a skillset that people will be willing to pay you money for. Like I said above, this doesn‚Äôt have to be school, as school can be expensive. However, there are plenty of affordable ways to attend school, and I am perfectly happy to share these with you (or anyone else) if you care, and I would love to help. Regardless, trade schools and certification programs can also be great ways to increase your skillset.

> People want to be able to retire comfortably without having a $100k salary their whole life. People want to work to live, not live to work. 

You don‚Äôt need anywhere close to a salary for your whole life in order to retire comfortably. You can retire comfortably on far less (I guess it depends on what your definition of comfortable is). Again, if you (or anyone else) wants more information on how to do this, please let me know, or visit It‚Äôs really not difficult at all, and I‚Äôd love to help where I can.

2,"Thanks for the reading suggestion.
I, too, have been skeptical about the financing method of UBI, and it's a semi absurd concept for me. Europe already has quite extensive basic income systems, but they are bound to conditions. A few countries have UBI test phases from time to time.
I think it's an interesting concept and am interested to see how it will work out.

I can somewhat relate to many if these topics, because i changed workplaces during lockdown for a job that sounded less prestigious on paper, but pay was significantly better, more time off, more benefits, less micromanagement, less pressure ""from above"". And that functions quite as well.
I understand you can't have all the benefits in every job, and sometimes you'll need minimum wage to mop up the floor or something, but everyone need to finde their niche where they can lead a fulfilling life."

1,">The basis behind anti work is just providing the bare minimum shelter, food, healthcare to everyone so they're not 'forced' to work.

Everything essential for living could be provided to an individual but work would still absolutely be required. In fact it would no longer be optional at all. when services are provided for free what incentive is there to do it? I don't know how many people would work in a warehouse for free and the same goes for teachers, doctors, surgeons. These are absolutely essential positions that now need to be assigned rather than staffed voluntarily. You can't just not pay these people.

You can advocate for a higher wages thats fine, but removing or severely reducing salary *(Which would absolutely be necessary in a gov. controlled scenario)* has dire consequences. This is why the USSR had so many problems. Magnitogorsk is a prime example. So many people died in that industrial hell hole due to the sever lack of any real experience since they just assigned random people to work in the mines & foundries. I mean imagine being told to work as an ER tech with no option to leave or find another job else where.

In any scenario where a large group of people are permitted to contribute nothing to society. There is other which must suffer greatly to provide it. If you can't see that your either an idiot or don't want to acknowledge it.

0,"See, exploitation shouldn't be allowed under law. Even you should know that legality ‚â† morality. The least that we're calling for is a mandatory democratic workplace. Workers owning their workplace, and voting on everything that a CEO or manager would just dictate. Need more window cleaner in your department? Vote on it, instead of risking your shitty manager saying no to a necessary item for your work. Job too complex to function without a managerial position? Vote for someone to act as manager. If they get shitty, vote them out. Vote on your pay. Vote on expansion. Vote on recruits. 

We're just asking for democracy. The freedom to vote on things that affect you on a personal level.

This capitalist society we've been living in isn't democratic. The democracy we slapped onto our government system is just a bandaid, or more like a blind, to hide the fact that our real overlords aren't the politicians we vote for, but the  billionaires that buy the politicians that we vote for. And we can't vote on who's a billionaire. Our system is extremely autocratic.

Agree with u again, financial worth isn‚Äôt decided by you, it‚Äôs decided by the people paying you, and companies make less money the more they pay their employees. No one should be working for an unliveable wage, and since minimum wage hasn‚Äôt exactly continued to be proportional to the cost of living, many people ARE working for less than their worth. People are realizing they are worth more, and hopefully more and more people will realize in the near future. Maybe you don‚Äôt deserve a  $10 million salary, but you certainly deserve more than you make now, as does everyone else on the fucking planet. Your concept of financial worth works, but the people on the other side think everyone is worth pay as little as they can get away with.

Not everyone can just go work 70-90 hours of work or school, and I think the ‚Äújust get a job‚Äù argument is one of the dumbest and most impractical pieces of advice. Not only is the recruiting process hell for everyone, but especially the disadvantaged. Now I‚Äôm glad that you were able to go to school and get what you wanted, but there is no reality where a significant amount of people could do that. Do you really imagine people unhappy with their job haven‚Äôt considered getting a different one? I apologize but this point of contention is bare bones, shallow, and downright ignorant.

I will say your tbh about 40 hours not being that much absolutely decimated my original statement regarding a 40 hour week. You‚Äôre absolutely right, people who only work of the day 5 days a week deserve to be treated like shit by their employers, and since they don‚Äôt work weekends, why do they deserve a reasonable wage amiright???"
2,"The problems with UBI as it has been marketed in the US, are twofold: 

1. They are talking about it as a replacement for Welfare - and the current welfare systems are far more lucrative for the recipients.  People will not voluntarily switch.  If forced to switch, they will riot.

A lot of homeless just seem mental and desperately in need of help. I'm completely for getting these people off the streets it's fucking depressing and annoying. I don't think they deserve incarceration.

Because social welfare temporarily eclipsed what they could make by actually working. The greater the social welfare received by all the more people will be affected. If given the option most would rather settle than work for additional benefits. 

The real kicker is the less people work the more expensive basic goods would become. Since they need to encourage people to work who otherwise don't need too. The new cost of living would require an increase in social welfare provided creating a cycle until provider just gives up. The only solution here would be to mandate people work or directly assign them which kind of defeats the purpose of your above scenario."

I can tell you that the folks believe that extracting profit from a laborer is exploitation, and that's why they hate working in the current system.

It's not fulfilling to have your boss take upwards of 80% of the money you make for them. I can attest to that. Quite frankly, it's soul crushing.

1,"> If i understand you correctly, the problem with 1. seem more of a social issue than economic issue.

No, its economic.  The amount Yang was talking about was $1000 per month, and Yang was talking about getting people off welfare by moving them to UBI.  Very few people can live off $12,000 per year, so they'd still need to have another source of income.  Nobody would voluntarily switch from welfare to UBI - they make far more on welfare - and if forced, they would riot.  So we're talking about UBI *in addition to* welfare.

> And with 2. has it been calculated before?

328 million people times $1000 per month is $4 trillion per year - which just happens to be about the same as our total Federal revenues.  It would leave nothing left to pay for the rest of government.  Even getting rid of welfare would just reduce the amount of programs you can't pay for.

It is really doomed.  It has been tried, and the effects were exactly what conservatives warned about.  If the amount was high enough to live on, not only was it even less affordable, people simply stopped working."

1,"Not to belittle a tragedy but the people killed by covid make up an extremely small percentage of the population. The US is home to over 328 million people. Total cases over the entire pandemic is only 40 million. The covide death toll is absolutely not responsible for the labor shortage. 

To provide an example where a large event did cause some labor problems look at WW1. The war depopulated entire villages, but even that was due in large part to poor conscription and assignment practices. It saw around 20 million dead spread across Europe and other participating nations.

The black death also caused some labor shortages, but again it killed way more people. Estimated around 25 million.

The problems you cited above are a result of not having enough people to staff the restaurant. They are unable to function at full capacity with only a skeleton crew assuming they even have enough people to open in the first place.

2,And they supposably want to hand out another 2k to almost everyone. What good is giving away money if it's worthless because of the inevitable hyper uncrease in inflation.
1,"It's stealing from those of us with savings rather than debt, and those who are retired.  So as usual, punishing success and rewarding failure."
2,"How is this stealing from those with savings and the retired?? Seniors will be taken care of in this bill, and I understand the ultra wealthy will be a tax break.. these are good things right?"
2,"When the government spends this massive an amount of money, they are borrowing or conjuring up money in some way.  Those dollars now compete with our dollars in the market for the same goods.  Supply of money is up, demand for goods is up due to government spending, leading to of the dollars in people's savings and retirement funds.   Those in or near retirement are typically on fixed incomes or invested in less volatile, lower return assets such that they can't keep up with high inflation.  Those in the workforce and earlier in thier investing years are invested in riskier assets who's return is more likely keep up with inflation and in theory their wages rise with inflation (in theory...). In any case, every dollar you have is worth less, and every dollar you have borrowed and spent is also worth less.  Reducing your effective debt if you're in the red, but harming your savings if you are not.

The ultra wealthy primary have money in corporations whos assets and value are pretty well hedged against inflation.  It won't harm them, it'll mostly harm middle to upper-middle class."
1,"So, what is the avenue of change that limits our government from the u.s. dollar? Government spending and tax breaks for the ultra rich seems to be a problem that we have to deal with.  Spending money on needles wars that go to the military industrial complex seems to be a moot point in all this. How can we get rid of special interests stealing from normal folks? Do we not target corporate interests in how they do business in the U.S. and beyond? Shall we make folks like Bezos and Musk pay more taxes to offset this spiral?"
2,"If you took 200 billion from Bezos and just handed it out to all US citizens, it would be about $600 per person, one-time.  It wouldn't change anything drastically.  The scale of government spending is so far beyond the ultra wealthy it's obscene.  My point is the ultra wealthy are not the problem or the solution.  They're an inevitable result of a global economy in my view.  They aren't necessarily evil or good, but one thing that's pretty universal is that they have changed the world on a global scale.

The exception to the above being when special interests and lobbyists are pushing policy not in our best interest with billionaire dollars driving policy.  We used to call that corruption or at least a conflict of interest or ethics violation.

I have no idea how to fix it, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, so hold my beer:

1) Remove the power and money from DC by drastically decreasing federal spending and returning power to the states.  I'm thinking decentralization of this power makes it harder to corrupt and more accountable to the people.

2) Cryptocurrency may be a game changer.  I'm sure with its own set of unforseen consequences.


I don't know what the numbers are currently, but Biden was proposing something like 10 trillion in spending over the coming years.  For my household, of which, I'm the only income earner, if we naively just divide 10 trillion by 330 million citizens, then multiple by the number in my household, that's about 150,000 the government is spending of my earnings, on my behalf.  The reality is worse, because the bottom 50% aren't effectively paying federal income tax (though of course they pay other taxes).  I'm sorry, I have better things to spend on than supporting bloated, inefficient government.  That's only proposed new federal spending, I already pay property tax, sales tax, gas tax (presumably for 'infrastructure'), local income tax, state income tax, medicare, social security, and the corporate taxes, etc built into the good we buy.

All things considered, the bureaucrats are probably really close to controlling more of the wealth we produce than we are.  I am not against all taxes, but the way I see it the bureaucracy in DC is effectively a parasite which is bleeding us dry with debt and wasteful spending.  I don't know where all that money goes, but I'm certain obscene amounts are being wasted or even being spent on causes directly opposed to the interests of the citizens paying for this mess."

1,"Fauci was well aware that specific research into bat cornovirus was taking place at the Wuhan Virology Institute. He specifically approved funding of this type of research. Yet, early in the pandemic he pushed the line that the virus spontaneously popped up in a wet market in the same frigging city where they were studying this specific thing. 

He knew, he lied, and he may very well have been the cause of the entire massive catastrophe that COVID19 and will forever be.  It's not a stretch to make this claim. 

It is entirely possible that the man who was instrumental causing the deaths of over 4.5 million people and the loss of trillions of dollars in economic activity is in fact the same man that is being celebrated as a hero by people like Trevor Noah, John Oliver and others. In fact, there appears to be solid evidence to this.

Someone needs to ask him why he pushed the story that COVID 19 developed in nature when he was very well aware that research into that specific type of very unique virus was being funded by the NIH in the city where the virus originated."

With the first two, the Trump campaign used messaging that spoke specifically  to those groups. Acknowledging their history, and issues specific to them. In contrast the Dems reached out to those groups as members of the ""BIPOC"" Community. The idea of BIPOC people as a group was created by the left and is defined by their ""shared oppression"". This allowed Trump to win groups which republicans never won.

Trump was able to blunt the Dem edge with black men both through his personal appeal and superior messaging. Saying, if I'm president the economy will be so good you can get rich. But again the Dems just lumped them under the BIPOC label and told them if you like trump you're not black.

In conclusion Trump was able to either blunt the Dem edge or win outright with specific minority groups by tailoring messaging for those groups and giving them an optimistic as opposed to a pessimistic message.  The takeaway is that Trump's approach is replicable and useful, but requires significant investments in crafting proper messaging and finding the right groups to target."
2,Biden recently put some visa restriction on people involved in the current genocide against the Tirgray and Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia. There's currently debate around a house resolution(H.R 445) to formally condemn Ethiopia and Eretria for genocide and crimes against humanity. Pompeo and Inhofe are lobbying on behalf of the Ethiopian and Eritrean government in opposition to Biden and most of congress.
1,"Great question. Sorry for not including information (this is something that is practically common knowledge in my circle - apologies)

See [

Also Twitter is a good metric as well [ 

Currently there is 0 coverage from MSM - in fact any coverage is anti-Ethiopia pro-interventionist (akin to Libya).

Here are some sources to why I thanked Senator Jim Inhofe & Sec. Pompeo.

* [Jim Inhofe](
* [Mike Pompeo]("
2,"The sad fact is that the narrative of ""Tigray Genocide""  has successfully reached the international audience, despite the facts on the ground.

* Cause of war was the Nov 4th attack by the TPLF (Tigray People's Liberation Front) - the ousted former ruling party of Ethiopia for over 30 years (BAD DUDES).
* Amharas have been ethnically cleansed from many areas  (Wollega, Mai Kadra, Chena, Agmasa, etc...)
* TPLF using Child Soldiers to continue their crusade in Afar & Amhara regions.

Yet TPLF has rebranded it's name (in name only) to TDF)and cries genocide while killing civilians of all ethnicities (Crocodile tears). 

In Ethiopia, there are 80+ ethnicities. Yet, TPLF (The Tigray Rebels) are literally the only faction which is actually using ethnicity as a target - yet you probably don't hear these narratives."
2,The MSM has [posted]( about the atrocities committed in Ethiopia.
1,"I haven't came across this NPR article - thanks for correcting my hyperbole.

Most outlets that reaches our circle Amnesty International, CNN, NYTimes, BBC, & The Telegraph has reported one sided stories that coverup or sympathize with the TPLF (the aggressor) by appealing to their ethnic base despite them even targeting their own who disagree.

Let me just give you a glimpse to what I'm referring to:

* NYTimes + Senator Coons makeup stories to blame the Ethiopian PM as cause.
   * [
* The Telegraph jumping through hoops to blame Ethiopians of Genocide.
   * [

There is so so so much more - if you know an Ethiopian talk to them and they'll tell you. At the moment MSM isn't reporting the facts (at best cherry picking & downplaying). I'll be doing my best to TLDR the series of events - I'm just one dude trying to clear the misinformation.

Seriously talk to an Ethiopian. Ask them about news coverage. Ask them about the Democratic Party & Biden. If what I say is a lie you'll see it reflected in their words.

Promise I'll centralize all the info. Currently, misdeeds are lost in Tweets & Local News - this shit is much deeper than they tell you."
1,I have a coworker who‚Äôs not from Ethiopia but her parents are. The way she tells it is that it started out as basically a group wanting their own freedom and then the bigger government coming in and squashing the attempts. So the little guys started taking hostages and killing civilians Vietnam style and then big government started ethnic cleansing. Basically just sounds fucked up all around.
2,"Unfortunately, you'll hear 2 stories and it's mostly divided on ethnic lines and allegiance.

If they're from Tigray (most likely but not universal) will tell you that story you shared.

Ethiopia has 80+ Ethnicities, but one political group (from Tigray) is trying to make a comeback after being ousted from power - after 30 years of being the ruling party. The TPLF is not a small guy - it's literally a political group that has used Racism to divide Ethiopia.

TPLF's aim is to make itself look like the good guy using it's operatives across the world. They are a rich & extremely corrupt group that got the boot due to a popular uprising.

Democracy has emerged; and ethno nationalism (their bread & butter) is under threat.

Imagine having the US dividing states based on ethnic lines (like This is for Whites Only, This is for Blacks Only, etc...) That's who they are... racism is a political opinion in their mind :)

Here's a joke

* Republican talks about race... they're a racist
* TPLF kills, borders & imprisons based on race... they're a fledgling democracy
* ^ That truly happened (Susan Rice & Barack Obama said that) ["

1,He‚Äôs kneeling because he fantasizes about being the cop that did it.
1,Dems are the most spiteful obstinate group of reckless and morally corrupt people. All they want is to devastate the core foundations of decency all because someone they courted back in the early 2000s decided to not play ball with them and instead ran as their opposition.

Right, because that's remotely in the same ballpark. Biden got these people killed, then couldn't be bothered to show an ounce of decorum for the 45 minute ceremony. He then went on to roll his eyes at the mother of one of the dead marines, among other things, and wouldn't shut up about his own son."
1,"Haha seriously? You have the Commander in Chief and hes checking the time instead of respecting the fallen soldiers of his FAILED PLAN. Yes, President Trump was going to evacuate the troops but sleepy Joe had no plan. He fucked up, he disrespected the fallen soldiers for making sure it wasnt time to take his dementia medication. Joe is a joke."

In the case of Floyd. It‚Äôs well documented that he should not have used that amount of force. Digging up someone‚Äôs past to try and justify it after the fact doesn‚Äôt work."

If you haven't been living under a rock you'd understand that this was a forever war and nobody was going to pull out perfectly.  20 years, hundreds of thousands of lives lost, yet all you care to critique are the few thousand people warned to leave that didn't and 12 of the thousands of soldiers that have already died?  The entire last decade was a disgrace and you can scrutinize the actions of the last 3 presidents but *this one* ooooh this one really screwed the pooch?  Grow up"
1,"Oh, adding in extras to move the goalposts?  The initial critique was a still image, which in sure you'll agree are extremely easily taken out of context... honestly I'm my opinion you and I and every American got those soldiers killed, along with the thousands of other US soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Afghan soldiers that have died over the last two decades for supporting this war not just in the first place but along the way.  There was *never* going to be a clean pull out no matter who was in office. Period. 

The difference here is that Sundowning Irish Joe (or likely the people around him) saw that he doesn't seem to care or realize there's an election coming up so they ended it."
1,"Your argument re: Babbitt would be correct, IF she had actually crossed through the doorway - she had not, he shot her THROUGH the doorway and she fell on the other side of the door because she had not crossed through at that point

Home owners have been prosecuted for shooting through the doorway at someone attempting to crash through their door - there is fear, but insufficient fear of imminent death or great bodily harm as long as the aggressor is on the OTHER side of the door (like Babbitt)"
2,He was a junkie who robbed a pregnant woman by holding a gun to her belly. We'd be calling him a total pos no matter what color they are. Stop being stupid
2,Politicians made a movie out of him
1,"The Dumbocrats don't care about ANYONE except themselves - sure, it's virtue signaling for political brownie points - doesn't make it any less vile"
2,"> If you're not an American, frankly, I don't give a damn. 

Maybe you forgot that it wasn't only American troops fighting in Afghanistan. Coalition forces had soldiers from many other nations. For example the British had close to 500 dead, the Italians 100ish, etc etc (and many more were wounded and will most likely suffer the consequences of that for the rest of their lives). You're spitting on their graves with that statement. Have a modicum of empathy, for fuck's sake."
2,"I sense hostility. No need for that.

We need to clear a couple of things: first, this is not about the war in Afghanistan as a whole. Second, this is not about drawing comparisons between Biden and the last three presidents, it's about this one particular instance.

I understand why my opinion may not matter to you, because this is your country, not mine. And I respect that. I have always respected Americans for their patriotism.

It's also absolutely fine to discuss different opinions. Mine, for instance, is that an American president should be more mindful of his behavior. Yours may be different.

Let's come together, and in words of Joe Biden during his inauguration speech, ""We can treat each other with dignity and respect""."
2,"Yeah,  because it's not like there were blockades and checkpoints preventing Americans from leaving right?"
2,Another thing I forgot to add. Shooting through a closed door isn‚Äôt the same as a police officer defending congressmen as they evacuate the building. Seems like we have slightly different views but I really appreciate you keeping it light as opposed to immediately name calling and cursing like a lot of folks do
2,But we are the racists they are the communist Marxist
2,Just because I don‚Äôt believe the same thing you do doesn‚Äôt make me a liberal. You‚Äôre welcome to review my comment history I‚Äôm on here a lot. I just keep call out people the few times I feel it‚Äôs necessary
2,"The blockades that prevented Americans from getting through were at the airport gate and staffed by the US military.

What is preventing 6 planeloads of people - including Americans - from leaving right now, is the US State Department."
2,Case law has been consistent - until the aggressor is actually on the other side of a doorway and capable of presenting real imminent threat - it's not justified to shoot
1,"Except there were in fact no congressmen in the building - it had already been emptied when this happened

Recall that AOC was in a completely different building - later claiming she had to hide in her bathroom because people were going to her - even though there was absolutely no one there"
1,I lost my lunatic-lefty cherry back at the end of 2015
2,">   The initial critique was a still image,  which in sure you'll agree are extremely easily taken out of context

So you both want to dismiss the image for having no context, then whine about someone introducing additional context? That's... an interesting take.

> you brought in additional evidence that was not part of the initial argument, moving the goal posts.

Kudos for showing you can read but not comprehend, and are so lacking understanding that you think introducing evidence in a debate is a logical fallacy. That's absolutely precious."
2,"I just rewatched the video again. 



I‚Äôm not going to pretend I have any knowledge whatsoever about case law or anything castle doctrine. I‚Äôm just a guy on Reddit. 

What I see is a justified shooting. Since the officer was cleared of the shooting I‚Äôm guessing others thought that as well."
2,"This is a statement from Chief of Police following that day 

‚ÄúAs protesters were forcing their way toward the House Chamber where Members of Congress were sheltering in place, a sworn USCP employee discharged their service weapon, striking an adult female.  Medical assistance was rendered immediately, and the female was transported to the hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries.  She has been identified as Ashli Babbitt.‚Äù"
2,Yeah I do know about the AOC thing. But I‚Äôm under the impression that there were a few reps In the ‚Äúgallery of House of Representatives‚Äù is that not in the same building?
2,"This isn't castle doctrine related - the only issue in situation like this is whether the cop had a legitimate fear for IMMINENT death or great bodily harm - in the process or climbing through a window isn't there yet - imminence doesn't accrue until the person is on your side of the door and in a position to cause imminent harm

Officer was ""cleared"" of the shooting by the Capitol Hill police - of course he was

That's like the Chicago Police having initially cleared the dumbass who illegally shot that Laquan McDonald buffoon"
0,What threat did an unarmed woman pose to an armed secret service officer. He could have fired a warning shot or he could have moved to arrest her when she came through the window. There was also a swat team at babits rear coming up the stairs which I imagine had contact via radio with the shooter. You can see them signal eachother with a thumbs up after the shot
2,"The standard CYA statement - like the CPD tried in the McDonald (and a lot of other) cases

They were ""sheltering in place"" in a completely OTHER building - video that was shown of the chamber at the time shows it was empty"
2,"> in the process or climbing through a window isn't there yet - imminence doesn't accrue until the person is on your side of the door and in a position to cause imminent harm

Particularly given that there was a second door between them."
2,"People who‚Äôs job is to decide whether lethal force or not is authorized chose to acquit the officer. I‚Äôm going to side with them. 

You also just used the exact same argument that the loved ones of Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, and countless others have used. Did you defend them the same way?"

2,This is a really beautiful quote. I think if we could approach conversations from this perspective both sides could accomplish a lot more.
1,"Modern Democrats often confuse disagreeing with the solution with disagreeing that there's a problem. Take for example climate change. There's a vast majority that believe in it... We just don't believe we can get our way out of climate issues with wind turbines and solar panels, and wished that you just let us finishing building more nuclear like Republicans wanted to back in the 70s"

2,"if we judged policies on results instead of goals, half of the disagreements would solve themselves"
1,"We have better answers than liberals do, and they know that, which is why they make an entirely emotional argument rather than trying to argue policy."
0,"Liberals : okay, time to boycott and censor this obviously racist washed up actor"
1,"Actually it is a difference in heart. They don‚Äôt care about people, only power. Why else would they want to restrict us, then open our borders to illegal immigrants coming in with a 40% COVID case rate?"
2,"It also does not help that clean, cheap, easy-to-refuel reactors could have been a thing back in the '40s and '50s but were not because Admiral Hyman Rickover didn't want anything nuclear that did NOT generate plutonium.

Several great reactor designs that cannot melt down were created. In the event of failure, they shut the reaction off. Most of them ran on thorium salts and not uranium. Therefore, no plutonium.

That made the Admiral unhappy because no plutonium = no big booms."
2,"Unfortunately, a large part of our party does not hold this view.  I, however, am on your side and believe environmentalism and environmental stewardship is a bi-partisan issue that we all can agree on in some form"
2,"But the reason why it ended up as the 1st is that the original first two amendments weren't ratified.

""Our"" 1st amendment wasn't listed first by Congress because it it was so important, it was originally the 3rd of the first 12 amendments.

The states didn't ratify the first two amendments, so 3 became 1."
2,"It's more about the people - not the government. For citizens who vote liberal or conservative, it's often a difference in mind. For government officials... sometimes it's a bit questionable."
2,"Conservatives might say it's liberals that are hurting people.

Unlike some other political arguments in the past, mosern-day politics aren't just about ""we both know the facts but have different opinions"" - instead they're about ""we both believe different facts, and thus, different opinions.""

The worst part is, the side who's wrong will believe 100% that they are right. So there's no way to truly know who is right and who is wrong."
2,"Oh you mean like by forcing small businesses around the country to close down permanently, killing competition and crushing the economy, causing crime, homelessness, suicide, preventable disease and third-world starvation to skyrocket?"
2,"Yes I agree, and I don't like it.

That being said, it's been far easier for me as a nuclear advocate to convince a right winger to support nuclear power than to have a left winger support nuclear.

The left bludgeoned the right with emotional appeal and NIMBYism to shut down our stance on nuclear in the general public, meaning that the only options left if you knew solar and wind wouldn't do anything would be to either be silent and keep voting... Or throw your hands in the air. It's so easy to bring right wing republicans who don't believe in climate change back to believing in reasonable stances on environmentalism as long as A) it's incremental and B) you validate their concerns. Same thing I've done with most topics.

And, to be honest, if the right says don't spend money and not solve the problem, and the left says spend more money on something that won't solve the problem... I think not spending money is still a better option.

It's so irritating if you look at it and see how the the nuclear regulatory commission called a lot of the anti nuclear attacks ""leftist trash"" all the way back in the 80s. If they let us keep going we would have been like France and this wouldn't have been an issue."
2,"As a hard left winger, yeah yeah I know, not supposed to post, I actually agree with your stance on nuclear and also support nuclear power. I really think the energy generation stuff is a problem on both sides... with dumb republicans talking about bringing back coal as a major energy source, and dumb people on my side shutting down ideas like nuclear as efficient ways of generating clean energy.

The problem with don't spend money and don't solve the problem is no steps are being made towards solving the problem. Not saying spending money is great, but it can at least create progress to a solution if well managed.

Now whether you think the left can manage it well is of course a valid concern... I also believe government is wasteful and stupid in many situations after all."
2,"To be fair, I‚Äôm somewhat left leaning and super into nuclear.  It‚Äôs not a lost cause.  I actually find a lot of the older more conservative men who don‚Äôt know much about nuclear are the ones still quite nervous about it!"
2,"Hey man, in this polarized time I'm happy to find common ground. One of my best friends since I moved to GA is a traditional auth left guy, and when we have to talk politics that's our common ground we loop back to.

It is true both sides have their derps, we just need to reel them in. I remember being 'shut down' by someone on the left calling me a climate change denier because I said renewables can't fill our energy needs.

And I get that nothing is being done if you do nothing... But sometimes if you're given two shitty options I'd rather we do the least shitty one. 

As an example, let's say we told two people to each pick up a cinder block and carry it 100m east. If one person is fiddling with the block and then walking 30m south, and the other is kind of sitting there... That would mean the person sitting there is putting us in a better position.  That's how I view it; if we spend ungodly sums of money in renewable tech that won't solve the problem were essentially wasting money. Don't get me wrong, I think the gov should be, in general, supporting tech advancements... But we need to prioritize. If we took half the renewable funds and gave it to the scientists and engineers trying to make  nuclear stations cheaper or faster to construct, it would have actually made a dent.

Cheers to finding common ground, from a right winger to a left winger!"
1,"Not to keep pointing fingers back and forth, but the resistance to nuclear power really is a primarily left-wing phenomenon in politics. The sooner we all get behind it though, the better!"
2,I could see why. Nuclear is a clean and reliable power source but accidents do happen
2,"Yep, you guys just also have to work on your older conservative ally‚Äôs that really only have poor knowledge of the (mostly man made) disasters of the past.  People like me will work the left. 
Most libs I know are in favour of a *diverse* energy economy.  More wind, yes. More solar, yes. Nuclear additions, yes. nationally refined oil products, yes.  Not everyone left wing is ultra progressive, just like not everyone right wing is alt-right extreme. There‚Äôs a middle ground somewhere with a lot of overlap on these issues."
2,"In the documentaries I‚Äôve watched, the ‚Äòmajor‚Äô accidents have been due to negligence.   I‚Äôm definitely open to links citing otherwise, however, it‚Äôs my understanding that Chernobyl for example was a direct result of plant management ignoring power source protocols and straight up causing an avoidable disaster (trying to cover it up obviously didn‚Äôt help) and 3 mile island for another example, was the result of a leak that was not registered by any sort of sensor or properly maintained and was an entirely avoidable incident in itself as well.  Sadly, communication technology wasn‚Äôt at the level it has been at for the last couple decades to lead to faster, more experienced troubleshooting either.  Both examples are tragic and damaging to the psyche, but, when studied, the argument of how dangerous they are lessens as the argument for human error grows."
2,"Exactly. I was literally just watching a Chernobyl technical documentary last night and it explained what happened and why. The engineers allowed the nuclear reactor to enter an unstable state without realizing what had happened, and then had pulled too many control rods out causing the reactor to overheat and explode"
