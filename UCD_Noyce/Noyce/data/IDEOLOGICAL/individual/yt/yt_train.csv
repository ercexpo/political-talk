2,Y wasnt this shown at frist oh Afghanistan give me a break.this fake
0,They don't deserve  a President like President Bidon. They deserve a coward  who can brainwash them.
0,"Jihad defends trump,death in the republicans"
2,It was a disgrace seeing our so called fellow Americans act like that on our Capital!!
2,"The government PAID for this? What I mean is 1+1= priceless.... the life insurance, mortgage, student loans, car titles all in rogue languages now but rainfall grows green money? Mirror images üò∂üòí"
2,"They so should have opened up with machine guns, they needed to wipe out everyone of these sick, seditious fools."
1,Trivial  in relations to the BLM-ANTIFA  summer of Nation Wide Insurrection
1,"Afghanistan: Biden abandoned Americans and our helpers to their fate at the hands of the Taliban. Get people out before drawing down our troops?---nah. Give allies Britain, France, & Germany some advance-notice that we will be abruptly abandoning them too?---Nah.

INCOMPETENCE on a breathtaking scale. Perhaps our worst foreign policy debacle ever. And to further exhibit his senility, Biden now excitedly CONGRATULATES himself about Afghanistan---how's THAT for irony? üôÑüòÅ"
2,"Ah, so, when will this misinformation be taken down? The FBI has already made a ruling on this."
2,"Also, MSNBC can freely show the video of the gun being fired and killing someone, and YT doesnt take it down, while if anyone else who isnt a large news network showed such a clip, it gets removed for violating YT's guidelines.

I can only assume that this is because A) they are MSNBC, thus they are held to different standards and rules, and B) YT actually agrees with the political message and tone, thus they allow MSNBC's coverage to run unchecked.

And this is why people hate you and want to cause violence."
2,"I love the completely "" _unbiased take_ "" of MSNBC.
This is absolute gold anyway, I wish they had succeeded. You know, buildings can actually be burned and be brought into the ground, just saying...."
1,"So bad that people were stuck inside their homes that were set on fire by people? So bad that business buildings burned? So bad that historic statues were damaged? Buildings, cars and more were vandalized? People by themselves were beaten in the streets? Nah. At least on Jan 6, the people peacefully appeared, to the location of the source of our problems. I do not support violence, vandalism or any of that, but It was Antifa and BLM that screwed it up again in this case. Made it look bad for the innocent. Not regular ordinary citizens defending their rights. Enough of Jan 6, Solve 2020 Riots first!
United We Stand, Divided We Fall! This Government has done an excellent job dividing people for their own selfish goals!"
1,"üá∫üá∏AMERICA AND FELLOW PATRIOTSüá∫üá∏ Stand for those who protect our constitution and our freedom! Too many have lost their lives defending us from foreign enemies and communist/ socialist agendas. We will never allow American soldiers to die in vein. This is the USAs future, the future our kids and grand kids. Heros have died for our constitution and our freedom,  NOW IT IS UP TO US TO MAINTAIN THAT FREEDOM! Dig up strength from deep within yourselves. These radical leftists and anti Americans (who have fallen victim to the media) will never get the best of us or our country. If anyone doesn't like it here then they can move out of the USA. PERIOD. As we already know history repeats itself.  We have already won this same war many times over. Now we just gotta do it again. Have faith and stay strong! üá∫üá∏"
2,"LOL, The US Capital building was taken over with flag poles & fire extinguishers....... Bahahahahahahhahhah"
2,"knock knock its August 27, 2022. joe biden has been the president 8 months.
hows that withdrawal from afghanistan going? american death toll 13 so far, come back here in a year or three."
0,"Be honest. Had this been a black lives matter protest, there would have been hundreds dead. Discrimination. Starting to see things differently since I married an ethnic girl."
0,Trump needs to go to prison for everything he has done. He keeps getting away with things that anybody else would be charged.  He is not a nice person on so many levels. I watched the video of more footage of the riot and I'm still in shock with what I saw. This riot was way worse than I thought
2,FBI says different.
0,Every Republican in office sould have to sit and watch the Capitol attack on large screen with high volume.  Lets see them talk about it being like a tourist visit then.
2,"In this age of LED lighting, why modern media companies still use gaslighting is a total mystery."
1,You want to see insurrection  look at Afghanistan! That is insurrection  idiots!
2,"On the heels of FBI announcing this was NOT an insurrection & that there was no central or organized plan to 'attack' the capital (without firearms or any weapons for that matter), this didn't age well. üòÜ

Maybe it was the prayer meeting they held on the Senate floor that has their panties on a bunch. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1,Signet was killed because he wouldn‚Äôt go along with a plan to stage a coup and blame it on Trump

2,Meanwhile in Moscow W. putIN smokin' a cigarr and tellin' his friends ' Love it when a PLAN comes together.'
1,Democrats :  the same people who wants to defund the police .
0,Trump lied (again)he walked nowhere near the Capitol.  He went back to watch his handiwork on T. V. In a safe environment.  Those rioters still believe in that fool.
2,FBI reports scant evidence of any coordinated plot on January 6.
2,"Cops should've shot more of them, like all of them."
2,Hitler's Fascist Government has taken over. We are headed for Orson Wells 1984 book. ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING. WELCOME TO FASCISM. WORSE THAN A DICTATORSHIP. READ THE BOOK. RESEARCH ELEMENTS OF FASCISM TO OPEN YOUR EYES AND SEE THE TRUTH.
2,"I can't stand all this bickering. It breaks my ‚ù§üíî. Politicians and Donors love this. We are distracted by hate, division and rage towards each other. üëøüò£
       Then they can pass all their Fascist Laws. Pay attention to new policies. We have been stripped of all our freedom."
1,Americans need to remember that these news agencies love to claim things that did not happen to make the rioters look even worse. Especially MSNBC. This guy here should be ashamed of himself for not staying neutral and clearly siding against Trump. In other words its biz as usual for them.  Just rem they LOVE to add this and that to try and drive home their thoughts so to speak. Pathetic
0,"why not terrorism people know terrorist, they killed 5 Americans breech the Capital of the US life all of the terrorists"
1,Only violence I saw in the clip were and ANTIFA and BLM member smashing door.  Democrats attack America with their Anti-American hate every day.
1,It is time to impeach Biden for causing the killings of Americans around the world. Americans are being killed by the cartels coming into our country with tons of drugs and creating crime nation wide. He is not competent to hold the office. He did not win the election. He has caused more destruction to our country faster than any President  that has ever served. We must remove him asap to give our country a fighting chance to save our country. Please contact  our goverment and let your voice be heard. The phone numbers you can call at the capitol to let your voice be heard is 202-224-3121   202-225-3121. These numbers will connect you with capitol switch board where you can ask to speak with the office of your state politicians. Please get Biden out now before we all pay dearly.
2,I wonder why they won't put individual one in jail are they afraid of him for some reason or is there some other reasons hint hint
0,They should all have been shot. That would send a clear message to these Trump supporters and trump and the enablers.
2,Oh wow Finally the Truth. This was very Entertaining and now let's see how Justice handled This One üò≥üò≥üò≥.
2,"First of all the PR is heavy here aha, Paid comments doesn't help. The us of hollywood here is imaculate."
2,"This country is destined for failure.  When such a large group of people attempt to overthrow the government, it won't be long before they succeed.  Democracy will be eliminated and be replaced by tryrany.   If not that, the hordes of people from countries that we have been invading for many years will descend upon us and take over just as happened in Rome.  We cannot stand together and support the principles that our wise forefathers created."

2,"WELL, WE ARE ALL DEBT-FREE AS FAR AS WE SEE, THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT FREE OF THIS GUILT, WE CALL FRAUD, EITHER. <3 For re-organizing corruption using the corruption itself. <3  With titles or narrations like this it's easy to distract others from the fact that the whole thing is ORGANIZED BY THE ONES NOT PLAYING PUPPET, AKA ""PRESIDENT.""  <3  HOW DOES ANYONE REPRESENT PEACE, WHEN YOU FIGHT IT WITH IGNORANCE, CLAIMING YOU HAVE A PEACEFUL SANCTUARY FOR US NOW?  SOUNDS MORE LIKE A PRISON. <3"

1,Don't believe everything said on MSNBC they doctor the truth with false statements and selected doctored video
1,"Why hasn't this video been pulled down once it was determined Sicknick did not get bashed on the head with an extinguisher, and that he died of natural causes unrelated to the riot.

You have no morals anymore.. only your beliefs and you try to force them onto everyone else.. Your separating people..What's going on with our country is disgusting!! Our politicians are criminals and act like children.. If people don't share your same views you use words like racist, bad people, criminals, etc.. to try and make them look less then.. unknowingly you are all acting like Hitler.. Get it together!

2,"An insightful linguistic analysis of the former inciter-to-chaos-in-chief. His most 'favorable' characteristic that Mr. McWhorter describes is ""Artful"". And it is true that he was The Showman president who we're all trying to get over, but of course the narcissist must be On Stage. Not aesthetic, though, and (for me) not artful. too much icing on the cake. The American Cake that used to be American Pie. Now it's just Yesteryear.

As for myself, what I like best is listening to President Trump insult everyone that insulted him first.... That's called ""RETALIATION"", and something I can seriously relate to when I use to be verbally bashed in grade school, and it wasn't until I reached High School when I started retaliating..... Yes, over the past 5 years, from 2016 to 2021, all I heard was the Dems & Libs bashing & bashing & bashing/365 for 4 years, and President Trump retaliating & retaliating & retaliating..... and all I saw was the Dems & Libs rioting at ""INSIDE"" the US Capital in 2017 (yes, they broke inside & rioted), and there were countless street riots all over the country during President Trumps entire term......

Ever since Nixon, conservatives agenda has been to tell the Middle Class that the poor were stealing from them, while at the same time, instituting policies that shifted the resources of this country into the hands of a few of the already very wealthy.

0,"THIS. THIS is why I tune in here, to hear the ROTpublicans try to divine the Secrets of the Capitalist Universe on their own. How do I know on their own? Because they WON'T LISTEN TO ANYONE ELSE. They won't listen to blacks of any stripe; they won't listen to Hispanics. They won't listen to women, or Libs, or Progressives, or children, or ANYONE who insists that the idea of God has to pass even the most feeble standards of discussion, or science, or even education. And why do they hyperventilate so? Because THEIR idea of what God is, can't pass even those abbreviated tests.

ROTpublicans proudly stand for ALL the rest of us, those groups I detailed above, just pulling in our unruly noses, and letting them ride roughshod over us and our priorities.

And since ROTpublicans HAVE NO MORALS to speak of, they are not willing to just go home when they DON'T HAVE THE MAJORITY. No, they've got to then STEAL the votes, by screwing up the entire voting system... and KEEPING it screwed up in a ROTpublican direction.

Our task now is to stop that from happening. Period."

Dictate whether or not a couple can decide to ADOPT because pregnancy has PROVEN to be a 'threat' to the woman's life...
2,"His comment of ""High Priest or High Priestess of abortion"" is in reference to the fast growing Pagan religions and shows his bigotry. I hope that is obvious. He is appealing to the Evangelical base. As he hypocritically says that Parties shouldn't appeal to their bases. Disgusting!"

The people need the whole truth about who Trump truly is... Everything!! All his lies and not paying anyone and the sexual abuse and any and every thing he should be in jail for but his money made him above the law like he's better then all of them!!! Everything needs to come out with proof like court records......
0,"Grumpy Old Party hardly conveys the true depth of malice that ruling Republicans are guilty of these days!. Such a cute-worded description as, ""grumpy old party"" to describe the right is like saying,. ""Yeah, they've done some bad things,  but, they meant well.""  Already there is a great problem with Republican's blatantly, shamelessly lying  and denying, plus refusing  to acknowledge the damage they have done, all to please Donald J. Trump. Please don't use endearing words to describe any of them until we know the depth of their involvement . They are a terrorist gang now, with crimes against America too numerous to mention. Many right-wing politicians became traitors on the day insurrectionists impersonated patriots as they violated America. And now for some bizarro reason-they defy helping America end the pandemic. They are willing to even put their own children's lives at stake to ""own the libs""  they say. That's not even the American thing to do.  Who are these people who think they are patriots and why don't they realize they are acting more like bullies or terrorists themselves?"

1,"I'm very optimistic for the republican party. Eventually, the republican party will part with the minority of people in their party who are militant racists, which is great. 
Trump is not a republican; he is his own entity. 
And he is causing an acceleration of change in the republican party, which I'm happy about. 
The democrats are fooling themselves if they think there are no racists in their party.
The democratic party is loaded with racists,too, I beleive. 
My hope is that the republican party will soon roll out the red carpet for conservative democrat minorities to swing to the republican party, and the core beliefs of conservatism, which starts with less government."

2,"Hey look, it's all Barack Osama ever did in his career!"
1,"A key aspect to a happy world is harmony. Harmony consists everybody. Harmony is influential. Happiness is influential. Those two things don't exist in the overall human race because of a lot of set backs. One key thing that divides the human race is the difference in ethics. Good ethics or morals are principles that contribute to Good conduct and good conduct is a positive influence that contribute to harmony. Good ethics should be universal around the earth just like a smile generally means happiness around earth.

Here's the thing. Besides all the crime and misery that contribute to this sick world that has it's negative influence, you also have loose morals (let's say loose conduct for better understanding) and loose conduct has it's negative influence. Example, parents that regularly curse around their kids might influence their kids even if they tell them not to do it. Homosexuality, is, loose, conduct. It has it's influence as you can clearly see around you in today's world. It, contributes, negatively, to, humanity. How?

Homosexuality challenges the importance of ethics, logic and reasoning. Three common things you need for wisdom and Three common things that are challenged in committing crimes like murder, domestic violence, rape etc.. When you challenge those things in regards to the ethics of sexuality, it attacks the meaning of ethics in general and attacks the human cognition like, 'if I could do this I could do even more' which could lead to recklessness. It also attacks the meaning on quality of life, like how a person experiences life. Influence effects your motivations and your mental and physical wellbeing, and it's contagious because it effects you and everyone else.

So how is homosexuality truly beneficial to those doing it and to humanity? The world is like a family household, if one thing is out of place, everything is. So we all have a part on contributing to earth and humanity, it's best to be in harmony not disarray. But this world won't be in harmony with loose conduct, that's one key reason why the world is the way it is today.

NO ONE is born Gay. There is no scientific proof that people are born Gay. There is ZERO proof. ZERO! There is not a ""Gay Gene."" This is a fairy tale. People believe deceptive lies. They say, ""Gays were born that way."" That's just as ignorant as saying, ""Child Molesters were born that way."" Or ""Thieves were born that way."" Or ""Adulterers were born that way."" HOW STUPID! WHAT A GREAT BIG LIE! NO! People are NOT born Gay. People are born with a CHOICE! People are not ""born that way."" People are born with a CHOICE! LIFE IS A CHOICE! People are born with a CHOICE! People CHOOSE right or wrong. People choose to live for God or for themselves. They CHOOSE to walk in darkness or walk in light. And people will be judged by God for the choices they make. NO! People are NOT born Gay. People are born with a CHOICE!

God's Word is perfectly clear. It says Gay, Homosexuality and Lesbianism is wrong. Gays, Homosexuals and Lesbians will not go to Heaven...they will go to Hell! [1 Cor.6:9,10]. The the sexually immoral... their place will be in the fiery Lake of Burning Sulfur."" [Rev.21:8]. God's Word calls homosexuality ""degrading of the body, shameful, indecent and perversion.""

A choice to live for themselves and their selfishness or to live for God. ""Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve."" [Josh.24:15]. People are born with a CHOICE!

You owe it to your American family members that fell at places like Gettysburg, Normandy and Iwo Jima. ¬†You owe it to your current American family and to family members not yet born and whom you will never see but most importantly, you owe it to yourself.

You are now facing the strongest opponent to American freedom that America has ever known and the odds of survival seem long. ¬†How did we succeed in the past against tyranny, oppression and assault?¬†

Some might say that we sent our former family members into battle with the best technology and resources available and they would be partly right. ¬†But our true strength has always resided in our steadfast faith in God. ¬†Our belief that our cause was just and that it was by God‚Äôs hand that we would prevail. ¬†

Let us renew that trust and faith and accept the promise of help in dark times. ¬† Let us unleash the greatest power in creation and call upon our creator to help us in the shadow of what seems to be the death of our Republic. ¬†One nation under God and in God we trust is the cornerstone of this nation.¬†

And so on Wednesday, July 8th let all God loving members of the American family and across the globe unite in prayer that first begins by acknowledging that without Jesus Christ we can do nothing and with Jesus Christ all things are possible for His glory. That in our own words we ask for guidance and direction to do our part in restoring the founding principals of this nation. ¬†And if inclined to do so, share those prayers with others by posting on YouTube. ¬† (Please share this message)"

This is why the U.S. gets so much flak, because we're a broken nation and the root of it is religion i.e, lack of reason, sheer stubbornness.

2,"The Supreme Court consists of nine justices, each one was UN-ELECTED by the people and serve life time tenures. Let me check my memory and I see there was another government entity in the last millennium ¬†that was also UN-ELECTED and served for their entire life, that‚Äôs right, a KING. History tells us what our founding fathers thought of such a government entity when they gave King George V a big ‚ÄúF ¬†you‚Äù when they signed the Declaration of Independence. Today we have ¬†a Supreme Court that is governing just like a king, using judicial decrees to make law, a form of judicial activism that has no legitimate place in the highest court of the land. If the Supreme Court wants to become a political entity of our three branches of government, of which in my opinion they have firmly established with their recent rulings, then they should be subject to the same process as the other two branches, the legislative and executive, and that is an ELECTION. No longer should Supreme Court justices be nominated by the president and then approved by the senate. These justices should be elected by the people through a national election, like any other political entity in a DEMOCRACY."

1,"Jesus condemned homosexuality when speaking about sexual immorality. [Mk.7:21-23]. He said sexual immorality makes a person unclean, defiled and polluted. This word sexual immorality means illicit and immoral sex. Which includes prostitution sex, adultery sex, incest sex, GAY or HOMOSEXUALITY sex and LESBIAN sex. Jesus said sexual immorality, which includes Homosexuality, make a person ""unclean, defiled and polluted!"" God's Word says, ""Keep the marriage bed undefiled, uncontaminated, unsoiled, for God will judge the sexual immoral."" [Heb.13:4]. God will judge the Sexually Immoral and all sex outside of the marriage bed. The marriage bed is to be uncontaminated."

1,"My entire family¬† support the ¬†democrat¬† candidates all the time , but this time we all are for Trump.

1,"Make no mistake, their son is an American hero, he made the ultimate sacrifice for this country........not the parents!

2,Wtffff ü§£ü§£ cop said fu
2,"I hope people aren't stupid enough to try to copy this. At no point was that guy actually in control of that situation. The only reason he wasn't immediately arrested is because the cop happened to be a laid back guy and decided to be patient and let him run his mouth. If anyone, white or black tried that with 99% of cops they would be in cuffs instantly. This cop is just one of the few relaxed ones out there."

2,Washington state laws have different regulations for marked and unmarked vehicles.  Marked patrol vehicles are subject rules for decals and markings. Unmarked vehicles are not subject to the same rules. Just because the officer wasn't aware of the law doesn't mean the citizen was correct about the interpretation.
2,I'm wondering how the guy got the cop to pull over! I'm surprised the cop didn't just flip him off and speed off lol.

Here in the UK one of our most famous Olympians - a household name - got pulled in a nice car and asked where he stole it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm white & educated and have been arrested once, when much younger, and refused to sign a statement written by the arresting officer because it was equivocal - I got a blank look back and told him to find a senior officer and a dictionary. I deserved a smack really, but I absolutely know that if I‚Äôd been less well educated I‚Äôd have signed the statement and ended up in trouble, and can‚Äôt imagine what kind of hell I‚Äôd have landed in had I been anything other that white & middle class.

oh, annoyed when allies help? really? this incident totally teaches about the two americas!"
2,"Gary needs to get a life. We need to hold cops accountable but harassing cops is not appropriate.

2,"Wow this happened in my state!? I hope this goes nationwide. And in our state it would have gone against the cop if he would have tried to protest. Also as a woman this how we've wound up raped or worse.
Looked up this guy. He is currently a fugitive from justice because it tried to interfere with a trial in Washington state by acting as the defendents attorney despite not having a law license.  He and his wife have fled to Mexico where our ambassador says he is behaving like a spoiled brat because he picks and chooses what laws of theirs he will obey. He insists their cops speak to him in English, he won't observe their Covid19 rules because he doesn't believe in Covid19. Oh yeah he believes in conspiracy theories and is a Libertarian."

2,"I'm proud to say i did something similar. I followed a speeding canine unit concerned that it was driving erratically and posing a  danger to other motorists without any lights blaring, and he finally pulled over. A young cop emerged and looked at my ID and asked me why i was following him. I said, ""you were going 100 and cutting people off with no lights."" I also said, ""You are the worst driver i've ever seen."" He let me go and as far as i could see he drove more carefully after that."
0,This was a great video. I like how this gentleman questioned the officer with a very strong knowledge of the use of unmarked vehicles. This is actually how a actual cop should approach a vehicle. They should walk up and say ‚Äúdo you know why I pulled you over‚Äù without drawn gun. Then they explain why. This doesn‚Äôt happen in the videos I have seen with violence. The cops assume you are a criminal and don‚Äôt tell the person what they have or may have done. It‚Äôs your a criminal and I am judging you.
2,This law was passed in 1990 so why have the officers never been taught nor charged with any kind off offence as it happens a lot!

2,So young girls in bikinis üëô üëô at the beach triggered your porn addiction. So to satisfy your self-serving perversion you approached these young women under the guise of Christ. Then because your fiance had on that wack a$$ Wonder Woman outfit you're mad? Allegedly! The only difference between them and his fiance is her bottoms. But she is showing her skins none the less. You girls should be ashamed of yourselves making him go home and watch pornüòÇüòÇüòÇ

0,Typical religious jerk
0,"USA has so much religios scam, make video about that not about some true stupid believer. Making fun of stupid honest well meaning people is so much worse then his idiotic speach. Stop this Karen bullshit clickbait, do something better with TYT then farming clicks. Religion in USA is such f...up (Abortion for example) leave simple people alone focus on the scam artists behind that make millions of this poor true believers. You deviding your country instead of putting things together."
2,Atheist explains a lot lol‚Ä¶dude has a point but it‚Äôs worthless to even  approach people with statements like that cuz at the end of the day people don‚Äôt give af what you
2,"Hey Ana... I'm a Christian,  but I still agree with you... F**k that ""male Karen"". I 'flip the bird' on occasion, and swear WAY TO OFTEN. He's a jackass."

2,"How does someone who has full sleeve tattoos have the balls to tell others that they cannot find worth in their body?  Especially when he wears a shirt that specifically shows off those tattoos.  Oh right, because the whole argument is bullshit.  Another attempt to remove body autonomy.  You can't show skin because I am not capable of teaching my children restraint.  Hope you enjoy your internet fame, and that your boss sees these videos."
2,Your kids are going to hate women now. Good parenting.

2,"I'd have told him that God created Adam and Eve naked and the beach provides us with an opportunity to get closer to our original state in Paradise. This guys previous job in his previous life was handing out fig leaf's in the Garden of Eden. I'd have called up a photo on my phone of Michaelangelo's Sistine Chapel frescoes as soon as he invoked the name of God. For devout Michaelangelo, the purest expression of divinity is found in the perfection of the naked human form. Unfortunately, the leaders of the Catholic Church were even more uptight about nudity than this guy: they commissioned other artists to paint clothes over the original figures nudity."
2,"When I was a kid some gigantically fat, gross woman told me I had to leave a public pool because I was upsetting young children because of my leg (I am an amputee). She even put her hands on me to physically force me to leave the pool area, at which point the life guards (and letter the police) got involved. 
     Never mind that I had every right to use the pool and had paid to be there.
     Also, I have been an amputee for 48 years now (since I was 3) and yea, little kids are sometimes scared, but mostly they are curious. If I can talk to them (always with parents permission) they stop being scared right away.
     When I worked at a resort I was swimming laps on my day off when I saw a little girl, about 4 with my fake leg trying to give it to her terrified looking dad.
    The kid was German and was trying to tell her dad, ""Daddy, someone for got their leg. You need to find them and give it back before they fall over.""
    Dad was thinking, ""Oh god, my kid has found someone's prosthetic leg and is playing with it. What should I say if the owner sees this?""
    Well his nightmare had come true. The owner had seen it, but thought it was hella funny.
    Though the child spoke only German, and I spoke only English the father, once he realized I was not upset was happy to translate.
     I was able to tell the child about my leg through her father. The kid was extremely sweet. After I explained about my leg and got her to put it back, she said something and patted my head (I was in the pool at this point) that caused her dad to laugh. She had said, ""You poor man. Not only is your leg gone, you can't even talk.""
     I have a huge amount of experience with children. It doesn't hurt them to see disabled people."
2,I spoke to fast...I WAS RIGHT ABOUT HIM and why he had a issue with these women. lol
0,Christians showing solidarity with the taliban like they've always done. They just hate that there are muslims coming here that aren't being as subjugating to women
2,So glad these girls were atheists. Smart
0,I thought the girls were really sweet in the way they handled being accosted like that.  Laughing and asking politely to be left alone. There were several guys in the background without shirts on.  These religious fools were just ridiculous.
2,"This happy clapper made a complete fool of himself, religion is like having a penis it‚Äôs all well and good to have one

2,"I do believe in God, but I don't believe in judging others. ""Let he who is without sin, cast the 1st stone."" That verse was to do with a prostitute. Because of her sins, a group of men were going to throw stones at her. Jesus basically said, if you haven't done ANYTHING wrong in your life, then you can cast a stone at her. But each one dropped their stone & walked away. I would like to see if other women down the beach, were dressed the same way as the girls, and if he reacted to same way to them."
1,he was not saying all for ivermectin   he was talking about his entire treatment  it got him better     TYT  spreads misinformation by saying Trump was working with putin for four years
1,The vaccine doesn‚Äôt work you can catch it and past it.. let this shit run its course.
1,"he never claimed that ivermectin is the ONLY thing that cured him......   the bottom line is, it wasn't the vaccine that cured him, obviously.......   TYT and CNN accusing someone from spreading misinformation is the MOUNT EVEREST of irony :D:D:D"
2,Segura in the interview tells joe that  he got the vaccine because his cousin who is infectious diseases expert admitted to him is the best choice then rogan does a stink face.
2,he would sue tyt but they have no money.
2,He was talking about suing CNN because they were saying he was taking the drug used on horse's not the one prescripted to humans.
2,"Dr Andrew Hill's post may have been referring to a ""study"" published by the Front Line Medical Care Alliance. Earlier this week, a judge prevented Dr Wagshul, the guy who runs that shit-show, from prescribing Ivermectin to a Covid patient."
2,Ana is triggered that Joe never invites her or any of the tyt clowns on his podcast. Big suprise nobody likes moronic SJWs
2,"He's making a questionable cause lagical fallacy, he is using correlation and implying causation, when some people don't even get symptoms from the virus that's some fairly sloppy thinking."
1,"Please don‚Äôt wear masks, please don‚Äôt take the vaccination, please take animal medicine and anything else you want. THANOS."
0,Ivermectin is perfect for Republicans. It is an anti-parasitic.
2,Joe Organ sure took a lot of drugs for a disease that ‚Äúisn‚Äôt that harmful‚Äù
0,"I think it would be helpful if we had a list of drugs that are actually being used by medical professionals to treat covid-19 patients and drugs that charlatans are pushing as treatments for covid-19. Education on this is important, otherwise grifters will continue to grift those who are gullible"
0,"To answer why people will pay for medicine that isn't proven to work instead of taking the vaccine for free is because there is a saying.  ""A fool and their money will soon part"""
1,I'm unsubscribing from tyt due to finally seeing that they will spew left wing talking points blinding .. do your own research about ivermectin.. just to add I'm all for democratic progression
2,I used being vaccinated. That and garlic. Hmm... it looks like I am fine without Ivermectin. Joe Rogan is just some punk who got lucky and survived. Wait until next strain. We will see if he survives that round.
1,Ana is better then Joe. Much better. Joe is garbage.
2,why don't everybody have access to monoclonal antibodies? What's the reason? Are there people who are more important than others?
2,Joe Rogan living proof that comedians are not philosophers and you don't have to be smart to be funny
2,I have watched this pandemic since in began and doctors have said how it tricks people because they naturally get better for a couple of days and then they go down hill fast.......Has Rogan been 'well' for sometime now or only a couple of days?
2,"Please Ana, by all means go talk to him on his show line Cenk did. Engage in a healthy disagreement that may educate how both sides think about it. You debated Tomi Lahren. Why not just be a guest? Not a bad idea for some attention to both points of view."
2,"I listened to a couple episodes of Joe Rogan's podcast a couple months ago while at work. Wanted to see what all the hype around this guy was. I really only knew him from the sitcom ""Newsradio"" and ""Fear Factor"", time killers on NBC back in the day. So I listened, and his interviews where serviceable, and he had no great insight into anything with his commentary. Like most of his show was pleasant enough background, but the level his listeners think he's so smart and the $100 million dollar is baffling. Like he wasn't even a good entertainer really. Like Rush Limbaugh was a horrible man, but his show could be entertaining, and he was a brilliant broadcaster, if not a great commentator who would often say horrific things. However he could stretch nothing into hours of content. Rogan doesn't even have that going for him. So, basically, I don't get this guy at all. However, on a larger scale, he has gotten dangerous and Spotify needs to pull his contract."
1,Joe is endlessly disappointing and really chosen to go down the path of the rightwing grifter in order to make even more money than he already has...
2,Was he vaccinated
2,"Either way he got better WITHOUT THE VACCINE !!!............And weren't they telling people that antibiotics just don't work at all in the beginning ??? So, there's no need in even thinking about taking'em.... They were suppressing and bad mouthing  just about everything(even vitamins ) last year that was Not a wearing a mask or waiting for vaccine ...."
2,You guys all thought that Joe would die and were rooting for it because it would fit your narrative of ‚Äúvaccines for everyone‚Äù. You were wrong. Vaccines are only for those with comorbidities. He got over this virus in ONE day with no vaccine. Lol.
2,Rogan is such an impressionable baby. At this point it seems malicious or it's because he is self-selecting the only doctors who agree with this Ivermectin BS. Data is out there. Read it or shut up
1,"Look up, ""EXPOSED! FDA, CDC WHO is hiding this from you."""
0,"Joe Rogan has got many deaths on his hands. What's he going to do now, sue for ""defamation""? :-)"
2,"His doctor advised him to take it you nimwats, crazy how TYT's content is aligned with CNN's, MSNBC etc, watch the video his doctor advised him, it helped him. he never told people to take it"
2,"I think the other point is, he is constantly claiming that people like him with no comorbidities  and are healthy are fine. 

So why does he need intervention?  It‚Äôs just a cold isn‚Äôt it? 

He accidentally shown that deep, deep down, he doesn‚Äôt believe it."
2,"I mean people can try to use  Ivermectin for covid. And if it doesn't work, they can curse joe rogan on their deathbed lol"
2,Guess ana and cenk won't be on his show anytime soon
2,"Z pac, the antibiotic, will do absolutely nothing against a virus. 
REAL doctor‚Äôs are actually strongly against prescribing antibiotics for anything other than a bacterial infection, because it can cause antibiotic resistance when used when it‚Äôs not needed. 
Yeah, way to go Joe, treat a viral infection with an antibiotic. 
Idiot. üòµ‚Äçüí´"
1,tYt is the most stupid online political content creator rip tyt
0,If there is a virus in the future that is a 100% death rate we are screwed even with a vaccine because people will still be stupid.
1,"Simple !!!! They don't trust the government or TYT, CNN & all the usual propaganda suspects. Maybe because they have all lied about so much all ready !!!"
2,"I have been calling out Kulinski and Talking Points for not calling out ""their boy"". I just saw Saagar back the fool up! ""F**k MSM!""? If they won't call Rogan out, who will?! ""Duh, Duh, it was a duh"". I used to give Kulinski some creditability but the ""synergy"" between him and Talking 'Pints' idiocy has me wondering."
2,"The real problem with Ivermectin is that it only cost about 2 cents a pill‚Ä¶
along with vitamin D (study after study has shown the lower your vitamin D status the harder this virus hits you) there is simply no money to be made.
Shame on you TYT for not doing your job as journalists and buying into the world of big pharma
the WHO says Ivermectin is one of the safest drugs on the planet and could easily be given out to people waiting for a vaccine‚Ä¶the problem is tho if you give people cheap drugs and they get the virus and don't get that sick, they might feel like they don‚Äôt need the vaccine‚Ä¶only money to lose if you promote something cheap, even if it ‚Äúhelps‚Äù
You say that there are no studies‚Ä¶let me ask you this, if you were sick how ethical would it be to withhold a medication that might save your life? Would you participate in such a study?

"
2,"WHERE WILL YOU GO WHEN YOU DIE? 

What day will it happen? Today? Tomorrow? 

One hundred and fifty thousand people die every day. How many of them were ready?

When you stand before God on that day will you go to heaven or hell? 

Jesus Christ tells us that unless you‚Äôre born again you will not see the kingdom of God. You will be judged for your sins; all of the lies, the immoral thoughts, stealing, blaspheming and justly sentenced to hell.

But you don‚Äôt have to go to hell. Jesus Christ tells us that whosoever repents of their sins and trusts in him can be saved. Jesus paid the penalty of your sins on the cross at Calvary two thousands years ago. 

What sin is worth an eternity in hell? Think how precious your eyes are to you, what would it take to sell your eyes? And how much for valuable the soul that looks out of those eyes? Don‚Äôt go to hell, repent and trust in Jesus and be saved."
2,"Z-pac is some dangerous s***! Doctors don't clue you in on this, wipes out your body's microbiome, causes liver damage, way too strong of an antibiotic!"
0,"I called this. I knew Rogan would fail to mention that he also received Regeneron's monoclonal antibodies treatment which is between $1200 and $1500 per shot, Z-pack antibiotics, a vitamin drip, and still hasn't answered whether he's gotten vaccinated. Seems Mr anti-media propaganda, is himself a propagandist. F**k Joe Rogan."
2,Why do people not listen to scientists and consensus? Does Joe even bring reputable doctors on his show anymore?
0,"Know what‚Äôs super ironic? The same people who refuse the vaccine because they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in it or understand how it works are scared of the side effects are the same people who gladly seek out and take ivermectin without any clue how it works, what is in it, or what the side effects and possible risks are ü§£ AND they‚Äôll cite the study that has since been retracted due to medical fraud as the holy grail of reasons to take ivermectin, yet purposely ignore alllllllll the actual legitimate data proving the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Takes a special kind of stupid. And the sad (and scary!) part is our world is full of em‚Ä¶"
0,"Have we been watching the same Joe Rogan? I have no idea how anyone could have ever thought that he had more than perhaps an eighth of a brain. He has never asked an intelligent question on his show. He just asks his stupid questions in an engaging way, and makes it painfully obvious that he doesn't understand why his controversial guests are controversial. Then his smart guests are just good at taking his stupid questions and giving interesting responses, anyway. He has ALWAYS been the Donald Trump of interviews. He just leverages his confidence and name recognition to convince unknowledgeable people that he is competent and get them to follow him through a kind of unfounded hero worship."
2,"For all of you who wished a person like Rogan and Trump a speedy recovery, I sure hope you‚Äôre all happy. üòêü§®"
2,"I don‚Äôt know ,  should I believe Anna or doctor Pierre Kory (a well known critical care physician ) who with his team treated  hundreds or even thousands covid patients using ivermectin and other medications ."
2,Joe Rogan is a moron. It‚Äôs scary how many followers he has when the guy can barely have a coherent thought. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2,"It's not intelligence thats in play here. First, JR has always been into anti gov conspiracy, and second It's about the attention grabbing. He has became another ""professional idiot"" making whatever statements that will bring in the $. His show should come with disclaimer."
2,Joe Rogan suppose expert saw a way to make money on covid so he decided to go that way and Rogan talk about big pharma reasons. He got lied to and he does not even know it.
2,Take care TYT !! Jo is suing CNN & only right. TYT next !!!
2,I'm sure it was the horse meds and not all the other shit he took that was actually proper meds for covid. lol
2,I would of been a little more on board with the ivermectin claim until he mentioned the doctor who prescribed it. I forget the name of the group the doctor is part of I think it's Frontline c19 doctors or some crap but the get major kick backs. Doctors can be bad people too.
2,If you listened to his podcast you might have heard him say he already had his medical treatment in place if he caught covid. That wasn't panicking. As for the vaccine it is not a cure all. Evidence now points to it offsetting the worst effects of covid but you will need a booster 6 months after your second vaccination given it is now proven that it's efficacy drops to 40% after that initial period
2,Lol why you piss off at him for his own opinion. His body his choice . Not like your beloved vaccine does anything to treat the virus. In fact the virus is not even deadly enough to spend this much effort to deal with.
0,"no worries, let him continue to spead the mis-information and more anti-maskers and anti-vaccine retards die, these retards are just wasting earth's resources, their deaths is the only good they will ever contribute to society."
2,I'm no fan of this abortion law. But this is concerning that parts of the country are officially deciding to effectively put sanctions on other parts of the US. I barely even like it when we sanction foreign countries ffs.
2,"I THINK THESE CONCERNED TEXAS CITIZENS SHOULD PAY FOR THE CARE & UPBRINGING OF SAID UNWANTED CHILDREN.
OH YA,THATS WHAT FOSTER CARE DOES.BUT THAT METHOD OF CARE DOES NOT SEEM TO CHURN OUT ANY REAL LAW ABIDING CITIZENS."
1,this just another left wing rubbish
2,Pretty sure Texans don‚Äôt care one iota about Portland or their politics...
2,Even though Texas ranks is the number ninth it slowly catching up to California because California is starting to feel the pinch of the pandemic since California lives off of borrowed money it's not really going to last long for the state which is why so many Californians left California for Texas. I don't like this reference but they called Texas the Western version of China in the US. I doubt the state would even notice Portland at all.
1,This is 100% political theatre.  Ted Wheeler is universally hated by progressives in Portland and he knows it.
2,I have been married in two states. Texas and Indiana. On both my marriage applications there is a question that ass are you at least second cousins? That is an actual question on the application. When I asked about it I was told it‚Äôs a old law that you have to be at least second cousins to be married in Texas. I seen the same question on my Indiana marriage license application.
2,"Lotta sad little trolls out these days, eh? Poor little guys. They have nothing of substance, especially a legitimate ideology, and resort to wasting their time trolling a left leaning podcast. I'd suggest maybe pick up a real hobby or start drinking or something."
1,"Wheeler is such a dork he should be a regular on the Young Turds. Portland City employees are being made to get vaccinated , but yet he still clings to ""my body my choice""! What about that little babies choice? Oh wait it can't vote."
2,"TYT wants to legalize heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine, but wants Vaccine mandates, wants to legalize abortion, and legalize transgenders using  women's bathrooms. Their medical IDEOLOGIES are all over the place."
1,I live in Portland and this is just performative. Today Wheeler said the police don't have to comply with city employees vaccine mandate after the police union threatened to quit. He's totally ineffective. People are trying to recall him.

What day will it happen? Today? Tomorrow? 

One hundred and fifty thousand people die every day. How many of them were ready?

When you stand before God on that day will you go to heaven or hell? 

Jesus Christ tells us that unless you‚Äôre born again you will not see the kingdom of God. You will be judged for your sins; all of the lies, the immoral thoughts, stealing, blaspheming and justly sentenced to hell.

But you don‚Äôt have to go to hell. Jesus Christ tells us that whosoever repents of their sins and trusts in him can be saved. Jesus paid the penalty of your sins on the cross at Calvary two thousands years ago. 

What sin is worth an eternity in hell? Think how precious your eyes are to you, what would it take to sell your eyes? And how much for valuable the soul that looks out of those eyes? Don‚Äôt go to hell, repent and trust in Jesus and be saved."

He never said slave owners DESERVE reparations. He said - as a matter of factual, observable reality - that any talk about reparations will inevitably lead to a conversation about giving reparations to slave owners. 
TYT is so shameful & simplistic. They'll vilify anything that makes them think outside of their banal framework"
0,Why the legislature in CA don't rewrite there laws to discourage frivolous recalls to circumvent an election is beyond me.

0,Every time when I see videos like this I am reminded of that Dave Chapell skit about a black-white supremacist and Kanye West's completely idiotic statement about slavery and I ask myself are these morons for real or are they doing this as a grift. Where ever their reasons are people like Larry Elder prove you don't have to be White to be a White Supremacist. You just have to agree with their fascist ideologies and policies if that means you'll rake in millions of dollars in serving and submitting to the White Elites and White Supremacists of this country who have systematically and purposefully oppressed people of color since the Spanish and the Puritans first landing on this continent.
2,Elder is right but the way he puts it is wrong. But stating that he says slave owners DESERVE reparation's is not what he said. Both sides are going way too far in battling each other when divided we fall.

2,SMH  If they lived back in that time they would have been the type of black people that helped find and sell other black people.
2,Did he do the reparations. Does telling a fact mean he condones it. Does white racists invented planned parenthood to thin out the freed black race mean Democrats still hate blacks who don't vote for them anymore.
2,Professor Tony Martin has done the most in depth research on who exactly dominated the slave trade.
2,"Slave owners deserve reparations?!!!. This man wants black people to support him? He will never be governor of California, not even the devil can help him."
2,He literally just said they got paid? No one would think he just made a point unless they wanted their racist ideology confirmed

I could see students doing most of their studies online and once or twice a week actually face-to-face with an instructor teacher that can go through their material with them do any explanations that I needed help them with any corrections that are needed it's a simple thing nobody has to make this such a big deal. All we have to do is vote America first and there's only one way to go for that and it's Donald Trump the man who wrote The Art of the deal nobody can do better than him he's the master of the deal and that's what our country needs a strong force but never got down that has a good view of the future and what it could be like one way or the other and I'm all for the one way Donald Trump.

   I never vote on them. 

   If you send out a poll to a group of ppl who approve of you, then the results are irrelevant. 
  That's what most if not all of these polls are always anyways. 
   A poll they sent out to ppl that they already know like them. 
   Or they only poll a select group of ppl. 
  A poll that they or ppl that support them paid for or conducted. Etc.

   It's hilarious. It means absolutely nothing. 
  Most ppl who are actually going to vote, don't waste their time with meaningless polls. 
   It shouldn't even be a topic of conversation."

1,I agree Donald Trump
1,intellect and common sense has nothing to do with color. Voting because of color as the number one reason for voting is stupid.Unless of course you are a corporate head and the person of color even though they can't lead as Kamala is no leader would vote for her if she took lobby money from their corporation in return for immense income returns. Thats a reason why they get bailed out instead of the small mom and pop stores.They can't buy prosperity or freedom like corporations do.
0,Tucker Carlson ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. did you formerly work for the National Enquirer? Your supposed commentary sure sounds like it.  Fox News aka Propaganda News
2,"You know... when I was a kid I thought clowns were pretty cool... but I grew up... why won't these people in the media? oh yeah... and a complete lack of objectivity... I forgot :)

On the subject of the star spangled banner... The United States should not be waving any other flag. Nothing is a bigger display of U.S strength and unity than a flag that represents you all, regardless of the hue of your epidermis, political ideology or religion... and given the current state of affairs, it would be advisable to at least appear united to onlookers... even if it's not currently true.

As someone who lives in an U.S allied nation, it doesn't do our confidence well to see demonstrations of our allies political strife being played out in the open for all to see... it may embolden some... and that will not end well for any of us :( Please... get it together and soon."
2,"This is the sad truth about our country but it seems as though it's a popularity  contest. We need to teach our kids to use their heads , look things up for themselves know what your talking about and don't get behinds someone just based on them being liked. Fact check them .

1,Kamala sucked her way into office. Period.
0,"It's a sad reality.  Most if not all of the world hate America.  That's before the Afgan retreat.  What is even sadder is most Americans think they are still some kind of world leader.  Apart from the fine military, the US has nothing legitimate to say to the rest of the world."
1,A Demi-god of the underworld‚Ä¶ more like THE JOKER‚Ä¶
1,She was given the job to safeguard Biden from impeachment.
1,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JUST IN TIME FOR HALLOWEEN....I GIVE YOU THE HARRIS. YEAHHHH. SHE NEVER FAILS TO UN-IMPRESS ME. SO UN-SMART. MUCH LIKE HER SIDE KICKASS BIDEN. WHAT A PAIR THEY ARE.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GOD BLESS US FROM THEM.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Demi-gurd?
1,"Kamala is even an even more radical anti-American than Biden, so I'm afraid if Biden does get impeached, will have just gone from the frying pan to the fire, and then there's Pelosi, so God help us all with this triangle of evil ruling our nation."
2,Kamala Disney is controlled by CCP as is most of Hollywood Where is US culture and ideal's gone or controlled by whom ? CCP & Disney CHANGE DNA & COULOUR at will Make believe is great on screen don't work well in real life
2,Obama chose her.

1,"Kunmala always been a bottom tier candidate. Ask former mayor Brown. That how she got into politics in the first place.
WWG1WGA"
2,"As a person of color, I don't appreciate this crap putting people in charge just because of color. Put people because of Competency. I'd rather put an alien from Mars there if they haven't gone extinct yet... Of course if they are competent"
1,"Dont forget;"" The First Idiot Vice president God put in the bible for A Man to be Pastor, NOT women women make decisions off their emotions not logic"
1,"She didn't ""win a seat at the table"", she had to drop out because nobody likes her, she was selected just like Biden was.."
1,It disgusts me to watch the US be ran by a criminal administration.  When will Americans get big enough balls to actually do something about it?? PRESIDENT TRUMP WON!
2,the news anchors have gone nuts.
2,"yes SENATOR would have been better for the people to stay representing California, but Biden needed help.  Anyway,  people are waking up to the President and Vice President."

1,"we don't care what f color she is , harris Biden got to go"
1,It‚Äôs not an accomplishment when you are hand picked solely based on  your race and gender. She is the ultimate example of virtue signalling.
1,Inpeach her she is so fake just like sleepy joe is they are America's major problem
2,Obama was just as unknown am unchecked an nobody cared

2,USA is finished.
2,"0. K. Let's admit it. George Dubya's war on terror has been an enormous waste of time, human suffering, and money. $3.000.000 a day for the last twenty years, according to some reports. Now, there are more homegrown terrorists in America than it's possible to shake a stick at. Think what Bin Laden would have felt if his supporters could have achieved the same as Trump's on 21."
2,"Isn't she?!
She's the first president of the United States that never runned to be president.

Or do you think that Biden rules anything?"
1,When we impeach biden we impeach his administration too. That means kakamala too.

2,Maybe she's a science experiment going bad in the refrigerator of the   White House. ü§®
2,Give her a gag and tell her to step down along with looney political partner in charge.  Both are a disgrace and embarrassment to this country. Neither one of them are capable of doing the most important job in this country... PROTECT AND SUPPORT the people that pay their salaries... WE THE PEOPLE.
1,"Sounds like they are turning Kamala Harris into Princess Diana. 

America has no thought what she will do. Because she is a pawn of the right color, but does not have the ability to think on her feet. 

If you asked me, all this time we‚Äôve been told that White people are systemically racist. On the contrary. White people really aren‚Äôt but the people of color will vote for someone who is there color despite that the one most of note was a RED DIAPER BABY!"
2,"As a Guatemalan, i assure you, the of a vice president is last thing ppl are focused on in a 3rd world country like Guatemala..that silly mindset doesn't exist there..survival is the mindset there...plus,Barack obama is the 1st black PRESIDENT..so a asian female VICE PRESIDENT isn't a game changer,..everyone wants to be the ""first"", everyone wants to be an icon..smh.."
1,"It is sad that the first ""woman vice president"" that is  OF COLOR, make sure to get THAT right btw, is this cackling hyena disgrace that's apart of an even more disgraceful administration that consistanly shows the absolute downgrade of our American government."
1,"I'd say it's a good time for Trump to demand the reins be handed back over to him since they were illegally & fraudulently withheld from him, for all this time anyway."
2,If I was a person of color I would be leery of a Vice President who's parents held people of color as slaves.
2,Feminism is absurd now? Lol ok
2,Poor poor people
2,"One difference between Trump and Harris, Harris would have you working for free in a prison, Trump would have you working for cash"

2,Super heroes are born not aborted.  Where is Kamala on this  issue?
1,Does AOC know...anything?
2,How many idiots does it take to elect her? Just amazing.
2,Parents making a bad choice to come here illegally
2,Go to the statue of liberty
2,AOC is a Box of Rocks!
2,Glad to see the USA also has RAGA (Rahul Gandhi) kind of people üòÇ
1,"They, the liberal left, have no problem whatsoever removing a baby from a mother‚Äôs womb, all be it a full term or not, but yet they do supposedly have a problem with removing a child from a mother entering the border illegally. How upside down is that?"
2,She wouldn't anything now since they are taking away unvaxxed children from their unvaxxed parents. It's all nefarious political agenda in the of side bad to plummet the country of it's sovereign glory ordained from God.
1,AOC is the only waitress that can‚Äôt bring something to the table.
2,"someone give the woman her old job back, please 
All she was good at was knocking on doors and making big  promises.
Let it be a lesson to all in politics.
Any ignoramus can get elected into office if he knocked enough doors and promised big enough."
2,What kind of ‚Äúfamily‚Äù separates themselves from their children??? I don‚Äôt understand this.  I know women here that have left their children behind in another country.  What mother does that? . I would NEVER leave my children behind
2,Seeking asylum? Go through a legal point of entry.
1,"AOC is a real credit to her worshippers, the American left üòÇ both have no sense"
1,"AO-C want 200,000 Afganistan in the US. Let's put them in her districts, we will have an American Afgan representatives from that district, win win.  People cross the border, with no means of supporting their children or commit crimes are separated from their kids all the time."
2,"Homan is a rock star! He didn't budge, calmly explaining facts to a mentally challenged girl is playing congress woman! LOL."
2,"If this clown managed to get elected then now i truly beleive ' nothing is impossible """
1,How embarrassing for you AOC!!!!!!!
1,AOC your actually a Marxist....an Atheist and out of your mind!! Do your homework and stop putting the kids in danger and let illegal immigration happen..... you have done nothing to make things better.....you are bought and paid for!!!!!! This isn't something YOU have discovered!!!!!!!!
2,Who voted for this child.
1,This started when AOC and the rest of her screwed up party started recruiting foreigners to migrate to our borders and instructed them to break our laws!
1,"Kinda funny. The crisis at the border is 10 times worse now than it was then. Has anyone heard AOC whining lately about ""kids in cages?"" Yeah, I thought not. Hypocrites!!!!"
1,"People talk a bout the dangers of White supremacy but I see in AOC, the danger of Dumb supremacy."
1,AOC need to be removed from her position because she doesn't know anything and all she knows is how to read from a piece of paper smh ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1,AOC the smartest dumb girl ever.
1,"Does she actually care about family separation and the family unit? Absolutely not. How can someone on the left support abortion and all the heinous school indoctrination (neither of which regard all human life as precious) and then make this argument? The Left is doing all they can to destroy the family unit and replace God with government. 
Pray for children and the future of our nation. 
-A Stay at Home Mom"
2,The children are with Coyote's not their Parents! Cartel's are making millions of dollars on these children it's a known fact!
2,How these people get elected is beyond me.  Why defend those that break the law???  üò°üò°
2,"I don't really like AOC, but damn, she is hot af üíØüî•"
2,How did she get here she has no idea what the laws are ? DA
1,"Its illegal so you can shoot them down right ?
They are illegal so you can seperate children from their parents....

There is something called proportionality in law and AOC is right... Most people are just racist and have no clue what they are talking about...."
1,"AOC lying again!
She is the most dishonest politician in Washington!"
1,"When AOC speaks, she can make a tree stump look like a genius."
2,"Pretty sad that we've got a child in Congress, I don't think she would remember to breathe if her brain didn't tell her to"
1,AOC is a child that needs to grow up. She‚Äôs all feelings.
2,I'm guessing there's not a great deal of familiarity with the Geneva Convention among commenters here.
2,So why then isn't it a crime when Joe Biden allows them to enter American territory by close to a million people by now?????
2,and people actually vote for that idiot?
2,"She has no idea how the system works. Seeking legal asylum still means you have to have permission to enter the country, otherwise you ILLEGALLY entered."
2,She makes us Puerto Ricans look bad! This woman has no place in politics but maybe a talk show with Oprah. üòï
1,"What a joke! Boy she tried to twist the narrative but he answered her with TRUTH and up holding the USAs laws upon entry into this country. You know something. Maybe some one has answer. Why do they (you know who ‚Äúthey‚Äù are) want to  become an American citizen, but WANT TO CHANGE EVERYTHING OUR COUNTRY STANDS FOR? God, family, country! 
Lee, Grant, Calhoun, Stonewall Jackson, the men still today in the Marines, Army, Air Force, Navy... who fought (fighting) to KEEP OUR FREEDOMS. 
Get your Bibles
Get your guns
Get ready..."
1,AOC wants to be Fidel Castro so bad

1,Arrest the illegals period
1,"Humm let‚Äôs think , illegal boarder crossing , it in the name it‚Äôs a crime  ‚Äú illegal ‚Äú. She claims to of gone to college , that seems questionable !"
2,"Why vote for this complete idiot and liar. They really like harming our country for their personal benefit. So disgusting, should be illegal."
2,AOC was about to cry LOL
2,Dump all those and divert all those illegal entry people to her home. She will be set üòú once for all. Crazy lady.
1,Getting older is a given. Growing up is optional. Some people are happy to be juvenile all their life and AOC is a prime example.
2,these sort of hearing should be conducted here in India. let the people know who is the fool.
2,My daughter was took by the department of Job and family Services because I grew up in the system I had no drug habits or anything so if you want to fight for immigrants to keep their children but what about the Americans that lost our  children to the department of Job and family Services system
2,"This woman looks arrogant, not having any understanding of law and looks like she is not suitable for any government post either secretary of a department or as a government employee."
2,Wow AOC actually did some research for once but then she conveniently assumed 'illegally' also meant legally which is not what the document says.
1,A.O.C Talieb and Omar Should Be Locked Up In Prison For Treason Against The American People and Humanity
1,Does AOC   '' WAKE  UP ''  Or Not After This Hearing Or Is She Basically  '' LOST '' !!!!!
1,"AOC is a huge hypocrite because she advocates by her actions what she seeks to deny in her rhetoric. Like everything on the left, she lies very well about what she is actually doing."
2,This is a woman who graduated with honors in Economics and INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS!! Boston University has a lot to answer for.
2,"The mainstream media is SILENT.

1,"It upsets me that people see Fauci as the big savior, and he was the instigator and supervisor of the production of this virus."
2,The same with Climate Change.
1,The American public will pay the price for allowing this senile puppet and his masters to destroy the christian fabric of this nation. Destruction is coming America!
1,When injustice is law resistance is duty. Thomas Jefferson.  It's time to vote them out and stop this communist takeover that world leaders want to control.
1,"Fauci knows nothing, he's being controlled by demons, the W, H, O, Bill Gates,and the New World Order, he knows the vaccine is spreading the virus and killing people."

2,And how many die from the flu ?
1,"Exactly what I thought and knew and heard about a long time ago. 90% of any death has the hash tag, ""death by Covid"", even if the reason is ridiculous"
2,Look up tuberculosis deaths! We don‚Äôt quarantine for that????? This was a control test!!!
2,Funny no one got the flu in 2020
2,This was all pre-planned by the left
2,In my mind you cant support western medicine in general and not support the covid narrative. They are one in the same. Science projects. Intended fpr a particular result. The result not being what the recipient thinks it will be.
1,Frankenstein fauci facilitates appocolytic viruses! coverup specialists! Resulting in mail in ballots results Venezuela style election! landslide at midnight! Come on man!
1,I've been saying the same thing I was telling everyone I know that the doctors I use to work with were pressured to put down covid when it started regardless of what the person death was. Also we got word after the election when patato head cheated some of the employees at the hospital said they weren't gonna do no more screening.
1,"The President, (""our President of the United States""), has just not only saved the United States Citizens, ""(our family members)"";' but He, has saved the World also with this vaccine.. We the People,  and the World;  ( ""THANK YOU"",; President TRUMP ),."

1,"I will never take that poison and I will die fighting it this is a government conspiracy to weed out the population, let them give it to the black and brown illegal communities first"
1,"If you die by falling off a ladder, they will say you've died from covid !"
1,"We know the hospitals were making money for the reported covid diagnosis. The government paid hospitals: $13k per day every patient, for every ventilator used $48k, for every 120 patients reported to have covid $$78 k..  Hospitals wanted deaths reported as covid causes, although few were actually for covid, because it was a money maker!!!"
1,Scam by democrats! They all belong in jail!
1,"Plandemick! Dems, china and fauci  did this to pull off there coup!"
1,Dr Fauchi was deeply involved in the creation of this virus together with Bill Gates
2,Mail-in ballots proved to be the cure
1,COVID-19 numbers are just as inflated as Biden‚Äôs alleged votes
1,"Within 2 years, the Vaccinations will kill more people, than the virus. SM-102 ‚ò†"

This is to keep the numbers up and Validate the need for Vax.
Like N. Korea, ""You can lead a Country with Fear."""

2,I was told by healthcare workers ) friends ) who are never heard.5-23-21 and just hearing this now.
2,The reaaon the Doctors are being pressured to increase the numbers is because hospitals get paid more for Covid deaths.
,I don't believe in the vaccine
1,"Stop listening Mark Levin since began pushing the vaccine as American ingenuity, and Trump succeeds without knowing o maybe he did that was experimental and that long collateral damage is no known. 
Also big guns like him, Beck, Savage,Hannity, are betting on take the house back .its a mistake, our Federal government is broke.the Fight is in the STATES LEGISLATURES. The only guy who understands that is DANIEL HOROWITZ. Who is organizing Patriots volunteers in each red state to push Republican politicians 
To follow the constitution.  Unfortunately none of the talk radio is promoting his agenda. Shame on them"

2,"....the Dems Moaned, complained, Fought NOT to have Legally Correct Actions to recount Disputed Election Ballots!  Think they‚Äôre going to go to Investigate False Death certificates?!  No matter WHAT evidence was uncovered?"
1,What I am witnessing everyday is extremely bothering. Folks having so much fear won't even take off a mask while outside although the CDC indicated those vaccinated can. Once we lose faith in the air we breathe we are deeply at a lost . Never chose to wear a mask outside since mask wearing became prevalent nor have any interest in taking a vaccination. Are we forgetting the power of our own immunity system. I cherish the sciences as well as a healthy lifestyle. The immunity systems will fight off anything if we took care of ourselves accordingly. Stop allowing your system to turn into a garbage disposal. Take time to do some form of exercise.
2,100+in agreement. Trump was making efforts to have Fauci dismiss
2,the numbers are being pumped up by liars period Levin get it right it's not bad data gathering it's pure lies.
2,"The US government r playing politic & habe hidden agenda. This has been ingrain √¨nto  the government system So no matter which party is in control, it will just cruse along. It will eventually destroy US & western along with iy one day. God have mercy on u lot"
2,"Could not agree anymore with what is mentioned in this video.  We need to trust the science, but why? If we trusted the science, why are CDC recommendations changing month-to-month? We trust the science one month then have to start trusting it in another direction.  
When something doesn't seem right or make sense, typically isn't!"
1,It's all in the leftist socialist agenda.
2,"Well now, a year later and Mr Fauci is still blithering on and on with his ever changing story.  Dr Ericson and his group have all been stifled ... what more do you need to now. Senator Dr Rand Paul gave Fauci a grilling over NIH funding p4 lab gain of function research. He tried to deny it but Senator Paul had him by the short hairs"
2,"I remember if anyone who smoked died of lung cancer, they would automatically say it was the smoking, iven if the cancer was caused by something else or metastasized from another organ. They wouldn't even look to see."

2,Hello I'm not quite sure that went through notice having a little bit of trouble okay if we have more of the epidemic coming around why are we letting people across the border with all kinds of diseases do they really care or they want to keep it going and going and going we should be closed down get everything under control we don't ask them to check and see if they even have it what are we doing well I don't think the American people are crazy I'm wondering about the government I've never seen a government like this and I've lived a long time well oh where are the children need to know where the children I have a fear that they're lost to us forever is that true where are the children are they safe who are they with where are they going we as Americans have a right to know we love children we love America
2,If they're so worried about Corona why are they letting of all these people cross the border that have it we just had some more come over from where they have really bad outbreaks I don't remember which country it is but it wasn't any of the countries we dealt with now these are people that really need help I understand that but why are we letting more come over with different viruses to give us this is ridiculous if I do and Biden we're so worried about it they would not let anyone come over they would keep us shut down till we got it under control again but they keep letting them come over and over and over they don't test them they don't give them shots so what is going on here are we all that stupid or maybe they could explain to us what they're doing protect the American people thank you very much
1,Good for you. They are trying to push the  vaccine. We need to all stand up and say enough  NO
1,"Why is that indeed ! Its never been about a virus...its about the great reset....why do all these talking heads refuse to acknowledge that ,I wonder...Not bad data collection its treason  The great reset.Soros Gates IMF , W E F , etc...why do they hide that fact ???"

1,Dont believe the fake media. Covid is not anything they say it is .its all about them trying to get there bioweapon jab that is only meant to take you out
2,Thank you Mark Levin for all you do.
2,"yes, and who is the one that brought him into the WH? PENCE! PENCE IS ANTI TRUMP, WORKING AGAINST HIM AND HE AND RYAN HAD A COUP TO GET RID OF TRUMP FROM THE GET GO!"

1,Thjank you President Trump and the TEAM for exposing fraud waste and abuse in the medical Industrial Complex. Credibility of Medical Doctors and the like is being questioned. Thats a good thing.
2,I'm disgusted how stupid our governed are.
2,I have so much respect for all that have the courage to speak out and share this info. Those that don‚Äôt believe in GOD and Satan should research the info on this video.
2,That's what the government continues want us to be controled by the government. That's not science. That's more than fiction and not fact.

1,"I don't know where Sarah Palin went to school, but she is clearly a bonafide genius. This woman's intellect is off the charts. Her intuition is unparalleled and her wisdom is a joy. Her boobs look great too, for a woman her age."
2,"On 6 Jan 2021 the Congress was discussing the possibility of an illegal election. Before the 1st protested state, Arizona, had the full evidence of the irregularities exposed... a fully orchestrated, illegal, domestic terrorist backed riot took place in the Capitol. The intent of the ""deep state"" was realized when the riot stopped the legitimate debate on the issue at hand. Congress was evacuated and the debate stopped. The Capitol was cleared of rioters, and later that evening, Congress returned and, as expected, the fire for finding the problem had burned out, as the ""deep state"" planned it. There are videos of Capitol Police waving the protestors onto the Capitol lawn and into the building. According to some, facial recognition software has identified ""Antifa"" members in the rioting crowd. As they did in the summer riots, normally peaceful people were antagonized by the anti fascists and followed along. The end result was attained... justifying the means. Debate stopped and Biden was certified by unchallenged slates of electoral votes. The Georgia challenge and the few challenges that came afterward received overwhelming votes against and the electoral protest procedure was halted in tis tracks. Not unexpectedly, there were soon calls from the left for V.P. Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the POTUS... and if he doesn't agree, we will start impeachment proceedings. The ""deep state"" has tried for 4 years to remove Donald J. Trump from office an they will not stop... even 12 days before the end of his term. ""He is dangerous!"", they say. ""He incited a riot!"", they say. The truth is, that with the intelligence that he still has access to... he is a threat to their illegal livelihood and has been for 4 years. It scares them to death that their truths may be revealed. For the left and the deep state, it is truly a matter of life and death to remove Trump. As Hillary Clinton said, (paraphrased), ""If that S.O.B. gets elected, we'll all hang by nooses."" Truer words were never spoken. Donald Trump was not as vindictive as he should have been, and he allowed them to slide. BIG MISTAKE!!!! A majority of the left and a goodly portion of the right are involved in enriching themselves from activities that are surely less than above board in the USA. They all fear the consequences. Some would surely face death for their crimes. We can only pray that justice will be served."
1,"Patriots and True conservatives, dump all the technology company stocks who have banned Trump and Conservatives. You are the one making them rich and cut their branches one by one.  Also do not support any company, person or media who is against freedom of expression."
2,Palin is not someone I! would want to be associated with. Those who actually educate themselves about these things compare her to Palosi or Feinstein. She's a mental case nut job with to much power.

I think those who own guns are the ones who shouldn't.

0,Nobody needs an AR15 to defend themselves.  There is no need to have a weapon which can hold upto 25 rounds of ammunition and fire off that ammunition ina automatic mode.  All pushing to have households to be allowed to have weapons means that households are going to absolutely need them.  The only beneficiaries to this are the ultra wealthy who can have their own armed guards and the weapons companies.  The rest of the country suffers.

Senator Boxer former california ‚Äúrepresenting‚Äù California called for all gun owners to voluntarily turn in weapons.  She made a BIG deal in media coverage of putting her guns into pile.  ... later it was discovered she kept UNREGISTERED guns at home. This man was brainwashed.  So defund police is next step in his future or stand up to defend his American rights under constitution. Which will it be?  He has right to abdicate but should respect everybody else‚Äôs right to protect themselves OR head off to China for more intense indoctrination and loss of all his finances under great reset - China leads world in use of social media to control everyone.  First rule down that path is disarm population. Communists ALWAYS do that. So do dictators.

2,"This was an official, on the record, approved by NATO deal to get rid of a corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine! Viktor Shokin refused to press corruption charges against the previous administration, TWO YEARS before Hunter Biden was offered the job at Burisma. He may not have been experienced, but he is well educated, and I would very much like someone to show me a pay stub, because I am curious about how much they paid to regain respectability. 

That‚Äôs what they thought they were getting, after the Ukrainian Revolution, and the removal of the previous corrupt government and the former owner of Burisma. The Ukrainians are desperately fighting for their independence from Russia and its influence. They mistakenly thought it would look good to hire the USVP‚Äôs son. That‚Äôs all there is to that."
2,It is a shame what they are purposely doing to this great nation we don't deserve any of this  WE HAVE TO STOP THE GREED AT THE TOP SO OUR COUNTRY CAN HEAL WE ARE THE BEST

1,"Biden administration failed all categories of the US Constitution and Declaration of Independence.

1,"There are some Americans who understand war very well! They are known as the Industrial military complex, with great support from the democratic party, aka the new Communist party of America. Once we get out of Afghanistan they will give it a LITTLE time to blow over. And then they will find another 20-year war to continue that money flow!!!"
2,"Chris is a sucker for the Globalist Elites who start these stupid wars, and he needs to think a bit more deeply instead of being naive and gullible.
Just ask yourself a simple question:  Do the super rich Globalist Elites ever send their children or grand children to fight their stupid wars?
Our very own Henry Ford built trucks for the German Wermacht during WW2 in Cologne and while the whole of Cologne was littered bombed flat to the ground by the Allies, miraculously the Ford factory in Cologne remained undamaged.
Wake up."

2,"Virtually everyone serving in the military doesnt understand it either, particularly kids with virtually no life experience."
2,"Chris Kyle, like Stephen Glass, was a serial fabulist who told fabricated story after fabricated story. Mr. Kyle‚Äôs medal count claim was contradicted by the United States Department of Navy. His ‚ÄúHurricane Katrina Sniper Story‚Äù was contradicted by both Army Lieutenant General Russell Honore and the United States Special Operations Command.

Mr. Kyle‚Äôs ‚ÄúPunching Jesse Ventura Story‚Äù was contradicted by the Coronado Police, while his ‚ÄúTexas Car Jacking Story‚Äù was contradicted by both the Johnson County Sheriff and the Johnson County District Attorney.

Considering the trove of fabricated stories told by Chris Kyle that have been discredited by both military and law enforcement personnel, it is highly likely that many of the stories contained in Mr. Kyle‚Äôs book also have been fabricated, either partially or totally."
2,"this guy was full of himself 
do the job you signed up for and dont expect the tax payer to pat you on the back all the god damned time 
I heard he made up stuff in his book too although the constant ""thank us for our service"" is the more obnoxious"

2,He a con artist him and his wife profiting from lies over lies
2,If you.know someone that fought in Vietnam or Korea or www and they talked to you you know war. My daddy talked about crawling. Over dead bodies that were rotting. My friends in Korean war. About being shot at. My friends in Vietnam had nightmares of dropping bombs knowing that they are also killing Children . All of the above goes for.modern war. God bless them all. Pray fir them abs be their friend.
2,"Anyone disliking this interview should be sent for a week of basic training. Men and women in the military should be held far higher in regard than any movie star,musician and most certainly,politicians. Thank you to all who have served,past ,present and who will in the future!"
2,"....of course,... they are grappling to understand the logic..when there is no one attacking USA...to understand the reason why US is fighting so many wars all over the world..scondaring trillions of $...sacrificing many young American lives....crazy situation..and to understand why the largest country on  this planet Russia is not fighting any...crazy.."

2,If he was alive he‚Äôd be a powerhouse politician
2,"Most Americans understand war, they just don't understand people who always want war."
2,"This popped up in my recommendation out of nowhere and all I can say is, give us a few more months maybe sooner and America will be in a civil war."
2,They don't know war never had anything bad happen.spoiled brats that don't get thier way
2,"Most American's realize that Wars are Created for Profit and Control... 
and for a Government to Use its people to Fight and Die in a Foreign Land for Nothing more than Profit and Control... well, Not Good.
It is Governments that spread False Claims to enter into ie

2,I still feel that Obama had something to do with this....
2,Most soldiers don‚Äôt understand war either.

2,"don't worry americans, now pregnant women will protect you."
2,The man who made a living and  bragged about murdering hundreds of people which was never verified. No one in military should ever brag about murder. liar
2,I don't believe it's possible to understand war without training and serving to save your life and other's lives. On top of that there are lessons only historical studies can teach us and that takes years. People are too innocent to understand war and I think that's a good thing but there's a lot of work left to do here and abroad and ignorance is no excuse.
2,Agreed most Americans don‚Äôt understand war. They just want to enjoy their lifestyle and let others do the dirty work

I watched and thought it was an excellent movie that gave many of us just a little hint of what he and ALL the others who served over there had to deal with...
The hardest part for me,  was the tail end when suddenly you hear what starts out like TAPS ,  then flows into the beautiful closing theme,  Along with  the LONG FUNERAL procession  coming down the Interstate with all the LIGHTS  &  FLAG bearing Bikes driving down through the Hundreds of people lined up alongside the highway  & the bridges in the rain to pay their respects to a true Americanüá∫üá∏Hero ;  And I was in tears,  and then the picture of COWBOY  STADIUM where HUNDREDS were gathered to say goodbye...

2,"This guy was a lying hack and fraud.  He wants to claim that war is horrific but look at what he's wearing, Punisher symbols.  He was right about Americans not understanding war but he's a hypocrite lying about it and glorifying it.   He also made up a lie about Jesse Ventura saying that he was smearing veterans so he beat up Ventura.  Absolute fiction."
2,Redskin name show just show the brainwashing people get when they keep doing racism.
2,As a native american i am offended that you change the redskins name and not the cowboys why do white people still get a team and we dont
2,"I'm white. I've been white all my life. I have Indian friends. I've asked them are you offended by being called an Indian. Each time I was told know because they grew up with the word. Do I ask them are they offended by the grade school BIG Chief Writing tablet. They said know. 

If I had to be identified politically, I'm left, and I'm really tired of white people panic with all the PC titles. 

No one I know has ever asked the person they felt should be offended IF they are offended. They just assume. It makes me nuts."
2,The VERY few people that actually support this are not interested in what actual Native Americans have to say. It has nothing to do with not causing offense; it is 100% about control.
2,"the indians had a face in nfl, not anymore"
1,"The only people who want the name change are arrogant, stupid, no common sense, s**t for brains liberals in this country."
1,"They should change the name to "" The Washington Mexicans "".  That would make all Mexicans proud that they can finally  cross the border illegally with the blessings of ""Hyena"" Harris and the dummycRATs in Washington and be part of the American dream."
1,Whenever there‚Äôs a race issue 95% of the people offended are white liberals and a good 5 % are the group actually offended therefore liberals are snowflakes
1,Woke left destroying America ‚Ä¶ losers
2,"Just be the Washington Crooks, you already have a bunch of mascots at the capital."
2,Native American's not from here. Stop playing them people from Northern Russia. Not America. They are Siberian. The definition of Redskin= North American Indian. That's a mixed Mexican on this interview üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
2,Would you walk up to a Native- American and call him or her a redskin?
2,Why don‚Äôt the NY Jets change their name? Doesn‚Äôt their name partially reference one of the biggest terrorist attacks on AMERICA? While we‚Äôre at it let‚Äôs give the right to have a say about it to every single person who wasn‚Äôt affected by it!
1,"Actually, the offended cancel culture babies have taken something away from the Native American by denying them tributes to their ancestry. Those titles of teams as respectful and honorable. It is a shame the Indian nation did not see it that way and come in defense of the team and themselves.  This isn't the first time this has happened. The cancel culture couldn't care less if the native American dropped out of sight into obscurity and eventual extinction.  
Shame on the native Americans for not speaking out in defense of themselves."
2,"Redskins is racism towards native Americans apparently. 
Imagine if a team was named ‚ÄúBlack skins‚Äù people would be offended and call it racism towards black people. 
If a team was called White skins people would say it‚Äôs white supremacy. Funny how that works"
1,Democrats are the biggest racist on Earth an Indian should be ashamed of themselves for following the slave drive and Democrat that are truly racist and killed them off

2,"God Bless Mark OneWolf Yancey for supporting the Redskins Name! Question for most of these SJW's who are not even Native American Indians: How does changing Athletic Team names actually help the plight of Americans who live on Reservations?
    Will name changing help Organizations like Native American Guardian's Associations help their cause? 
    Plan Parenthood and the Hindering Government programs have done great harm to Native American Indians than name changes ever could!"
2,nam--> vietnam- dumb as- gookologists!
2,How about they change the name to the caucasiens. Then we‚Äôll see how ‚Äúracist‚Äù it truly is.
2,It‚Äôs obviously cultural pride..... who names their own cities team after an insult?? It‚Äôs American history. We fought the natives for hundreds of years. The reason we name it the Jeep Cherokee is because it‚Äôs viewed as badass..... not insulting.
0,Removal of the Awesome Native American logo was EXTREMELY DISCRIMINATORY!
2,I totally agree when I take the shirt off my white brows and women oh you are so white never got a tan however 10 hrs in sun I am a real redskin then I was rushed to hospital for burns I would love to have red skin and beautiful black k hair
0,Breaking news: Native Americans are able to have varying opinions. I too am a Native American and I am against Native mascots in areas where Natives are a minority. I shockingly have the audacity not to speak for other people so yes there are Natives who aren't offended and yes there are Natives who are against Native mascots. I don't know who needs to hear this but Native people don't get together and decide a collective opinion and then the rest of us have to follow it.
2,"The Redskins can avoid the racist charge by changing their mascot to a Redskin Potato! :-)

Many teams have aggressive names: the Bears, the Bengals (tigers), the Eagles, etc.  In a similar vein, the name Redskin was chosen because American Indians were viewed as tough warriors.  It was really intended as a compliment.

The people claiming that Redskins is a racist term have not been able to find a single documented instance of the term Redskins being used in a derogatory manner since the 1920s.  It's doubtful there is single person alive who has heard the term Redskins used as a racial slur.  The meanings of a word sometimes changes and the word Redskins is one such word.  Redskin hasn't been a slur in at least a century."
1,See they don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs just white liberals taking away heritage
2,Isn't it racist to change the name and logo? Change the color red also
2,Gary Clark of the Washington Redskins conducted at least 3 football camps at Native American reservations during his career. He wanted to know if they thought the Redskins name was racist. What he saw was Native Americans wearing Redskins gear and saying that they were proud to be a Redskin fan and the 5% that weren‚Äôt Redskins fans were Cowboys fans and that‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt like the name.
1,The minority wants to cancel everything
0,The name and logo never offended me. It was always the fans wearing headdresses and regalia they‚Äôd call ‚Äúcostumes‚Äù that‚Äôs the racist part people don‚Äôt understand
1,"Chief Operating Officers, Chief Chefs, Chief Surgeons, Fire Chiefs .....where does it freaking stop lib tards?

Past.  White man takes land"
0,"Present.   Leftists forces our opinions"""
2,It‚Äôs funny how white people decide what‚Äôs racist for other races.
1,Wouldn't the Vikings be racist too??? LOL
1,Yes I totally agree change the name and let‚Äôs stop promoting Native Americans as warriors let‚Äôs stop promoting these people as successful I think we should totally change the name and I think we should totally stop using well these people who are here first who are successful at building well piles of dirt as successful and admirable societies
1,is there anything people are not offended by today?

1,"Nothing will be done as usual. The Clintons have the powers bribed to keep them out of jail.
