There is still a problem with landlords justifying evictions and against the law causing people to move out within a day's notice and having their security deposits stolen. Landlords can continue to make security deposits over false notions and make people's lives worse. The houses are not necessarily being torn down. They're just converted. It would be nice if a studio apartment didn't cost more than you make at a minimum wage job that you have to walk to because you still can't afford a vehicle. Craziness.

And as anyone who's watched Fox knows, its fundamental message is rage at what liberals are doing to our country. Over the years the specific message has changed with the times ‚Äî from terrorism to open borders to Benghazi to Christian cake bakers to critical race theory ‚Äî but it's always about what liberal politicians are doing to cripple America, usually with a large dose of thinly veiled racism to give it emotional heft...

The Fox pipeline is pretty simple. Fox News stokes a constant sense of outrage among its base of viewers, largely by highlighting narratives of white resentment and threats to Christianity. This in turn forces Republican politicians to follow suit. It's a positive feedback loop that has no obvious braking system, and it's already radicalized the conservative base so much that most Republicans literally believe that elections are being stolen and democracy is all but dead if they don't take extreme action."" - Unknown"

They have left themselves with no choice, except to annihilate their enemies, or be annihilated, & that is exactly how they behave - like all the Palestinians must be annihilated, all their land taken, in order for Israel to exist, at all. That is a corner they backed themselves into - when they showed no willingness to show compassion to their fellow humans, or seek out peace, thru diplomacy - always resorting to brute force to achieve purely selfish ends, instead of cultivating peaceful relations, in a land they reside in, thanks only to the concessions others have made, on their behalf.

How massive is the debt in Israel? Why is the USA funding the Iron Dome replenishment? Am I missing something, is funding some metaphor I'm unfamiliar with? I'd think Iron Dome is something important enough that Israel would fund it without handouts from Uncle Sam."

1,"""Liberals, progressives, Democrats and other rational thinkers must accept one crucial reality if they are to save America's democracy: Those who live in the right-wing echo chamber really do believe what they are being told. Those beliefs are now extensions of their core identities...

And as anyone who's watched Fox knows, its fundamental message is rage at what liberals are doing to our country. Over the years the specific message has changed with the times ‚Äî from terrorism to open borders to Benghazi to Christian cake bakers to critical race theory ‚Äî but it's always about what liberal politicians are doing to cripple America, usually with a large dose of thinly veiled racism to give it emotional heft...

The Fox pipeline is pretty simple. Fox News stokes a constant sense of outrage among its base of viewers, largely by highlighting narratives of white resentment and threats to Christianity. This in turn forces Republican politicians to follow suit. It's a positive feedback loop that has no obvious braking system, and it's already radicalized the conservative base so much that most Republicans literally believe that elections are being stolen and democracy is all but dead if they don't take extreme action."" - Unknown"

2,Yeah let's see if we could be a little more clueless Fox News. Maybe you missed the point where they said there was no point in funding it with the deficit cap bill because it's already part of a defense bill that's going to be passed later this year so there was no need to tack it on twice. Nobody said it's not getting funded it's just not going to be funded with this bill then with the other bill later when it's already been approved with the defense bill that going to be passed in December

2. You want to talk about abandoning allies. Trump was the first and only U.S. President to abandon our allies on the field of battle, abandon a U.S. base and turn them both over to our arch enemy Russia, who rolled in the next day. Trump got no Kurds out of Syria, not one. The ISIS prisoners then released following this betrayal were quite likely some of the same ones who later planned the attack and killed 13 U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.
Wake up."

Government is supposed to work for the people, not the super rich and not for big corporations."

1,"No one FORCES an ABORTION...but YOU want to FORCE a vaccine? My body, MY CHOICE...or isn't it!! Sit Down!!"
2,Probably because they would have to pay more in taxes.
2,"They make so when a lobbyist comes along offering them millions in perks, it's hard to say no. Our government has a pay structure well-suited to the 1970's, but now it's simply too far behind the scale of what these folks could make in the private sector. A lot of people think we pay our elected officials too much, but the problem is that we don't pay them enough to not take lobbyist money."
0,You're what I'd call a closet Republican.
2,Codify this law now!
0,"I read today the deficit was 7.8 trillion. When are the Democrats going to realize the Republicans are playing them. There is no intention of the republicans agreeing to anything for the present, they are looking at the future. You can see that in what Trump is doing by supporting all these people in state positions dealing with elections, if the the elections in the future is very close. Your dealing with some very nasty, corrupt individuals, that will stop at nothing, to cheat to win. An example is the last Supreme Court judge that shows how evil they are. Again they have cheated in the past when they didn't have the votes and changed it to 50 votes to win. You never trust Moscow Mitch McConnell and you should know that by now. You want to do something positive, start getting the people in the Republican Party with all the criminal activity they have done in the last plus decade. Get them removed from office and put in prison if possible. There supporters don't care how corrupt Trump and the Republicans are. The more corrupt they are the better they like it. You saw who supports them and the type of people they are. It's going to be interesting how hard the punishment will be for the people that were arrested for the insurrection, who was involved in the planning, and weapons that were used to murder the people that lost their life and the type of injuries that caused their wounds. The intent was to do bodily harm to anyone in their way of the attack."
2,"What happened to the billions we voted for and approved for new and expanded water storage??? Yeah,,,, didn't happen, did it!?"

It's like if a big company, pharma or oil company, were going to be judged in court and were slipping the judge large sums of money before hand.

0,This is why Sinema votes against everything the Democrats try to pass. This is also why she and Manchin vote against getting rid of the filibuster... They care less about America and change.

How those material things have divided the world, that you may claim you are living in your own world...wrong!!

Do you know what love is? Have you ever experience the love of the Lord in your life, your kids lives, your wife's life, your family? The love of money is the root of all evil.....What do you plan to do with the wealth that God has entrusted you with? Do you plan to share it with people in the love of God or your love?

If we want to fix shit, we've *got* to fix flyover country.  These people are desperate, and the only people even trying to sell them solutions they understand are doing so in bad faith.  It's why ""reopening the coal mines"" sells so well in West Virginia and Pennsylvania.  It's why trade protectionism plays well in Ohio and Michigan.  They think that imports cost them their jobs, and that coal demand is down because bad people have tried to undermine them--not that coal is simply not worth much anymore.

That‚Äôs not an economic subsidy. It‚Äôs federal programs that every American pays into and every American is entitled to draw from. The alternative is that an American worker is less worthy of social security (as a concept) based on where they live, which is stupid frankly. 

Happy to link the Rockefeller institutes research on this topic, which shows exactly what you would expect‚Ä¶ that a map of federal spending per capita is identical to a map of per capita elderly Americans, poverty, and disability rates.

0,"Age should also be measured starting at conception, then. Birthdays are now Conception Days. All human rights apply at six weeks of age. Men who beat their wives or otherwise induce miscarriage will be persecuted for first degree manslaughter in addition to domestic violence charges. Half of all medical costs paid by the father begins at six weeks. They will need to be added to health care coverage plans as well. No need for birth certificates there will now be Conception Identification with only a number until other information is obtained. Can a person legally not have a name? If not- you must be named as soon as conception is confirmed. As a zygote is now *life* a new *possible life* will likely be recognized. As such, male masturbation will be closely monitored and prohibited as it does not occur without external stimulation. Sex without procreative intent will be discouraged and you can bet birth control will be next to go. Any age restricted right will be measured from conception, obviously. The definition of life will need revision. Basic science and the seven characteristics of life no longer apply. So many nonliving things just became living. I‚Äôm not sure about this one but if the pregnancy or childbirth kills the mother doesn‚Äôt that make the person responsible the fetus? How would that work? Anyways- point is this whole idea is a stupid front for punishing and controlling women. You can bet that the rich will be getting abortions for their wives and the other poor women they knock up.

0,"The whole concept needs rebranding. ""Critical race theory"" is true American history. We Caucasians have a lot of blood on our hands. Teachers might do well to abandon that label and lose the thought that they are creating revolutionaries and stick to the facts: we stole and abused countless humans, and taught our children to hate and oppress said humans based on the color of their skin, and it took us more than two and a half centuries to begin to address the legacy of violence and hatred we created. Those are facts. 

That, and many of our most notable white inventors were likely to have been on the autism spectrum: Einstein, Tesla, even Jefferson.  If some of the newly minted eductors would ditch the inflammatory rhetoric, quit giving bonus points for protest attendance, stuck to the grim truths of American history, and taught critical thinking instead of trying to piss people off, this country might get somewhere.

The problem we have here is ignorant people trying to change the way we teach history and using CRT as the boogeyman to try to make that happen. They are fascists and like all good fascists, they see the schools as propaganda machines, not educational institutions.

Secondly, it's not right to pass the responsibility of a previous generation's actions onto the next.  No one should feel guilt or shame just because of the color of their skin.

1,"He's right though,  saying white people have blood on their hands because  the actions of people in the past or some people in the present is as racist as assuming black people as a group are responsible for the few black people who commit a disproportionate amount of violent crime, or blaming men for the few who commit a disproportionate amount of rape.

And white privilege  might exist, but the overly simplified heuristic that is used when discussing white privilege deeply flawed. One can't assume that just because  someone is white, they are automatically  privileged. There are so many many variables involved that may increase, decrease, or nullify any actual  privilege that just talking about it in such broad terms of all white people compared to all minorities as privileged or oppressed is completely useless and ultimately causes more conflict than help resolve anything."

2,"The view you hold of white privilege is one I held for a long time.  What it isn't saying is that white people have easy lives or no problems or an automatically easier life than people of color.  Unfortunately, that's how some people talk about it.

I grew up white in a small, poor, rural, farming town.  Lots of meth, lots of poverty, things were bad.  There was a lot of resentment to the idea of white privilege because, as you say, there are lots of levers and dials on how privileged someone is.  

White privilege is the truth that, if one of those people were black, their life would be harder and they would have to deal with more issues than they do currently.  It ISN'T taking away or minimizing what those people are going through.  It is acknowledging race is one of the bigger levers in the equation."

Do you even know why we have devaluation in the dollar?  Do you know how fiat currency actually works and the global coordination of currency markets?  

We had moderate to mild inflation for several decades until Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1970, which crashed the economy throughout the 70s.  Yet, we still managed to have no carry over debt for programs - even Vietnam.  But in the 70s, we started borrowing money like crazy from Japan, to the point where  a minister of education suggested we cede Hawaii to them in exchange for writing off the debt. 

Carter used monetarism to increase inflation significantly which lowered the value of the dollar to repay the Japanese their dollar indexed funds.  This decrease the amount we owed them by billions of dollars.  Yes, stagflation: double digit interest rates, double digit inflation and double digit unemployment.  Short term pain (like 8 years) for long term gain of not carrying foreign debt. 

But Congress couldn't control its spending, and decided to leverage the funds in social security instead.  Throughout the 80s and 90s that's where we borrowed from thus increasing the total debt.  Various members of Congress then opined mightily about the impending crash of Social Security and that it should be privatized, like Chile did.  Except, Chile's program crashed and burned. 

We've been borrowing money for 40 years.   Mysterious, uncontrolled digital currency won't change anything other than create yet another ponzi scheme where the people who get in first, profit and the people who get in late lose money.   With no transparency and no accountability - that's what crypto is: it's a Ponzi scheme."

2,"Firstly, I want to say thank you for being kind and respectful. I knew this post would be met with ire and aggressiveness. 

But to your point of backing, our current USD isn't backed by anything other than the trust and psychological agreedness that it equals x amount. Money is an arbitrary meaning just like lines in the dirt mean that a country, ""exists"" there. Granted, symbolism is EXTREMELY valuable. Symbolism has been used for great evil and great good. 

My point ultimately is, doomsayers leave room for others to take up the mantle as champions of the crypto space."
2,"That actually isn't correct.  The dollar is backed by the US Government.   It's fiat around the world with more than 20 countries that use it as their currency. 

As one of the dominant currencies in global currency baskets, mismoves by Congress or the Federal Reserve can have catastrophic global consequences.    

About crypto?  Who owns it?  Who oversees it?  Nobody  We see Elon Musk quite reliably pumping Dogecoin with a few weeks at the end of his fiscal quarter, and then dumping it a week after the books close.  

Bitcoin is heavily used by terrorists around the world for ransomware.  The mythical value is the anonymity, yet governments are showing success at seizing wallets used for crime.    Speaking of criminal terrorists, North Korea is one of the leading countries that use crypto for criminal activity.

If you lose all value in your crypto, the way it has happened to many people - who do you deal with to get partial indemnification or a refund?

Nobody.  Nobody.  This is exactly the model that caused multiple financial collapses in the United States from 1830 through 1880.  Five complete financial collapse, bank runs and depressions that lasted for years. 

Because of these collapses, we created the Federal Reserve to oversee currency and debt.  The closest we've come to a collapse was 2008 because of speculative investments.  Sound familiar?  That cost us more than $1 trillion to bring under control.

We have the FDC which exists to oversee financial institutions to protect consumers in the event of a collapse.  No crypto is FDC backed, meaning - a collapse in any crypto leaves it's investors without recourse, and no government backing means they'll never see a cent of it again.

That's why we don't support crypto  It's the subprime mortgage of financial instruments."
2,"My point exactly, USD is backed by the conglomerate agreedness that the US government will catch us if we fall. Just because USD is backed by the government doesn't make it's value any less psychological. 

If I say, my rock is more valuable because 1000 people find it valuable, does it make it any more valuable than the 500 people who think their rock has more value? Inherently no, because they both have psychological value not actually valuable. 

People made the same argument when we made the move away from gold backed USD. A new medium of exchange is necessary for a global economy to evolve. Using the empire of the United states of America as a basis for a financial system globally won't work forever."
2,"Unfortunately this is typical absolutism. The USD is run through every world nation and backed by 20 governments and trillions of dollars, and losses can be compensated.

Crypto *runs* based on wide psychological trust which you try to present as similar, but the scale is not even close. Further, Crypto is not backed by anybody. Lost wallets are not redeemed, stolen data, fraudulent exchanges can not be fought. When Bitcoin had its big early pop and exchanges promised to refund you in their shop's virtual currency rather than dollars, there was nothing you could do."

Brett kavanaugh perjured himself, I'm not even talking about the allegations of sexual misconduct. I'm talking about his ridiculous answers about his drinking and comments he made when he was a kid. 

The fact that one of nine heads of our entire judicial system, which is premised on getting to the truth and requiring people to tell the truth, would lie and be so evasive during his hearing has eroded my faith in this institution."
2,And one of them is an attempted rapist.
0,I believed Anita Hill.
1,Isn‚Äôt the far left a literal accused rapist himself and the bitch next to him was literally a handmaiden to a cult. This is crazy.
2,Two of those are sexual abusers.  The irony.
2,The Supreme Court is no longer credible or respectable as an institution.
0,"Three of the five were nominated by Trump. Next time you* try to tell me that presidential elections don't matter or that both parties are the same, please excuse me when I tell you* that you're* a fucking idiot.

*I mean the royal you, for example people that voted for Jill Stein in 2016."
0,"Agreed.  End the filibuster, pack the court."
2,"Or better yet, term limits on the court."

Neat court we have"

2,"Fuck Ralph Nadar 

Fuck Justice Kennedy for his bullshit reasons for retiring when he did

Fuck RBG for not retiring when she should have

Fuck Stephen Breyer for being just a selfish

And fuck Jill Stein voters"
2,"Only one of them was appointed by a President who won the popular vote.  Oddly enough under the McConnell rule, that's the one who would never have been seated if Democrats played by the same rules as Republicans."
0,Thomas is one of the figures in modern politics that I have a very strong unwavering dislike for.
0,Let's go...if we don't we are open to the American taliban
0,For a country that prided it self on separation of church and state we sure like to have our church in our state.
0,Four of them were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote
0,Kavanaugh should be impeached for lying under oath repeatedly. Barret shouldn‚Äôt be there at all. Democrats screwed the pooch on this and are doing nothing about it.
2,"SERIOUS QUESTION

Doesn't this just open the door for Republicans to dominate legislature and pack the courts when they're in charge?"
2,"Page 9 lines 13 thru 16 specifically say they can not. Laws still bullshit, but at least call it that for reasons it is not false ones."
2,"I read in the statute - rapists aren't allowed to receive the money, but they have to be convicted in order to be disqualified."
0,Balance the court! (...or Repair the Tampering) scans better than 'Pack the Court!'
0,"I will say I think we are lucky Trump decided to appoint Gorsuch rather than a more mainstream conservative- I've been pleasantly surprised by a number of his decision where he bucked the conservative wing of the court and sided with the liberals, mostly when American Indian rights were on the line. Only one of these I have an ounce of respect for despite my disappointment with a number of his other decisions.

With that said we really do need to end the filibuster and expand the court by 2 or so seats, whether permanently or only temporarily as has been done in the past."
0,Welp most are tRump appointees sooooooo raping ‚Äúnever knew her‚Äù and ‚Äúdamn it I love beer‚Äù
2,"I'm tired of screaming this. It's long past time. 

The SCoTUS does not represent our country. Not the majority. I'm sick over it"
0,They just gave the rape victims a reason for vigilantism.
2,"People keep telling me to end the filibuster. **How?** What can I, as an ordinary citizen, do?"
0,Guys they didn‚Äôt make a decision on it. The Texas law will most likely be struck down when it goes through the proper process
0,We must pack the Supreme court.
1,"Yet, Democrats show no willingness to be bold when in power.

Republicans take their minority to execute their vision, enact whatever they can‚Ä¶hold up nominations. Yet, little shits like Manchin bitch and moan about bipartisanship. Wake up you senile POS, bipartisanship only exists when Democrats are in power"
2,This is too kind.   There are some 74 million people in America who favor this outcome.
2,Wow 4 white ‚Äúeducated‚Äù individuals and a man who shouldn‚Äôt be around a judges seat
2,"Serious question... Doesn't this almost encourage rape?

You rape and have a potential to win 10 grand?"
0,The court's already been packed.  4 of then were appointed by Presidents that lost popular vote.  One of them holds a clearly stolen seat and another violated the dieing wishes of their predecessor.  This court has no legitimacy.  Dems should correct the court.
2,Trump lives with These 5
0,"Is it just me, but does Kavanaugh have a tiny ass mouth compared to his head"
2,"Can anyone site a source? I‚Äôve looked up but I can‚Äôt find anything. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs included in Texas‚Äôs new abortion law which outlaws abortions after six weeks, no exceptions."
0,"WTF? I'm irish, and I sometimes can't believe what I see the US do. How backwards do you have to be to introduce a law like this."
2,Just add one justice. Should be enough to stop this bullshit without being accused of packing it to tilt the court.
2,"Wait I know Kavanaugh was accused, who else was?"
0,"A mere 9 people, the majority of whom are right wing religious fascists, representing 330 MILLION is asinine. 

It is beyond time to expand the court. Why aren‚Äôt we doing this?!"
2,"The supreme court hasn't been a valid entity since Garland was denied his rightful seat. 

Reset it, reappoint all new justices. 3 must be dems. 3 must be reps, 3 independent

0,I never thought I‚Äôd see a picture of ‚Äúthe majority‚Äù (quotes for stolen seats) and be downright embarrassed these clowns represent the highest court in the land.
0,The Supreme Court also defended the internment of people during WW2. They've had a long history of ugly decisions.
0,"I'm old enough to remember when we had a 5-4 liberal majority on the SCOTUS.  It seems so fucking obvious how much the courts matter, but no matter how many times I say it, people just seem to refuse to get it.  I recall in 2016 so many people who didn't like Clinton saying things like, ""Quit trying to hold the court for ransom."""
2,Or didn't vote at all.
2,I will never forgive the Bernie-bro shitheads who (some still to this day) were so convinced HRC would have been ‚Äújust as bad‚Äù as Trump that they didn‚Äôt vote for her.
2,"Stop worrying about what bad thing the republicans are gonna do, if they need to do it they will, whether the dems do it first or not. How are people still falling for this?"
0,You also can't sue the woman who had the abortion.  Only those who aided and abetted her.
0,"And considering how infrequently rape is successfully prosecuted, particularly in Texas..."
0,"1.  Volunteer with your local chapter of the Democratic party.  Party planks and platforms are often written by the small number of people who bother to show up.  Having been involved with local democratic politics throughout my teens and early adulthood (I've had to stop since it's considered a conflict of interest with my current job) I can assure you, the people showing up are not always the people we want writing the party platform.  Most the people showing up have big financial interests in getting certain things done.  If we want democracy to work, we need to be more active in it.

2.  Vote in every election, especially at the local level.  The local level has huge influence on your day to day life, your vote carries more weight at the local level, and our next national level candidates have to get their start somewhere.  Voting in every election also means doing your homework.  Get to know the candidates.  For my most recent state delegate primary, I had a chance to talk with both the individuals on the ballot and got a solid feel for both.  It was clear the less funded guy was better to me, but he lost pretty decisively.  So few people do the homework so the woman with the slick mailers won.

3.  Run yourself.  As I already said, democracy only works if we work it.  If the people running aren't getting the job done, then someone else needs to step up.  And frankly, I'd rather vote for the reluctant candidate running to do the right thing than the person who really wants power.  I'm afraid of people who want power.

You'll notice my advice has nothing to do with this particular issue.  That's because if we don't get the foundation right, we will never be able to get the big stuff right.  It's all hard work I propose, no easy answers I fear."
0,Call your senator and tell them to vote yes to end the filibuster.
2,"All of reddit is acting like they upheld the law, which isn't what happened"
2,"Reset the court. Mandate 3 Republican, 3 Dem, and 3 Independent judges. 

Each party elects their judges when one retires, the independents get added as they are now by the president"
1,Why do you think that is? Personally I think it‚Äôs because the Democratic Party here is designed to be nothing more than controlled opposition
0,It‚Äôs already been ‚ÄúPacked‚Äù by right wingers. It needs to be unpacked.
2,"Ignore posters like this, only trying to bring down enthusiasm to get out and VOTE!"
2,"Well said. Biden needs to UNPACK the court. They literally just adopt Republican framing and say ‚Äúno it isn‚Äôt‚Äù absolutely hopeless. 

Democrats are supposed to be sophisticated and media savvy. Get yourself shit together Democrats.

If Biden added 3 more justices, Democrats would win re-election because of the courage and conviction of the move."
1,Yes no exceptions for rape and incest
2,"

A rapist could collect by suing his victim, as described in this post."
2,And how people feel the need to defend dirtbags like these. Good for you. They're trash. The way they voted proves it.
2,Because they care more about getting reelected.
0,"We don‚Äôt officially have a two or three party system. If republicans continue down the road to fascism and sane republicans branch out into a new party, you‚Äôre still stuck with fascists on the court and no provisions for the new protestant republicans. 

It also ignores proportions- independents would have a disproportionate representation."
0,"Married to Karen: [ In 2009, Thomas started Liberty Central, a conservative political advocacy nonprofit associated with the Tea Party movement.   
Thomas supported Donald Trump during his presidency, offering his administration recommendations on individuals to hire through her work with the conservative coalition Groundswell. Thomas made an early social media endorsement of the Trump rally that preceded the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol."
1,"I doubt if that pains you otherwise you wouldn't have brought it up. Does it pain you that the African-American community was split on Clarence Thomas with men supporting him and women supporting her? Or that other Democrats voted to confirm Thomas?

Of course not. Your goal was to smear the POTUS."
0,"Agreed. I'm more disgusted than anything. Barrett should have been a judge appointed by Biden. Same with Gorsuch with Obama. The Supreme Court would then be more representative of US. 

These three new judges are just shills for the Republicans."
2,He won't fucking retire while we have the Senate.
2,"That doesn't seem true. 

If they were in the Dems position, would you want them to remove the filibuster and pack the courts?"
2,"Both parties could have removed the filibuster many times. Neither did because of the concerns it raises when they are now in power.

I'm unconvinced they will, but if Dems remove it, they will overrun them entirely when they next have a slim majority."
2,"What stops an out of state telemedicine company simply posting the pills to somebody who wants an abortion?

1,Democratic leaders are doing that on their own. Don‚Äôt blame anyone else.
2,"The number of new justices needs to be even, to keep the total odd.

I have no remaining confidence that I can predict why someone would win the presidential election, just the same as I no longer understand what we're disagreeing over or where the center line is."
1,So Democrats are on board with Christo-fascism or is this about the so-called ‚Äòmoderates‚Äô and independents? I say fck ‚Äòem. This shit is dead serious. They get re-elected to a fascist country that‚Äôs about to do away with elections? Seems like a shortsighted take.
0,"You don't recognize the fascists. Sweep them all under the Republican label and you neuter their worst tendencies. 

Independents should have disproportionate representation in an non-partisan court system that is designed to be the arbiter of constitutional, or unconstitutional laws across the land"

1,"Criticizing Biden is a bad thing? How is that something to be mad about? He's made mistakes in the past, he's not perfect, I don't agree with all his positions. 

And just so you know, he was criticized for it back then."
2,"Maybe, but I critique Biden and I'm a supporter. It's healthy to disagree ‚ò∫Ô∏è n reasonable grounds."
0,"Why is criticism of Biden off limits. The man has made a lot of wrong choices in his career. No one is perfect, and the fact that the African American community was split on Thomas is irrelevant. 

Let‚Äôs just hope that Biden makes the right decision now and gets behind the movement to expand the court."
2,This is America- we still get to criticize our electeds
2,Did you sleep through the entire Trump administration? They've already done it.
2,"They refused to even confirm Obama's judges, but when Trump came, they approved judges with a rubber stamp."
2,"Because they didn't need to in order to pack the courts in their favor.  All they had to do was refuse to vote on Obama's elected judges, so they could give them to Trump.

If they'd needed to expand the courts to get them packed, they wouldn't have hesitated."
2,Call senator Sinema at 202-224-4521 and senator Manchin at 202-224-3954
2,"We have to make it happen. The supreme court was willed into existence extra-constitutionally. We can will it into anything we want with the correct votes. Notably, this will not happen with either party in power pushing their own agenda. It has to be done when the court is evenly split"
2,"Yeah. It seems the party wants to ‚Äúwin‚Äù on their terms, only in certain ways they feel is appeasing. It is not good enough to win, they want to win while looking good and having broad communal support and that is simply not possible.

I see it in uber colleagues all the time. They want to win while feeling superior."
2,Haven‚Äôt heard a single ‚Äúdemocratic leader‚Äù say the shit you‚Äôre saying.
2,No I'm with you. That was my cynicism speaking before. I mean I just can't think of any reason why the dems wouldn't fill the court with judges when they have complete control if not for their own worry over re-election... To yeah get the moderate and independant votes.
2,You missed the point of the example. If any party loses support and dies due to radicalism they still have huge representation in the court under your proposal.
0,I quite like Biden and I think you‚Äôre completely right. We‚Äôre not trump supporters who look at the president and think he‚Äôs gods gift to our cause. He‚Äôs a human and he makes mistakes. Hell Anita Hill herself endorsed him in the last election despite everything that happened back then.
0,"Just so you know, the African-American community was split on the Clarence Thomas nomination. Of course, you didn't mention that Biden and the other Democrats were caught in a difficult situation. You pretend Biden acted unilaterally and alone. Your goal is obvious: to casually smear Joe Biden."
0,"Too bad your claim wasn't reasonable, huh? Odd how you failed to mention that the African-American community was split on the Thomas nomination, huh?

But then your goal was to blame Biden. Mentioning the pressure put on him by African-American men wouldn't serve your purpose, would it?"
1,">Why is criticism of Biden off limits. 

Smears are not criticism. Nice try."
2,"It's not, but I don't exactly see why we need to bring up Biden's role in the Thomas nomination every time we point out what a shit head Thomas is.  It's like we're desperately trying to advance the both sides narrative.  Thomas is objectively worse than Biden in almost every conceivable way, and while Biden has gone on since those hearings to do good things, Thomas has been a thorn in the side of democracy, justice and basic human decency ever since.  

I see no value in flogging Biden at every opportunity for what he did 30 years ago."
2,Your proposal would make congress more extreme on both sides. I don't think it's a good idea.
0,"We're talking about expanding the number of judges. I'm unconvinced Republicans would do that.

They are definitely immoral enough to have coerced Kennedy into retirement with something about his son, though. And they are unamerican enough to not hold a vote on Gorsuch."
2,"That's a valid point, but one where we want to expand the war to blowing out the Supreme Court each time there's a party switch?"
0,"I'm actually not convinced of that very last point, but that they practically packed it by not reviewing Gorsuch I do agree. 

I had never seen something so deeply unamerican in my life to that point."
0,"Of course Democrats want to ""win"", that's the whole job of a party and lawmakers. But they need to be strong, and stop pretending the GOP is there to help in good faith."
0,Because they haven‚Äôt said shit. They allow Conservatives to continue their bullshit unchecked. We don‚Äôt stand a chance because they‚Äôve allowed the wrong people to put pieces in place which allow them to continue spreading lies and stealing and rigging elections. Just like Georgia.
2,"People hold ideas, they don't die with parties. They die on their own.

If a new party replaces an old one, they would simply take over that share of the court"
0,"Trump supporters think we like Biden, no matter what, and he's our god. While they can't even look 5 inches from their face to see they worship Trump the same way.

I don't think he's perfect, and I don't want to worship him because I think acting like that towards a politician is just dumb IMO. But I like him for his decency, tolerance and his policies. 

If you watch Last Week Tonight, I highly recommend watching John's interview with Anita Hill."
2,Definition of smear: ‚Äúdamage the reputation of (someone) by false accusations; slander.‚Äù
0,"Let‚Äôs see if he makes the right choice this time. Like I said, I would hope that he has the guts to take a stance and get behind the push for expanding the court. This Supreme Court is completely broken. It‚Äôs a bunch of crazy right wingers with an agenda to undo all of the progress that has been made in the last 100 years. The filibuster is already going to be the reason the dems will loose seats in 2022, and McConnell would have already gotten rid of it if the dems were doing the same thing. In my opinion Biden and the rest of the conservative dems need to grow a pair and get things done, or we are going to loose the country."
0,">no one WANTED Biden to be nominated.

And possibly spread some fun lies of our own"
0,With McCarthy. Didn't we already have one dumb congressman named McCarthy already. There should be a law....
2,Even Bill Barr called the riot outrageous and a betrayal of Trumps office. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact Bill Barr is a Corrupt piece of shit.

2,"Obviously.  Too many people fall for optics over substance.


None of the previous administrations had the spine to end the war."
2,The tribal way of life in Afghanistan won.  We tried to force democracy and our beliefs on them for 20 years.  Kabul is the capital and largest city of Afghanistan. They couldn't convince the rest of the country to adopt a whole new world.  The country is tribal and Islam¬†is the official religion of Afghanistan. That never changed.
1,"Someone needs to tell the Afghans freedom isn‚Äôt free. They ought to earn their own freedom through hardship, fight and sacrifice."
2,"You‚Äôre absolutely right. The reality in Afghanistan never changed. Both Karzai and Ghani have spent a large amount of the foreign aid to bribe tribal leaders or face their armed resistance. That‚Äôs the way Afghanistan runs, plain and simple. Obama should‚Äôve left right after Bin Laden was eliminated and disregard Bush‚Äôs rebuilding mission that wasn‚Äôt the reason why we went there in the first place. Democracy is something nations have to fully understand and embrace or it‚Äôll fail. The struggle in Rome after the assassination of Julius Caesar boiled down to pro-monarchy versus the supporters of the Republic. Democracy is an everlasting struggle that every generation must fight for."
0,">The American right has been drunk on its freedom from two kinds of

their own actions out of respect for the rights of others and the   
collective good. Those already strained limits have snapped for leading   
Republican figures, from Tucker Carlson on Fox News to Ted Cruz in the

0,Why do the MAGAts always accuse old people of having dementia? Do they think every old person is like Trump and Reagan?
2,"Because they can‚Äôt. The Democratic Party has been neutered by the right wing so that if they enact anything, it‚Äôs seen as/ on muh rights‚Äù. I mean, you should see what some of the spin doctors on the other side are doing."
2,"Because we want to make the world better, not just be assholes about stuff?"
1,"Democrats are, collectively, wimps. We hardly ever push back in any meaningful way."
2,"I agree. Democrats are constantly on their back foot. Democrats are like look at the data, look at the facts, we can save / help / enhance / invest in _______. And that‚Äôll help 90% of Americans. Republicans can drop a meme about Venezuela and socialism and rally 50% of the electorate. Republicans now days appeal to fear of the other, nostalgia, and the base tendencies of their base.

Don‚Äôt expect anything to get better. Don‚Äôt expect a splinter party of traditional Republicans to emerge in a meaningful way and get the rank and file to ‚Äòcome to their senses‚Äô. 

The future is a dysfunctional, dystopian mess. Crappy roads, crumbling schools, bigger prisons, the endemic presence of Covid-19, and fewer rights for women and minorities.

This ideology is not justifiable in any working society and you see this played out over and over. So to be a democrat at this moment means against that. Unfortunately that is the stark reality.
2,"In my opinion we are all independents. Dem or Republican are labels for the politicians. I like some ideas from both sides or at least I used to. Republicans like to control spending which I agree with. Only I think that spending control should all go toward the defense budget which gop loves to over inflate. 

From the things you said you liked, you are def more Democrat as Republicans actively want all those to go away.they hate unions. Hate regulations. Hate employee protections. Want no min wage. Want no osha. Want people working more hours and less days off. Democrats don't like big govt they think the govt should be there to help people when they need it and protect people when they can. Gop uses that to con people into saying dems want to control our lives. Which is what they want to do while claiming they are getting govt off people backs. Whatever that means. They want high taxes for the middle and lower class and no taxes for the rich. And they are almost all rich themselves while the Democrats have alot of ppl that were part of the working class before getting elected."

2,"Appreciate his bravery but it really is pointless to let your political views be known on liberal echo chambers like Twitter. Sad to see it cost him his job. Dont know much about the video game development world in terms of politics, but hopefully he can find work after this."
2,the more power you give these people the more lives they destroy over political disagreement. pure psychopaths
2,God will provide for this man. Good for him to help spread love and not hate.
2,We have to support people like this. We must provide a soft landing spot for people who get cancelled like this if we ever expect to win the culture war. We cannot continue to just let those brave enough to support our side wither and die when the mob comes after them.
1,So the takeaway is don't have an opinion unless it lines up with the crooked left Nazi Germany.
2,That‚Äôs messed up. We are being silenced for anything.
1,"At this point there can't be any reconciliation. The left wants things inherently un American, has a serious lack of morals, and revels in destruction and indoctrination.  Read any subs here about politics or anything for that matter, and Twitter, and see how truly vile the left is. They aren't liberals anymore. They're leftists."
1,That‚Äôs terrible I swear these leftist and huge companies are afraid of a issue that shouldn‚Äôt be in question. Snowflakes at the finest. Smh
2,"It‚Äôs sad that these losers are canceling people for supporting life! 
It‚Äôs okay to wish death on people for not being vaccinated though! SMH"
1,Baby killing seems so important to a part of our society
2,So much for freedom of speech.......
2,We need to publicly shame that company which is obviously run by Nazis.
2,This Abortion law has to have an exception for rape victims or underage girls. Otherwise it‚Äôll get taken down.
1,"Remember when almost everyone condemned abortion and being pro-life wasn't controversial. I was called ""edgy"" for supporting this man. No I just didn't throw away my moral compass and still understand the difference between right and wrong. 
  When you're championing the murder of innocents as a sacred right and so happy satanist are trying to protect your cause you might want to try and find that compass.."

1,"I wish we as a group got angry enough to start doing that to them. ""Wait, this CEO just shared that if you die of COVID and didn't get the vaccine that it's good? They wished death on these people? We want them fired!""

Not that canceling is good, but maybe if we started doing it to them then they can agree with us and form a majority that frowns upon canceling and maybe it will finally stop."
2,I actually wish this could have waited til after the midterms. I just feel they will use this as their justification for stacking the court. If that happens this country is in for a freefall
1,"No it doesn't. Nor does it have to have ""exceptions for life of the mother"" either. The latter is the only possibly compelling exception and even then it falls flat on its face because in no other realm is failure to medically save (in this case the baby) applicable to murder. 

You cannot fail to save with malice aforethought and despite taking every reasonable action still murder the person. That's just nonsense because the malice aforethought part is contradictory to the actions trying to save another. Doctors aren't perfect and fail to save people all the time and it's not murder. So why would it be any different for the unborn child that you suggest abortion be legal so that they can be killed? It doesn't make sense. Either the child is going to die regardless what you do and you can save the mother, or the child lives and the mother lives.

So no, the law doesn't need to make any exceptions for this. If you murder the child, you should be punished. Period."
2,"> This is a standard across the board for people in tthe public eye who have a company backing them.

1,"I agree, but it's incredibly frustrating that if you hold liberal views you're free (and even sometimes rewarded) for being as loud about them as possible.

Company leaders (who inherently represent all working under them) should keep political opinions to themselves regardless of where they fall on the political spectrum, but that condition is currently only half true."

1,You don't need to be religious to believe a fetus is a human being.... wtf lol
2,This isn't overreach at all. Even the provision of using the civil courts to enforce it isn't overreach. It does the next best thing possible to calling it murder like it should be and enforcing it by state law enforcement: It puts the enforcement in the hands of the people instead of the state or federal government.
2,Agree but I always ask how are they only 51% of the votes then? Must be rural v urban thing.
1,"Ha it doesnt even need to be a political sub. It could be... About puppy dogs. Someone makes a political comment on a picture of a husky puppy that is related to democratic ideology. You answer with your conervative ideology, you get banned.

1,"They still won't get the court packing. They know they'll lose big time if they pack the court. They're already up against the redistricting and the increased security against exploiting mail in voting in several of the swing states they used to put Biden in, the first midterm after a president's first term is the hardest to maintain for the president's party and the president is already in hot water with the whole Afghanistan debacle. Plus if Harris gets 25thed into the white house between now and then, it's even worse because everybody will be coming out to stop her. That's why Biden only did the commission instead of just nominating new justices. Also Pelosi's commission isn't really moving very well. Even the social media platforms, facebook included are starting to regret propping up the democrats because now they want to come after them with regulations not to make them uphold free speech which they were afraid of under Trump, but to censor more than they can handle without hurting their bottom line. Add to that people's weariness with the pandemic and the flipflopping of government officials on what actions need to be taken to mitigate COVID and it looks less and less good for the Democrats.

The US is a shitshow right now."
2,"It does though, It doesn't have rape and incest, which is ick, but it does have a mother's life clause or whatever"
1,"That's because it doesn't actually have to. Failing to save an unborn baby because we're unable to do so is not abortion. That's a miscarriage, even if facilitated by surgery to remove the child from a fallopian tube. The child is guaranteed to die in that case and so it's not murder to save the mother's life by removing the child whole from the mother and allowing that to happen without killing the mother."
0,"Started out very eloquently but kinda did a bit of mental gymnastics there. Thank you for your opinion. So is it safe to say a 13 year old rape victim should follow through with pregnancy even if it kills her?

2,I will vote and I will pay attention to the news but I am done putting the news on a pedestal in my life. Not long ago my day shifted based on how bad the news was and every day it was bad so my days were all bad. Eventually I just decided to leave the room when the news is on and only read off of this subreddit. I‚Äôm still keeping my eyes open to the possibilities but now I‚Äôm slowing down on the politics. Now i sadly watch my dad fall deeper and deeper into this political hole and lose care for everything.
1,"That is an interesting question and I think you are seeing the statements that conservatives typically make regarding individual liberty (i should be able to make my own decisions because I am free to do so, I just have to deal with the consequences of that decision) and relating it to this issue. Is that the case? I'm sorry if it isn't, that's just the connection that I see and would appreciate clarification if I'm incorrect. 
I think the distinction is that we regard the pregnant woman and the unborn baby as individuals with inherent value simply because they are human. That idea has ramifications. We believe both of those individuals have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. So because the baby is a living individual, it has a right to life and should be provided that as much as we are able. Additionally, the destruction of a life, which we would say begins at conception, at the hands of another is murder, which is something we believe is wrong.
I hope this helps. If you have any more questions or would like to discuss things more, feel free to dm me. I know I'm not always the best at clearly articulating my view, so I would be glad to discuss it further."
2,Wow. And what is your basis for this punishment? Religion?
2,What is your basis for the punishment for murder? Or do you not believe murderers should be punished?
2,"It is encouraging to hear that my response was helpful. Thank you.
I agree that is important to listen to the opposing side. I find i often become arrogantly certain that I am absolutely correct when I either just think through it on my own or only listen to those that agree with me. But hearing the other side often adds perspective or brings up things that I didn't consider. This doesn't always change my position, but it helps me consider more aspects than I originally did which is important to having opinions about the world as a whole and how different things work together."
2,Murder of a human or murder of a fetus?
0,"I get that ""pro-life"" see life at conception, but why not also support adequate sex education and contraceptives instead of abstinence only to prevent unwanted pregnancies, and welfare to help these kids after they are born so the mother doesn't feel like she needs to abort because she has no future?"
2,Just murder. Or rape. Or any crime that should be punished. What is your basis for punishing crime in general?
1,"Thank you for your questions. As before I think those are important questions to ask especially since they can have a big impact on the lives of people involved. 
Would you expand on what sex education would look like? I think I would agree that sex education is important. I don't always agree with how it is put into practice (for example I live in a state that begins sex education in kindergarten. In my opinion that is far too early to begin discussing that topic). So if you clarify what you would desire in that regard, I could give you my opinion in that area. 
In regards to your point on abstinence verses other options, my personal belief is that sex is something reserved for marriage. In holding that view, I acknowledge that others do not hold that view. So I would hold abstinence as the ideal. That's what I believe people should do, but since they aren't going to, providing instruction in the other areas would be beneficial, but I would still emphasize the ideal. I don't believe contraceptives are wrong, I just don't think they are best before marriage. 
I think another reason abstinence is promoted over the other options is that no matter how effective the other options are, there is still a chance that it doesn't work, while with abstinence, it should be entirely effective because if you don't participate in the act that gets you pregnant, you can't get pregnant. Actions have consequences, if you do not want to be pregnant or to deal with a child, the most effective way to prevent that is to avoid participating in the activity that results in pregnancy. If you participate in that activity, you risk the result. 
I don't know that this specifically answers your questing, but one objection I personally would have to welfare being used as a solution is I don't believe it is the government's job to take care of children whose parents would struggle to provide for them. Instead I would say it is the responsibility of the people in that community to come alongside that mother and assist her in the provision and raising of that child. One of the ways this manifests is through charity like Pregnancy Resource Center and individuals seeing the need of that mother and child. 
If a person is truly holding to the pro-life view, they must continue to value the life of that child after they are born and so must be willing to do what it takes to protect that life. The child doesn't cease to be valuable as a human just because they have left the protection of their mother's womb. 
As before I hope I was helpful. If you have any questions or would like clarification, you are welcome to dm me. Thank you for your time."

2,white privilege
1,"Republicans are usually opposed to unchecked and illegal immigration, expecting some level of assimilation or cultural affinity before being allowed to enter the country.

2,"I think it's, for every 100,000 people who were born in Denmark, 0.7 persons have committed and was convicted of a rape. So for 200k 1.4 was convicted.

For those of Somali origin over 25 have been convicted. This doesn't even include Somalis who were born in Denmark because it's by country of origin"
2,"You're right, probably missing some context, or maybe is the definition of rape that differs"
2,"I wont down vote you yet, I will give you a chance to come up with proof of your claim. Please provide a link to validate that this claim that these stats are faked.  


Also, note that not all, but a lot of times when republicans disagree with stats its because there is a reason to besides they hurt my feelings. Like there are conflicting reports. Like a month or so ago when the CDC said Florida's daily covid death rates where through the roof, but come to find out the CDC had messed up the data and took a 3 day death total and displayed it as happening in 2 days. There were news articles proving this mistake, in that instance, yes republicans disagreed with stats because they were proven wrong.  


On that note I am giving you a chance to prove this wrong.  


But, while these links don't confirm these actual stats they do confirm the sentiment that the refugees from africa and the middle east are causing crime and rape problems in europe.

2,"You are right, in this statistic you need to take into account weather getting that statistic uses a general definition of rape or if it uses it's own countries law or definition of rape which it's actually surprising how laws differ extremely from country to country.

However even if their using the country of origins laws you would still have to wonder why Denmark has a low rape count? Do they have extremely strict laws or are they hiding their cases from us? Does Denmark stack up in comparison to other western countries(where the laws would be somewhat similar, obviously there would be some differences between them all) and would that show us something vastly different in comparison?

Also, if you were to look at the stat through a different lens like ""ohh well Denmark is just more civil"" or something of the sort then suddenly this has a vastly different meaning to what is presented as truth.

In other words, this statistic paints a pretty incomplete picture and it would help if it had something to drive the point home that wasn't itself."
2,"Or they just have less rapes in general. If you only have 2 rapes per 100,000 people, it would end up that you are arresting around 35% of them which is about twice as high as the rate of the US."

2,"I appreciate the opportunity, but I don‚Äôt really know, and I never purported to.  I am however, skeptical, and I always am when I see online tables because statistics can be manipulated!  And to this fact, there is no arguing.  There are entire libraries filled with books about how statistics can be misleading and purposefully deceitful.  

To reiterate and be clear, I simply disagreed with the prevailing sentiment and pointed out that statistics can be misleading. I have not done research into this specific instance, and I don‚Äôt care to.

As far as statistics being misleading, I am not going to link a bunch of articles you probably won‚Äôt read."
2,Less reported rapes* or else the families honor is shot
2,"Yup, in their culture it's not rape, shouldn't be in the same graph. 

Also, we should most likely start going by their laws in order to be inclusive."
1,"Ok, so to be clear, I gave you an opportunity to defend your statement that this table is false. And you essentially refuse to take it, saying you don't care to research the topic and based on your edit only spoke up in defiance of the information because you want to mirror republican behavior.

But like I said, and proved, above. When we disagree we often have evidence to back it up. We don't disagree because the information provided hurt our feelings.

Also you say stats can be and are manipulated. I 100% agree with you. I have an example.

The other day I saw a news clip that said, ""vaccinated people have a 99.999% survival rate. Unvaccinated people are 25 times more likely to die"" that sounds drastic! 99.999% survival rate vs 25 times more likely to die... Let's do that math.

100 - 99.999 = 0.001 (chance of death while vaccinated)

0.001 x 25 = 0.025 (25 times more likely to die while unvaccinated)

100 - 0.025 = 99.975% chance of survival for unvaccinated people.

Yet people are losing careers over vaccine mandates... For a vaccine that doesn't prevent you from contracting or transmitting. It doesn't even prevent you from dying. For an experimental technology (mRNA) that has never gone past lab trials before this year so there is ZERO long term effect studies.

See when republicans reject things, we typically have logic and facts to justify our stance."
2,"No we shouldn't why should we placate a bunch of murdering, terrorist, rapists?"
0,"I was responding to a comment about statistics being xenophobic. I simply stated that was false and foolish and that statistics can be misleading.



Denmark is the fifth most safe country in the world, and while mainstream news admits there are issues in respect to this area,



The reality is that reporting lags behind. I don‚Äôt know the reason for this, but since under reporting is rampant, it makes sense that criminal convictions would follow suit.  Instead of blaming a minority, this article describes a traumatizing process as the major issue.



This article expands on how antiquated the laws are, specifically calling for changes to acquaintance rape, the most common type of rape.  

The statistics are misleading because people are using it push a false narrative which blames refugees coming from a particular locality. It fails to account for the realities of the law and the people living there.  In short, statistics are misleading, and some people in this community are pushing their own narrative instead of actually doing the legwork."

1,Fauci was a driving force and had significant input into funding the Wuhan lab...that's why he was soo protective when the virus was released....he's sketchy as hell...why is the US funding a research lab in Wuhan?

2,Why doesn't this apply to Gen Milley who stated that then President Trump was planning a coup?
2,"Under most circumstances I would agree, however I'm looking at this from a different view. The current administration has become a clear danger to America. There are circumstances under which a military officer is not only justified but also obligated to disobey a legal order
[refusing an order ](

With that said, It's not active duty military we should be depending on to call out the government. 
It's the American people aka private citizens that should be calling them out.
The current administration has become a clear danger to America and its citizens. 

Thomas Jefferson¬†(1743-1826) in the Declaration of Independence:

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature‚Äôs God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation‚Ä¶.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.‚ÄîThat to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. ‚Äî That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness‚Ä¶ it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.****"

2,"As a member of the American military, your duty is first and foremost the protection of the American people...even from their own government. He may have broken the rules, but the rules aren‚Äôt always right and he remains a hero nonetheless. May he one day walk through parades honoring him and be showered with accolades and medals for having the bravery and courage to do what so few individuals would ever even consider doing. Truly an American hero."
2,What about baby face vindman‚Äôs treason?
2,"He didn't even say anything directly aimed at Joe Biden. Listen to the original video. He says he wants ""...accountability from his superiors..."". Where is the contemptuous word in that statement? Shouldn't we ALL want accountability at every level of our armed forces?

I served four years 0311, for those of you who know what that means. Accountability was _huge_ at every level. Why is the Corps today _any_ different?"
1,Biden is a pos
2,Sounds like some North Korean military law or some shit
1,"Who is upvoting the original post? It's a troll post. He simply asked for accountability for the extremely fucked up withdrawal of Americans from Afganistan. Biden didn't even notify NATO of our withdrawal plans. 13 Dead marines. $84 billion of military equipment,  weapons, and vehicles given to terrorists. Taliban going door to door executing Americans and Afgans that helped us. Biden couldn't have fucked it up much worse if he tried."

2,Pretty sure he just shit on the generals. Not too mention he resigned his commission anyways.
2,Don‚Äôt military members swear an oath to the constitution? Would defending it against all enemies foreign or domestic not constitute commanders giving bad orders? Bad orders being ones that get say 13 military killed?

2,Because he didn't publically say anything. It was written by a reporter without his consent or confirmation. He further reinforced that military is apolitical when questioned on it.
2,Well then you should just get on with your treasonous goal to overthrow the government and quit pussyfooting about.
2,The proper way to speak out is via the chain of command.  I said when his statement went public that he was opening himself up to an Article 88 charge.

2,I‚Äôm sure many in the German Army during the 40‚Äôs thought the same.
2,Which is against the code he agreed to follow as a commissioned officer - he could of resigned his commission and then flapped his gums all damn day - he didn't until after he violated the Uniform Code - he even knows he's guilty - and getting damn close to sedition the more he talks
2,"Officers and soldiers are sometimes given bad orders.  They are expected to follow them, regardless.

The exception is orders that are illegal - soldiers are expected to disobey an illegal order - however, they will have to defend doing so in a court martial (though in wartime they might not make it that far).

The issue here is that this Lt. Colonel was not personally given an illegal order, so he had no grounds to disobey one.  At present, we don't know of any other instance where anyone involved was given an illegal order.  We know lots of **stupid** orders were given, but even so, not to this LTC.

What he did was violate the UCMJ, possibly in several particulars.  He will be lucky to not see prison as a result."
2,"So you want every swinging d*ck in the military debating what are good and bad orders and deciding which to obey and ignore?

13 deaths is going to look like nothing when that disfunction hits."
1,"Nope

""Prior to the UCMJ creation in the 1950's, this particular rule was required by military officers even before America was officially a country.""

2,"He has refused to speak about it. When you are misquoted and it can forever taint your reputation you have to vehemently speak out. 
He hasn't.

He will be addressing the Foregin Relations committee, let's see how that goes."
2,"1st of all it would have to be a legitimately elected government before it could be called treason.
 Also I'm not talking about overthrowing anything. 
I simply pointed out legal references to why a military officer could do this, 
And to show how it is the people responsible to speak against this administration so that the military can legally remove them. Who said I'm pussy footing around. Not all of us are scared to speak out."
1,Yeh well sometimes you have to speak your peace.  Fuck political correctness when 13 are dead and biden is a fuck up !
1,"Quite clear you didn‚Äôt do military service. 

You complete a mental health exam EVERY year, so don‚Äôt buy into he had one because he criticized the president. He completed one because he was required to complete his annual. 

Joe Biden blatantly put marines in danger, despite an abundance of military intelligence without a single doubt telling him exactly what is going to happen months before the Taliban even took Kabul. 

He blatantly disregarded intelligence, armed the Taliban to the teeth so when we inevitably go in next it will be a slaughter, and made one of the worst military decisions possibly any president has made. 

We abandoned our allies, are openly being disrespected across the world, and made this world a lot more dangerous of a place because of his immaturity. 

Or are we going to talk about the blatant disrespect for every dead service member brought home according to a barrage of witnesses‚Äô and gold star families?  

This president is effectively the sole reason for tens of thousands of deaths and ensured many more to come in the future. 

Calling out this administration for the blatant disregard for human life is only right, if he faces jail time so be it, he did the right thing.

The military may not be a ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù, but having completely arrogant and disastrous leadership that directly leads to the death of the men you swore to protect under your command, you morally have a right to say something."
2,"Yes, it‚Äôs unfortunate how poorly American heroes are compensated."
2,"Yeah I don‚Äôt understand, he‚Äôs not smart enough to just wait? Like they‚Äôre all corrupt we already knew that why throw ur whole career away there‚Äôs no honor in it"
1,Bullshit. He actively spied on Trump. Get rekt lib.
1,"No, Bidens approval rating is among the worst of any President in history, and it's because of Afganistan.  Gas prices are doubled. Inflation the highest its been in 40 years. Still millions of Americans out of work because our economy is shit. Democrats extended unemployment way too long and paid bonuses to people too lazy to look for a job. Many businesses closed because they couldn't find workers. 
 So you're full of crap if you think a majority support attacking an honest General that told the truth about Afganistan. Even the deep state leaked Bidens phone call with the Afganistan president asking him to lie about the Taliban having power."
2,The military isn't a democracy.
2,"The German Army has never been under the UCMJ, and the situations are not remotely similar."
2,Just seems people can give orders that result in deaths and get no punishment. Someone speaks against those people who directly caused others to get killed and they go to prison.
0,"He didn't respond because Uniform Code requires him not to speak on political matters which is what he said - I'm not defending him I'm answering a question as to why he is not in violation - when did the GOP become so touchy Feely - he broke the code,  - he's undisciplined - military discipline is crucial to the national defense - end"

Declare your independence and get to fighting. Otherwise 

If you don't love it, leave it

1,It's not political correctness. It military law to maintain order and discipline.
1,"...and when you violate the UCMJ to do so, there can be consequences (unless you are a leftist)."
2,You get to say all that because your not in the military - he doesn't cause he is - he could have resigned and said anything he wanted - he didn't so he violated military law - it ain't about your feelings - it's about maintaining discipline
2,"Yeah that's why I said none. 

Thought it made more sense to work here to build America than nation build in the Middle East.

Interesting timing on his annual ""Schelle acknowledged that he was the one who was forced to undergo a mental health screening after his initial video."""
2,He's was a Lt Col. and I'm not talking about Biden - I'm talking about military discipline - 93 upvotes
2,"No? Immoral or unethical behavior should always be questioned; since you mention UCMJ, I should tell you we are required to disobey unlawful orders and are supposed to question seemingly unethical actions are report them."
2,Yep.  That's how the military works.
2,He could have resigned his commission as an officer and flapped his gums all day with no worries or repercussions - he didn't and violated the law
2,"So you think the only reason this was added to the declaration of independence is because Jefferson was only justifying their actions? I think it was more so those that came after them would know what should be done and create a legal path todo so. I'm sure no lawyer but it seems to be more than justification but a warning to be prepared for future tyranny.

I definitely agree with the love it or leave it part tho. I think more than a few need to have their citizenship revoked and sent out of the country and some should be held accountable for their actions that have lead to our current situation."
1,"What happened to the military officers like Alexander Vindman who not only criticized Trump, he lied under oath for a phony impeachment? He filed a false whistle-blower complaint claiming he heard the Ukraine phone call. He didn't. An Obama holdover Eric Ciara-mella heard the call and used Alexander Vindman as a phony witness. No charges were  given to Vindman even after he was caught lying."
2,"I am in the military and nothing restricts my speech off of duty hours or out of uniform. 

For commissioned officers it is indeed different. My point is there‚Äôs a different between morals and laws. 

He was have been limited by law in technically, but morally he had an obligation to defend the honor and the lives of the service members serving under him. 

Countlessly the president and other high appointed officials, military and not do things that are blatantly against the UCMJ and against the law. Almost never do they face repercussions, and even very little do they receive scrutiny, that is as long as it sides with the left viewpoint that almost every corporation sector  and power house in this country supports."
2,The reality of Military service
1,"Correct.  What immoral or unethical order was Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller given, that he had a duty to disobey?

Contrary to leftist belief, *not liking* the President or senior officers does not grant military personnel carte blanche to disobey their lawful orders or act disrespectfully toward them."
2,So you can tell the difference between President and commanding officer?
1,"There is no legal path to overthrow the government.

There is a constitutional system to create laws, judge them and amend the constitution. You should know that as a ""constitutional conservative"".

You advocate something else it's called sedition or treason against our constitutional republic. They make tall trees and short prices of rope for them folks."
2,Then he should have resigned his commission and then complained - citizen presidents don't get court martials bc their not soldiers - who was the last president some country didn't want tried for war crimes - they don't get a fcking opinion - nor does a commissioned officer - period
2,The UCMJ and code of conduct clearly restricts speech of any enlisted or commissioned officer in the military.  You might need a crash course on military law.
2,"No, abandoning our people and actively arming a terrorists organization is plenty of ammunition to question what the hell is going on.  If you can‚Äôt even admit that point, I don‚Äôt see a reason in continuing this conversation."
2,"Yeah like the the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of a military department who are also covered and who I assume probably had something to do with the withdrawal - it's getting sad now"
2,Do you personally believe the current president and his administration have become a danger to America?
2,So your saying the declaration of independence is nothing but paper or our constitution?
2,"Go ahead and look up the hatch act and DOD Directive 1344.10. 

The UCMJ directly states commissioned officers."
1,"> No, abandoning our people and actively arming a terrorists organization is plenty of ammunition to question what the hell is going on.

It absolutely is.  However, those don't relate to orders Lt. Colonel Scheller was given.

His first video was a violation of Article 88 of the UCMJ.  His second video was a violation of that, and arguably Article 94 also, because it included the statement  ""Follow me, and we will bring the whole [expletive] system down"".  The possible penalties for violation of Article 88 are dismissal, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for one year.  Article 94 has the potential to carry a death penalty.

Biden and the senior officers under his command did a lot of bad things, and they should all spend time in prison.  ...but what Scheller did was dumb."
2,"The declaration of independence was a document explaining why British citizens were overthrowing their government and included specific examples of abuses by the king to justify why they were doing it to gather support from other British subjects living in the colonies and other European powers.

The Constitution was created to create a new constitutional republic to replace a failing confederacy of states. It includes a blue print for how this government should operate and how it can be changed through constitutional amendments. All states ratified this through a vote making it the new law of the land.

The bill of rights were added later through the amendment process established in the constitution because it was the law of the land. 

There is no, we declared independence so you can legally do it whenever you want clause.

Again, you want a revolution prepare to get bloody. And if that's you intention, quit pussy footing around, declare you rebellion and get to fighting"
2,"Well the only thing evil need to spread is for good men to do nothing. 

I would rather find peaceful legal solution. However I won't choose doing nothing while evil destroys our country and the American way of life. 
My family had fought in every war this nation has ever been in from the 1st to the last. I won't be the one to change that. While it scares the hell out of me, I won't comply with what my heart tells me is wrong."
2,"So when does your declaration of independence get released. 

The colonists had 27 abuses and usurpations by the king to justify their treason. Let's start with the abuses and usurpations you feel the Constitutional Republic has completed against you."

1,It's good to see President Sippy Cup finally getting tough on border control. /s
1,"Biden and Democrats want to believe their lies that everything went okay that they are going to leave Americans to die there. If they helped then it would be acknowledging they messed everything up. 

Democrats strategy appears to be just parrot the propaganda for months and hope people believe your shi$t doesn't stink if you do it long enough."
1,It's possible that all of this was intentional. What if the Americans left behind were Biden's enemies. Biden hands the Taliban their name and addresses and let's the Taliban do his dirty work for him. His enemies are dead. Problem solved. He will take a hit in the polls early on in his administration in the hopes that by 2024 it's all forgotten.
2,"But he said efforts to get people out would be ""ongoing""."
1,Two things Democrats are great at.. supporting death through abortion and abandonment.
1,"The Taliban is holding some outgoing flights for ransom so I would understand if this was a preventative measure, but considering it's the Biden administration, I'm sure that wouldn't be the reasoning."
2,"> Clay received word on Thursday that their flights out of Afghanistan would eventually receive approval following the State Department‚Äôs review of their manifest ‚Äî a task that could take several days even as just the initial 800 names are subjected to the vetting process.

You want 100% of the people in those planes to be vetted, right? If they were all US nationals, this would be different."
2,This clown didn‚Äôt kill enough Americans already?
2,"Now now, his policies are specific to certain countries and religions. It may sound hilariously ironic but remember, no mean tweets."
2,So you say you want a revolution....
1,"We do want them vetted. And that can be done while they are held at a more secure facility. Getting them out quickly is a good thing though. 

  We want them vetted like we wanted all of the people on Biden‚Äôs planes vetted that were not. We want them vetted like the people crossing his open border that are not."
1,"Not him. His puppet masters. He is the perfect fall guy. The people pulling the strings can take care of Biden's enemies. If caught, the people pulling the strings can blame Biden. He gave the order. If not caught, well it's all gravy."

1,so true. the USA should take note. ugh nvm we got Joe and the hoe running the circus.
0,"Sorry, but this data is completely made up.  Please check the government sites for Sweden and Israel for factual data.  Also, no country is currently on their 3rd shot of vaccine in other than critical care deployments.   This is just designed to rile people up and try to prove a point that isn‚Äôt supported by either measured fact or by critical reasoning.  Vaccines work.  Masks work.  Social distancing works.  The USA proved this was effective under both Trump and Biden.  Now we‚Äôre suffering again thanks to people spreading these lies.  Viruses mutate.  That‚Äôs why we get a different flu vaccine every year.  Covid mutated in the the more aggressive and dangerous Delta variant.  Now people with no defenses, folks who refuse to get vaccinated, are being hit hard.  This sucks and is completely avoidable.  How do I know this.  I‚Äôve got two doctors in my family, both working ICUs.  Both watching people suffer and die.  Direct observation of fact.  Please get vaccinated and end this.

Edit:  As I noted in a follow up comment below, I was looking at the unvaccinated occurrence of infection, not the overall country rate.  But this also bought up the key difference in vaccination between Sweden and Israel.  Sweden is far more vaccinated than Israel is.  Hence lower  Hence relaxation of mask and social distancing.  Vaccinate and wear masks to help protect the unvaccinated."
2,The county we live in has nearly 100% vax participation and the R-eff has been 0.9 for almost two weeks. Mask mandates still in place...
1,I took a lot of heat on arguing that mask mandates don‚Äôt work. They‚Äôre quite a hive
0," boosters just started so that‚Äôs not relevant. 

Look at Sweden‚Äôs vaccination rate. Additionally because mask mandates don‚Äôt exist doesn‚Äôt mean people aren‚Äôt wearing masks and distancing because they are.  Nordics take community efforts seriously and usually don‚Äôt need to be mandated to do the right thing."
2,"This is really true data, and it‚Äôs not a bad two groups to pit against each other, they are both relatively small countries that are mostly homogenous racially, and the only true difference is claimed it (and I do wonder if that has anything to do with it, the Middle East is‚Ä¶ Well, desert, and isn‚Äôt Sweden fairly cold?)"
1,Mask killed my mom it has no use they just recommend it to us so we vote dems
2,"I‚Äôm not antivaxx, but don‚Äôt give over 330 million people a vaccine until your positive it works. That‚Äôs just common sense"
2,you realize the population is only bigger by 1 million in swedes yet it‚Äôs 21x bigger?
1,I'm happy to be in the control group until human trials are over.
2,not to mention sweden is 21x bigger then israel with a slightly similar population
2,"Seems legit to me.  
[Sweden](

[Israel](  

From swedish government:  
  

  

55 in ICU in entire Sweden atm."
2,"Swede here. I live in Stockholm. Hopefully my tourism in this sub will be tolerated. 
 
Practically no one wears mask, if someone does it is almost always old people and they usually wear the good tightly fitted ones. Slightly more people wear on public transport, some put them on just when they travel. Walking in central stockholm, maybe 1 in 100 you see wear mask. Cashiers and working people are some times required to wear one. Mostly people stopped caring.  

[Here is Stockholm, July '21, 600 people [sound]]("
2,"Sweden is also over 10x larger with a significantly higher income population and a similar population size, most of their mandates that restricted public crowding and enforced social distancing were lifted in mid-July. In terms of vaccination, Sweden is at about 60%, and while climate can affect viral transmission, it is likely in large part to Sweden's much lower population density that we see these numbers"
1,Weren't Sturgis and the Trump rallies the superspreader events that didn't happen?
2,"The alternative to facts and knowledge isn‚Äôt OK when it comes to a subject, a very communicable disease in this case, that affects people in a community.  If it only affected an individual then do as you like regardless of observable fact and measurement."
0,"You are correct.  I was looking at unvaccinated case rates, not country wide case rates.  That was my mistake and I apologize for the error.  The statistic that‚Äôs missing here is the country wide vaccination rate.  Sweden is far ahead of Israel on that which is what‚Äôs driving their low case rate

Message stays the same.  Wear a mask.  Get Vaccinated.  If you‚Äôre sick, stay away from others.  This is basic healthcare stuff that we‚Äôve known about for several centuries."
1,"They were supposed to be, but it turns out the bigger the crowd of people that don't give a shit, the less reported cases there are. Anyone that got sick probably hung out at home and thought to themselves, "" well shit I'm sick "" then a few days later felt better just like 99% of everyone else that gets this.   They didn't go on national TV and talk about their positive test and how everyone should get vaccinated, so the news is not interested."

0,"What I don't understand and never will is this; if I am dying or at deaths door, what doesn't it matter if I wish or chose to take drug that is considered controversial that could possibly save me? Not just cause of covid, I felt this way before covid."
2,"We don't need more physicians, we fewer liars..."
2,">(of 12) 9 of these patients are now home, and the 10th is rapidly improving

isn't that what happens usually, anyway?

sounds like a job for a medical scientist with a background in statistics, to me"
2,"Doctors have a duty to do no harm, if you wanted lots of pain killers that could stop your breathing and kill you, there‚Äôs a limit to what they will give since they can‚Äôt practice what would be literal suicide at that point. Also there are laws. In the case of a doctor won‚Äôt intubate or use resuscitative measures if you have that signed along with other treatment modalities you can chose to refuse. Plus depending on the drug many have drug-drug interactions that could either enhance or decrease the current efficacy of medications you‚Äôre on based on its metabolism. Lastly it‚Äôs for prevention of law suits. Let‚Äôs say you ask for a bunch of random medication and survive yet have side effects that cause permanent damage or require surgery or other things, now you‚Äôll be suing the hospital. 

Lastly in the case of this tweets correlation doesn‚Äôt equal causation. Ivermectin is used to treat parasites. People are buying animal formulations and overdosing themselves, and the media is having a field day calling it medicine. Just like I‚Äôve seen people struggling financially use animal antibiotics and getting deathly sick or using insulin doses for pets. Covid is a virus. Viruses aren‚Äôt alive. Just like antibiotics which work on bacteria wouldn‚Äôt help in this case, neither would anti fungal medication. 

I also don‚Äôt understand why the people who adamantly argue that this virus is a hoax or man made or not that serious and won‚Äôt get vaccinated or wear a mask suddenly feel so scared of it that they have to take ivermectin.  

Next thing you know, covid patients are gonna be asking for chemo and radiation to kill everything in their body."
2,"Yes, the hypocrite oath. Yes, assisted suicide is for the most part illegal in the US. I am familiar with DNRs, I used to be a paramedic and worked in a trauma center. Also I am familiar with contraindications when I comes to medication, I was a line Medic in the Army. However, if I was in sound mind and sighed a liability waver or give power of attorney to a family member, thus relasing the attending physician of any and all legal liability prior to my contraction of ANY virus or illness, why not?  The virus is not a hoax but, my job allows me to view certain government materials. The last brief I read was that COVID spread was ""very unlikely"" to be spread naturally. ""More than likely"" leak out the lab, however not meant to be a bio agent. 

I do not believe any virus is a hoax, we have pictures of them. That was not my argument."
2,I mean I support the whole your body your choice thing. I‚Äôm only a 4th year medical student so I can‚Äôt speak from too much experience yet. I think if the person is willing to pay and like you said of sound mind and judgement and doesn‚Äôt hold anyone liable then by all means. But they shouldn‚Äôt then go and claim whatever worked for them as a miracle cure without further testing since there are many factors that go into play. And a sample size of 1 is meaningless.
2,"Much respect for being a med sudent!! We need more doctors in this country. You are a 4th year med student you can absolutely speak. Do not think you can not. I don't advocate for for treatments that work worked for me will work for others. I am a big dude. So my doses are usually higher. However, if look at dose to weight ratios you can see why people do things, without the understanding of rNA insulin vs. Synthetic."
2,Yea exactly and thanks I appreciate it. Always nice to have a civil discussion. I‚Äôm not a rebuplican or democrat and my views vary depending on the topic but I think we lack the critical thinking and decent these days

1,Tyt might be the most racist so called news ever. The Democrats are the founders and promoters of the kkk do they not know history?
2,"So this is what I worry about‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve followed TYT for years, but recently they made a very convenient edit to videos from Jimmy Dore, regarding alleged sexual harassment towards Ana Kasparian. As I stated before, I‚Äôm not a fan of jimmy Dore at all, but his comments were about Kasparian being unprofessional with her work attire, and framing it as a joke. What he said was, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a nice ‚Äúnews‚Äù skirt‚Äù‚Äî  They played a clip of Dore saying, (this is not verbatim) ‚Äúi made her feel terrible, and ashamed‚Ä¶ I did that‚Äù ‚Äî then the clip stops and Cenk calls him a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù. Right after the clip cuts off, Dore finishes his comment by explaining how terrible it was that he made her feel that way, and then he apologized. 
‚Äî‚Äî with that said, I‚Äôm voting for Newsom, don‚Äôt like Elder, but I‚Äôm very curious about what he said after the clip stopped, because it was very abrupt. Elder doesn‚Äôt seem like he is advocating for paying slave owners reparations. The point he seems to be making is that it was legal to have slaves, so if reparations were paid out, an argument could be made for the slave owners receiving reparations as well. He didn‚Äôt sound like he was advocating for that, but just making a point on reparations as a whole. If I were to make a guess, he was making an argument against reparations, not making a point that slave owners should be paid as well."

1,"Yes, Reparations. Taking money from people who never owned slaves and giving it to people who never were slaves. 
What about white americans from the north whose ancestor probably died fighting to free the slaves? Or black people today whose ancestor's owned slaves? Or what about mixed racial people - would a black person with a white slave owner ancestor have to pay? What about a white person with a black slave ancestor, would they receive money? 
The rabbit hole of reparations makes no sense and is widely open for abuse and perpetuating resentment that should have died decades ago. That's Elders point. You're either too stupid to understand that or are deliberately misrepresenting him so you can smear him."

1,"The young turks are missing Mr. elders point all together. Intentionally. Mr. Elder is pointing out the absurdities one encounters when going down the rabbit hole of reparations.

Elder opened my eyes on the matter. Made me contemplate some important questions and consider things I had not considered. 

Would Rachel dolezal get reparations? Would Oprah Winfrey? Obama? Kamala Harris? When today there are FAR more poverty stricken white people in America than any other people. Do all black people get reparations even though many NEVER had relatives who were enslaved? What about those black people whose families were actually slave OWNERS? There were many. Who pays these reparations? All white people? All citizens whether they had anything to do with the slave trade or not? Republican families who sacrificed their own flesh and blood to liberate the slaves and end the infamous traffic? People whose families never even lived in the country until maybe 100 years after the infamous traffic of slavery had ended? They owe, too? The South was home to 250,000 free blacks. Do their descendants get reparations, too? There were ~4000 black slave owners owning more than 20,000 slaves. How does that figure into ‚ÄúReparations‚Äù?¬†Since the country‚Äôs founding 306,000 slaves were brought here, but since slavery ended more than 2,000,000 black Africans have come here by choice... another 1,000,000 Black Americans came here by choice and by way of the Caribbean. how does THAT figure into reparations?

Because of Larry elder it now seems to me that the only proper way to handle the inequities of the past is to make sure that our laws are just TODAY. That they‚Äôre applied equally to every citizen. To continue to provide access to opportunity WITHOUT favoring or handicapping ANY racial group.¬†I think that‚Äôs the best we‚Äôve got."

Look at how easy its been and how we are playing nice while those animals are killing innocent people. The Taliban are the scum of the earth  ( . )     The only way its ends is to kill them all  &   You all know it. Animals go extinct all the time. What‚Äôs different now?

0,"It doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter if the Taliban is awful. Saudi Arabia is beyond awful, and you guys just gave them billions of dollars in weapons. Trump bragged about it being the biggest weapons deal in history. United States supports right-wing fascist dictators all over the planet right now as of this moment. No country on Earth has more blood on its hands than the United States."
2,I agree with Cenk üíØ%
2,Death to the Taliban
2,"The US didn't ""create"" the Taliban, the US and other nations funnelled money into Afghanistan to help the Mujahideen fight the Soviets, it's arrogant to say the US ""created"" the Taliban, tell it as it happened."
2,"He is actually saying that the President and other government officials have fled the country and now the country is back in the hands of Taliban. I did not hear him say ""don't worry"""
2,"This is what happens when you put literally Neanderthals weapons and power. Seriously though, take a screenshot of the cavemen in the back and take a screenshot of an actual rendering of a Neanderthal and put them together. Tell me these aren't literal cavemen!"
1,These so-called journalists in America should look at this and see what they are actually doing while these American journalist sit here and almost defend these people it's sickening to see what the news media and turned into they are the press for the Democrat Party there is no longer any biased news outlets
2,"Nice to see presenters actively disagree with each other on the video in a spontanious way. Immediately the honesty of the presenters shine through. With TYT, at least you can tell while they have an Ideological view that informs their reporting style. They're not actively trying to BS their audience."
2,Islam is the religion of peace.
2,"We allow women to go to school/ university but only with female proffesors.

No, because women were not allowed to go to school  previously."

2,"The US should stop f***ing around, the US acts like that all the countries in the world are some whores and it can f**k any one whenever it want. What the US did to Vietnam, Cambodia, Iraq, Syria, Libya etc , what it got from it??? üòÅ Running pants-less!!!! And now from Afghanistan.
 You should all be ashamed of yourselves. You aren't police of the world you are just another f***ing country that should mind its own business. It took you more than 200 years to get rights to your black people. Keep calm and let the natural process of change in other countries too.    You f***ing morons"
0,I've never heard anyone from NBC or CBS or even ABC say a word about loving war. Nor have I heard that on any other news channel. I don't what CONservative media so I don't know what they say about war. I think someone needs a vacation to unplug from the craziness for a while.
2,News Flash their terrorists and we armed them to the teeth!
2,Jenk is getting to the heart of the matter between positive punishment and negative punishment. The gun wielding psychos will positively put a bullet in your head if you don't do what they say the checkbook wielding psychos will negatively affect your bank account leaving you destitute and wishing that there was a bullet in your head.

0,"This will be the mainstream media if we let trump and his racist thugs Republicants get back into office.  Except their name will be called the ""Tali-KLAN""."
0,This is what is going to happen in the USA.  if we let Trump supporters take over the government.  Just take a look at their policies and it matches the taliban.

0,"Oh Ana, you open with a question that presupposes that religious zealots think rationally. Haven't you seen enough of the Christian Taliban here in the US to know better?"
2,"That‚Äôs pretty scary. 
What our news would have looked like if Rump had won."
2,"CENK! I admire you but the way you silenced Ana here was prettier horrendous. This was after all a section introduced and presented by her about the Taliban literally holding new media hostage in Afghanistan. You decided to steal the segment by turning it into an attack on your American media rivals. When Ana tried to respond to this you cut her off repeatedly and then said ""hold on"" which suggests you will allow her to respond at the end. But once you made your point you ended the section without allowing her any retort. 
The Taliban taking total control of the media is an important story but you dismissed it and silenced Ana voice by wagging your finger at her and then holding your hand up to silence her in a very dictatorial fashion. 
This came off terribly. I'm not saying this as some sort of fan of Ana, I actually think she too often doesn't do her due diligence before reporting on a story and it clearly shows but as a boss I would never raise my voice to literally drown out the voice of a female staff member while wagging my finger at her and then use the ""stop!"" hand gesture to silence them. You are meant to be a progressive.
I hope you read this as that was very dictatorial behaviour and is a nasty window into your workplace behaviour."
0,Saudi Arabia created the Taliban. And Bush helped them. And Trump owes MBS millions.
2,One should not be afraid of zealots intent on killing you?

0,"Oh my god.  I hope they weren‚Äôt Islamophobic and they used the right pronouns because that‚Äôs the main thing, right?"
2,"I can't imagine how effective this would be. 
The Afghans have eyeballs, and can see the actual chaos & destruction around them."

NEXT, HOW LOW DO YOU HAVE TO GO TO JUST GET YOUR FIFTEEN MINUTES OF FAME, GOING ON CNN AND BASHING THE BEST PRESIDENT THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER HAD.   BUNCH OF SORRY LOSERS IN LIFE.....GET A REAL JOB CHIEF"

2,Corrupt reporting of news is an even bigger problem.
2,This one police chief can't speak for all.  He's just as ignorant as ol' Walter.
2,those police mans must in federal court to sentence to death. think at those man who sentenced arnold schwarzenegger to death in california for killing womans. this persons - killers was policemans.  this is real life. law is law. if not sentence those mans to death this is crime against humanity with policians whos are in this affaire likewise in. what get a man if with this police chief after bankrobbing this do? from police mans? or from court? especially if this chief is inocent?
1,he's not even wearing a real badge but of course it's CNN so they couldn't find a real cop
1,"If this Police Chief cannot maintain control in his area, he needs to find another job. All his ass is doing is getting his 5 minutes of fame for badmouthing the President! Oh, from Houston...another Liberal city!"
2,"Unfortunately, this ...umm... ""police chief"" didn't understand that the Trump quote was directed at the govdrnors on the phone call.  Not at anybody else, and not at the police.  

But hey, you don't have to be a genius to be a  ""police chief"" when the staunchest ally of police that ever occupied the Whitehouse was the guy you are bad mouthing."
2,How nasty and dare that police chief is to disrespect president of united States?
2,if this guy run i will vote for him
2,"This turd box; coming from a Chief who had his department saluting a criminal as his casket went by and draped with an American Flag, as if this guy was in the military or Law Enforcement. Shame on him‚Ä¶ total disgrace!"
2,"Most of these big city ‚Äúchiefs‚Äù are political hacks, shuffled around from city to city as a de facto Federalization of local police forces. I‚Äôm glad to live where the chiefs are still pulled from the ranks."
0,"To the police chief... YOU'RE A MORON!!!!....You playcate the leftist radical, lawless agenda...From a family of veterans, including a fallen Navy Seal, your a ball less sheriff....And you most certainly don't speak for the majority of law enforcement...We all believe in love, but sometimes, especially now, love has to be tough...When the thugs in the streets are pillaging and accosting citizens, it ain't a hug that's gonna stop em....it's law enforcement that aren't afraid to do their job......"
1,Get all the trump supporters immediately it is serious we need to go to war
1,"Well to the police chief on behalf of me as one of the people if you would do less interviews on the news and more of your job maybe BLM wouldn't be ravaging the streets burning down communities! 
Ps 
I wonder where the police Chiefs and the police officers were when BLM storm the gates of suburban neighborhoods!

1,CNN IS TRASH üí©
2,"Wait till people figure that out and realize it wasnt trump lying, it was THEM"

2,A police chief talking to the president of the United States like that should be fired.
0,Trump needs to SHUT UP and not cause people to follow him on the bad side of law.  He needs to SHUT up.  People need to listen to themselves not someone whom causes trouble and insites riots and problems for police and people who do not want what he wants.
2,if this guy run i will vote for him
2,Police Chief Art Acevedo is the best leader and I am a big fan.
2,"Great police chief,  he 100% right."
2,A wise man. We all need 2 come together... We have become a divided nation!!!üò¢
2,"This man is one of the reasons I respect people who serve our country with honor and respect. I‚Äôm not just talking about people who wear the uniforms eitherüòí. Chief Acevedo made a good point where our problems lie. If you want things to change in your favor then you need to vote for it. Also, I know that this is old news but I really don‚Äôt understand why people always think violence is the answer. Look what this worldwide riot sparked from. Police brutality. I happen to respect the police department but when there is an officer who uses unnecessary force or worse goes against all protocol and what has been taught, then I lose that respect. Trump‚Äôs answer during this crazy situation was to ‚Äúdominate‚Äù. I was disappointed not just because of how he spoke to the governors but also that he decided to use force as a first solution. should never be a first solution, no matter the circumstances. Here‚Äôs why. First depending on who you‚Äôre picking a fight with and how many, they might beat you senseless. Second all you are doing is making yourself look like the bad guy which is okay if you‚Äôre trying to conquer someplace but not such a good a idea to do with your own nation. Finally we have a thing called diplomacy. Ever heard it? Been around since the Roman Imperial Era? It doesn‚Äôt just apply with political agendas, if you know the country then it applies just as well to the public. Talking things out isn‚Äôt a guarantee, especially in the ‚Äúfree country‚Äù, but in emergency situations it‚Äôs a better first option than sending the National Guard. Violence is always met with more violence."
2,What should people do when we are physically threatened by those who are not peaceful towards us?
2,"So proud of you Mr. Acevedo...1 because you were chief here in Austin, TX, where I reside, 2 because you are now chief in Houston, where I was born & raised, 3 because you are an Orgullo Latino, 4 because you are a big hearted human being & I can just go on & on...anyways. God bless u always, Mr. Acevedo üôèüèΩ"
0,Trump always likes to act like he's the best friend the police could ever ask for. It's very relieving to hear to this man to set him straight.
2,No cop they stepped into the danger willingly when they got hired leadership hmm stop whining an lead then
2,"What an ego maniac !!  Art Acevedo is NOT the designated spokesperson for ALL Police Chiefs in the USA !   He's a loudmouthed, Oatbreaking JOKE"

Since it is very important,  so every State Capital and national guard can stop the mad attacks from Trumpiests who are armed and dangerous. I pray Joe Biden and Kamila Harris take over White House in peace. But before that all who are protectors of state capitol and our democracy should remove these dangerous organizations asap. 
Please watch this:

It's a part of our national history that we brought slaves to America to work in the fields picking cotton. So we can't change what Americans were taught in school. History is history, like it or not. In my entire life I have never judged a man or woman by the color of their skin. I wasn't brought up that way. But we have to teach our children that it is wrong. People need all the information available to make their decisions on how the country is run. If you start banning books then the public is not getting all the available information and they are unable to make proper decisions."

  Hold on.ü§îWait a minute. ü§óIf you don‚Äôt acknowledge you‚Äôve done something wrong in the past, and you erase the evidence of the pain caused and don‚Äôt talk of it then there‚Äôs no reason to repent. Saved again and we get to keep the book."
2,Looks like the School Board members are racist.
2,I've heard it all now you are going to ban sesame Street you are going to ban Malala yousef's book the girl was shot in the head for trying to go to school and you were going to ban her book and even more ridiculous you are going to be in a book about Rosa Parks WTF you people do not deserve your jobs but it figures that the school board is all white so they want the all white his story to be the right history I think it's silly that they actually been those books.

2,Banning books on Rosa Parks and Malala? WTF is happening???? I feel like I am living in an alternate universe where idiots are everywhere!
2,Racism is alive and well in America.
2,Trumpism at its best . Makes you wonder why ?
2,Do they wish to go back to the inquisition banning and burning books?
2,"White America sounds exactly like post-WW2 Japan. They white-wash history so that people know nothing about the atrocities that committed during that time. In their version, Japanese are the victims of WW2 because of the nuclear bomb."
2,The USA is a joke
0,WHITE RACISM STRIKES AGAIN
0,If you hadn't been a racist POS and had you not been and done what it said.  What should be banned is every damn thing they teach. COLUMBUS  didn't discover AMERICA.  How can you discover something where there are people?
2,"Please allow all our children to learn a complete view of the true america. How can educated, great leaders be developed if they cannot understand stupidity when they see it? The next generation should have a more thorough understanding than the previous generations. Otherwise the sensors are doing a disservice to the future, of an otherwise great nation..."
0,"Simple, we need to seperate from these racist. We need to have our people teach our children. We need to not join the military and defend these racist fighting the wars they start. We need to completely separate. And if these racist start something, we end it without showing mercy! Banning books on actual, factual history is the beginning. These racist are unquenchable, they will never stop! They never did and never will.."
2,"This is not a battle if ideologies. The deputized book burners are what stands in the way of a progressives entering congress and the white house. Without the book burners who is going to vote for trump. trump is just the John Gotti of Billionaires (he salivates in the spotlight) but everything he truly stands for the ultra rich families back 100%. How else could book burners have so much resources. Google CRT and the first 3 page results are dominated by anti CRT articles. How could they enter candidates for every political and civic office in the country, from small districts to the presidency, sheriff, District Attorney, SCHOOL BOARDS. Parents who like there history honest just set some time aside to learn together with your kids, I recommend the story of Jim Thorpe or the 1936 Berlin with the articles or documentaries that include Jesse Owens African American team mates that won medals of their own and their experience back home."
0,"*There's nothing free or Constitutional about trump or the entire Republicon party!*  Pelosi better not trust the 2 on the Jan 6th investigation, they can't ever be trusted!

What a bunch of lying hypocrites they are. They are doing what  trump accused China of doing to the Uighurs, creating re-education camps and forcing it on the blacks! 

Women in China's ""re-education"" camps for Uighurs have been systematically raped, sexually abused, and tortured. The republicans working in every area in this dysfunctional legal system have been doing the latter for many, many years!

The Hispanics are afraid to say boo and draw attention to themselves, or they'll be the next to go.

*""HIDDEN FIGURES WAS A FABULOUS MOVIE!""*"
2,Vote that board out!!
2,They keep saying they dont want their children to feel guilty of something that happen years ago how  do they think the children of color feel being taught white washed history to protect their precious little white children Really
2,YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO KNOW THE TRUTH..THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT AMERICA AND THE HISTORY ABOUT IT...CHILDREN NEVER GIVE UP..THAT'S WHY CHILDREN ARE SO BEAUTIFUL..JESUS
2,"Were these books poorly written? Grammer incorrect?  Not labeled as fiction, fantasy, educational correctly? They are books leave them in the libraries. History looks to be repeating itself in the states... lol. Fundamentalists are coming for you.... unvaxx'd even..."
2,This is were states rights gets really annoying. Federalize the truth and be done.
2,"Are you joking‚Ä¶.. this place is so backwards it‚Äôs ASTOUNDING. Honestly flabbergasted  still when I see these  kinds of stories. Teaching culture and history apparently is gonna be up to parents for awhile longer. Too bad half of us are racist morons with hard ons for power and freebies ,with zero contribution to the whole ‚Äús wellbeing."
2,If your parents are racists.... then you should be embarrased
2,"These are the same people whose ancestors tried to keep black people from learning how to read, the irony, history repeating itself"
1,Totally brainwashing leftist propaganda & wokeness to kids & young teenagers ü§¢

2,"This raises even more questions, like why do we have white flight whenever too many blacks move into the neighborhood? Black Americans are the living evidence of what happened yesterday, and the lingering effects of slavery and Jim Crow continues to beg for a discussion. Running away won't help the matter any."
0,"Of course they support it-they enabled the first one!  The GOP is completely corrupt, toxic & Trump enablers."
2,There wasn't many people there at least this time. Capital police also learned their lesson and fortified the capital. I will never understand why they didn't fortify it last time.
2,"Brianna, it's not that he doesn't CARE if he incites violence. He WANTS to incite violence. Why can't you seem to grasp that?"
0,"Dear: Republican Party

¬† When it came time to protect America you refused when the Alt-Right and the Neo-Nazis came you kept the door open for them. 

When Trump back these hate groups you protected him, a P.R. statement saying you refuse to support racism, then back Trump's hatemongering declarations the very next day. 

Who are you people to accept racism as a political platform? When David Duke supports Trump you did nothing, just give me my Tax Cuts and my Judges Mr. Trump.¬† 

African Americans are being attacked on the streets by Americans for, cooking, sleeping, shopping by Trump Supporters you could care less. 

When Trump broke the law dealing with Russia you protected him again. 

¬† Meanwhile, the hate groups are getting stronger, Anti-Governments Groups increase, but you Republicans do nothing. 

I say this as an independent voter you have permitted Donald Trump to become an American Dictator to keep your power. 

He Attacked Black Lives Matter for his supremacist racist base, for a Photo Op. 
The Republicans did nothing, Terrorist attacked Michigan's Capital you did nothing to stop Trump. 
Trump told the Proud Boys, I'm with you 
The Republicans did nothing. 
The Capital Has Been Attacked and you have settled back and have allowed Donald Trump and his followers to commit treason.¬† 

I say this to you honestly all of you are cowards to the Ameican People. It might not feel that way with the backing of Right-Wing Media, The Power and Money you have gained. 

We all saw it though, time after time watching you allowing Trump to do anything he wanted. 

A police officer has died and yes every one of you Republicans is to blame for his death, Fox News can't help you spin out of this. 

There is no honor, no integrity, or compassion within your party. 

Why do you ignore white supremacy and their organizations? 

Time won't heal this one, you have shown us who you are and we will never forget. 

Never Forget.

Where‚Äôs the prisons holding BLM vandals in solitary confinement and denying them basic legal rights?

1,I'm tired of it all put these fools in jail
2,China is asshoe
2,"maybe on the other side, china reports sleepy joe is the worse president in this term"
1,Biden doing the same thing
1,"Newsmax TV, the most war mongering propagandist news source available."
2,"I've been an American citizen for 26 years. During this time I've been following Russian and American news. I understand two perspectives. Americans aren't being told the truth neither about Russia nor China. In fact, with respect to both, Americans are constantly told lies, especially about China. When Trump was saying let's make friends with Russia, I began to think that Trump really wants to free America from the control of the Deep State because making any deals with Russia is what the Deep State doesn't want, be they Neocons or Democrats. Trump acted like Democrats were preventing him from making friends with or even talking to Putin or having a negotiation, meanwhile he imposed sanctions after sanctions against Russia. Then, at the end of Trump's term, he truly waged a massive anti-China information campaign, similar to the one Reagan waged against the USSR. What this tells me is that Trump wanted to fool everyone that he is a nice guy who wants to make friends with Russia and others. This tells me that he is still down with the people who are interested in regime changes in Russia and China and are not interested in negotiations, which means that Trump isn't any better than Bush, Obama, Clinton, etc. He almost fooled me. I thought that Trump was against the DS, but he was with the Neocons. If he wasn't with the Neocons, then he was surrounded by them, which means that he just couldn't really do anything from the get go and he wasn't in control of anything. They only allowed him to do certain things and said no to everything else. It is a 2-party 1-party system and the president is just a puppet, whether it is Trump, Biden, Obama, or Santa Claus."
0,First we must remove China Joe from office or we will be done with free America
2,I'd take Pompeo for President.
1,"President Trump called him to release the email, and he didn‚Äôt. Now he stated to talk about them."
1,"Hillary Clinton to Trump: ""I cant wait to see you in prison.""  Trump Answers: "" I don't think they will allow you visitors."""
2,If Trump runs and wins in 2024 he needs to go scorched earth on every Dem and corrupt Rep in office.  We all understand you have limitations on your first term and that the second term is the time you get to pull all the punches.  Which is why the Dems were shitting their pants and which is why they used the Media to hide their illegal activities and corruption.
2,Hilary Clinton's emails are not on state.gov i was just on the website and see nothing even close.

2,How much money did Pompeo and Trump siphon off the billion dollar Saudi arms deal?. Some estimates have Trump making $160 million on that deal and $440 on his there presidencial scams. They√± law will follow the money and find everything in time. Trump is in court the rest of his life.

1,"They are forcing good, strong, humble people like this man to choose between standing and kneeling. They‚Äôre goal is to make us stand, so we can be eradicated. They want only the sheep to be left. I say we give them what they want."
2,Thank You for your service and for your bravery in facing this outrageous mandate. Biden is out of control. They are not mandating the people at the borders . a bunch of hypocrites
2,They are just sorting whose loyal to the party or not.
1,"Resigning doesn‚Äôt help hurt them, though. Make them fire you and then sue their butts!"
2,All hail our new fascist government.
2,Why would anyone take a experimental ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù for a virus that has  99% + survival rate?
2,Tank you and god  is here‚Ä¶you fight for all fathers‚Ä¶
1,Adolph Biden.
2,"Ainsley sounds like a good hearted patriot, too bad she works for a corporation that forces their employees to get the jab!"
1,"This is a brave, humble true man.
He is gutted you can hear in his voice, because ppl are frightened of a flu infection.
It is ALL about power and control"
1,"So they're not really ""Blue Lives"" if you can decide to just quit one day."
2,Vaccines have always been mandated for the military and schools for as long as I remember. Same in hospitals and the medical field for certain vaccines. I had to get the Hep B vaccine to work in Trauma.
2,We will stand against tyranny this is one way to defund the police and all first responders just like the Jackass party they want this country to be weak amd broken thank you sir for standup sad you have to give up your job
0,"We are armed and have supplies. 

When the police and military quit over this.....

Who is going to provide security??

Waiting patiently for the invasion to happen"
2,To go along with evil just to keep your job shows what god this world serves. Its eye opening when you see and realize how people go along to get along.  Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act. Remember this was all designed to do what its doing and its working perfectly. God bless this man for his faith in the Almighty.
2,Buck Fiden!

1,Biden setting the stage for country to be invaded by foreign UN sponsored military by having our military quit.   He should be removed from office
1,All these idiots that are putting these untested drugs in their bodies are going to regret it.
1,"Even if ur not religious, u hafta respect this man‚Äôs strength of character and principles. He‚Äôs made quite a large sacrifice, n my estimation, to stand up for what he believes n. And that n and of itself is worthy of respect."
1,"This is how they remove people that MAY be conservative or republican from their jobs because let‚Äôs face it it‚Äôs the opinion of the leftists and dems that only trump supporters and republicans are against this vaccine which really isn‚Äôt true, people across the board are against the vaccine mandate not necessarily the vaccine. I‚Äôm a part time Uber and Lyft driver and today while working I met a woman who lost some of her sight and became partially paralyzed a couple days after taking the second dose of the vaccine and her doctor admitted it was almost certainly from the vaccine but these doctors aren‚Äôt reporting these cases so there really is legitimacy to peoples concerns about this vaccine and the government and businesses shouldn‚Äôt be putting mandates in place that essentially force people to get vaccinated or lose their jobs."
2,We live in a communist country
1,"what if they say no more pension without ""vaccination""?"

0,"Great, let's just wreck our military now.  The cops wrecked themselves a long time ago by being tyrants."
1,"They are pushing the best out of the military and police department.  
Biden should be arrested for treason , I 100% believe he and CONGRESS LEFT AND RIGHT are willfully causing this country to collaps.  

Our best pilots are quiting , Navy seals and other people who are red blooded Americans ....

This nation is in danger ."
2,When you lose your best and brightest only bad stuff can happen. And this is just what the left wants well I guess there really is going to have to be community policing neighbors protecting neighbors from Biden supporters
1,This man is my hero! I too will not get the vax! I support him 100%!
1,"As much as I applaud these polices officers and military personnel, and support them fully, it scares me that more and more are quitting. Soon we will have nothing but leftist snowflakes left in law enforcement and our military."
1,Understood and I applaud him but he served 30 years and is more than able to walk away with his pension. A lot of younger police officers can‚Äôt do this and it sucks.
1,Our jobs are like our family are people at our jobs we love the people at our jobs we love their families we love their children we interact with people children we don't want to see people suffer for something that's that's could have been handled earlier everybody blaming everybody this is not Trump for we love Trump do not blame this on Trump I'm not having it no one I mean no one will blame this mess up Joe did on Trump we love Trump we love Trump

1,"Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.  c.s. lewis"
2,"This mandate won‚Äôt last long. When city employees start leaving and no one fills that void, things will only get worse. When restaurants start to close, this‚Äôll go away. Good on this man and all of the others that stood up for what‚Äôs is right."
2,"Find out what Luc Montagnier, the man that discovered the HIV virus, says about this vaccine! He is one of the most brilliant minds we have and they won‚Äôt publish what he says because they don‚Äôt want us to know the truth!!!"
2,"Everyone is missing the entire point.
The tyrants want all the free thinking, freedom minded cops and military to quit.
That way when the tyrants turn the police and military against citizens; they will have only ones that will follow orders."
2,This is what I think when I see this video. Look at how these vaccine mandates are weakening our military and police force. Doesn‚Äôt it make you wonder maybe it‚Äôs being done on purpose?
2,GOD BLESS THIS MAN!!! HE WILL PREVAIL!!!! THIS IS LUNACY!!!!
1,This is a national emergency and in your heart is so big and your heart is so beautiful that you're not putting money before your job like so many others are doing and putting others at risk God bless you and thank you for saving me thank you for saving me if nobody appreciate you I love you and thank you for saving me sir

2,"Trickle-down ecomonic policy fails a shift in market (computer automation).
Automation dominates production and unstoppable.
Jobs are considered waste with automation, targets for removal.
Market doesn't create jobs like before, why taxes should be raised to pay for new jobs and infrustructure.
Trickle-down ignores that critical effect of computer automation, fuels inflation to give a boost to job loss from automation.
No compelling reason for citizens to pay for automation job-recovery with inflation when it's good times for market(automation).
Automation is good thing, saves time and gains more value than gold.

We allow politicians to invest in automation, they gain more despite job loss so it goes ignored.
Adding the 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution would fix it, end corruptton and trickle-down policy.
Wolf-Pac helps."
