Are you ready for a radical statement? I happen to think that Joe Manchin is right. Yeah, physical infrastructure is terribly important. But I happen to think that the needs of the human beings of our country — working families, the children, the elderly, the poor — are even more important, and we can and must do both.
Look, everybody in America — whether you're Republican, Democrat or independent — understands that, for the last many years, the very richest people in this country and the largest corporations have done phenomenally well, while the working class and the middle class of this country struggle, and we have got close to 600,000 people sleeping out on the streets.

Elderly people in America can't afford to put dentures into their mouth. They have no teeth in their mouth in some cases, can't afford hearing aids, can't afford eyeglasses. Working families cannot afford child care for their kids. Young people cannot afford to go to college.

And then on top of all of that, the scientific community is telling us that we're looking at a cataclysmic crisis in terms of climate. Oregon is burning. California is burning.

People are drowning in New York City. Detroit is flooding. Siberia has seen the largest fire on Earth. Drought is happening in places all over the world.

The United States must lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel. This is a crisis we are living in.

So, what polling tells us is that working families all over this country understand that NOW is the time for Congress to address the long neglected problems facing working families. Now is the time to have the wealthy and large corporations -- we've got billionaires in this country who don't pay a nickel in federal income tax.
So, I think we can do all of this. We can do the physical infrastructure.
We can do the reconciliation bill, create millions of good jobs, and finally tell the American people that we are going to stand up for working families — not just the rich and the powerful. Let's get it done.

Reminder: The actual cost of the Build Back Better Act is not $3.5 trillion, it's $0. The funding working families need is going to be paid for by taxing the wealthiest and corporations."

And will they go back down when supplies have returned to pre Covid prices?
My guess, nope."

2.0,"Bernie ur great, but u been saying the same stuff for years, & nothing been done.

So here's a NEW IDEA.
Can u & ur colleagues start referring to health insurance has a SOCIALIST CONCEPT, and belongs in a SOCIALIST MODEL.

Just saying it's a human right is fine, but that doesn't move the needle to much. U have to get ppl to see the logic, and change their minds. And u can do that better, by exposing the health insurance companies by doing the messaging this way.

How do health insurance companies make money?

They collect premiums r deny ppl coverage. THAT'S IT! And if u think about that, what is that, that's a SOCIALIST CONCEPT. If the CEO of XYZ insurance company is not happy making $5 million a year, they want to make 50 millon a year, what do they have to do, r the only thing they can do, is raise PREMIUMS r DENY ppl coverage. THAT'S IT. That's a socialist CONCEPT & belongs in a socialist MODEL. If u put a SOCIALIST concept into a CAPITALIST model, it will butt heads. It will not be as efficient r effective. And that's what we have now. And vice verse, u don't want a CAPITALIST concept in a SOCIALIST model. Otherwise, we'll all be waiting hours in line for stale bread. It's not like the CEO of walmart, if they want to make more money, they have to sell more, r be more efficient in their operations.Thus
, CAPITALIST CONCEPT, belongs in CAPITALIST MODEL. Same goes for health insurance companies. It's a SOCIALIST CONCEPT, & belongs in a SOCIALIST MODEL. Bcuz all they can do to make more money is raise premiums & deny ppl coverage. And that puts the squeeze on patients & doctors.

If u do the messaging this way, this will move the needle more to universal health insurance, bcuz ppl will see the truth & logic. Instead of just saying it's a human right, which it is, but to get more ppl to believe in universal health insurance, u need to do the messaging this way. A socialist CONCEPT belongs in a socialist MODEL. At minimum it should be non-profit.

I have some good ideas how to make to get this point across. And I'm sure, if u start this messaging, it will get done. Start beating the Republicans at their own game."

2.0,"I'm Swedish, but if I had been American I would have fought hard for improving the health care system in the US, the richest country in the world. Sure, many people think of Sweden as a communist hellhole (we're not a communist country, we have a social democratic government, labour party), and we DO pay higher taxes compared to many other countries (but not a 60 % flat rate income tax, a lot of people are convinced we pay that). Anyway, the taxes are spent on health care among other things. Insulin is free, no cost for the patient at all.

Yes, I'm very aware you can't compare the US to Sweden. We're a small country with a different system. But if anyone is going to change the system, it's Bernie. He would be a kick-*ss president.

There needs to be a elite that financially can take the Pharmaceutical Companies on.

2.0,"What I don't get is how the corporation gets sole ownership of the patent if the American citizens are paying for the research and development of many of these drugs.

First, that sounds 100% like an administrative failure. Drug companies don't just get this research funding out of thin air. They negotiate with the government for them. Exactly like with the Covid vaccines. That deal has been outstanding for the American people. Could you imagine if everyone had to buy our vaccines out of pocket or through insurance? We probably wouldn't have 25% of Americans vaccinated, and they'd be coming from Europe.

I would laugh in the face of a drug co CEO if he came to me with a bullshit deal like what we have been getting. I would feel like he was spitting in my face. I would kick them out of the White House and call his biggest competitor asking if they would like to be the first drug company to release xyz drug? Yeah? Great, but if Americans are paying for the research we get royalties on sales which will go to help fund future medical research, and there will be cap limits on American patients, with lower caps for the elderly and veterans. We would get that drug developed and CEOs would seriously think twice about going to the White House thinking that they are going to scam the American people."

TooFarLeft
Education is a good investment from an individual, family, community or national perspective and tuition free education will reduce the burden from the root on our medical expenses too for example.

Healthcare for all is actually CHEAPER with the insurance industry off of the table along with most of the time lost due to billing among many other reasons.

A universal basic income (UBI) is CHEAPER than all of the thousands of individual federal, state and local social safety net programs including things like Social Security and unemployment insurance, etc with all of their budgets, overhead expenses and inefficiencies eliminating the humiliating need for people to lose time to prove their poverty to qualify for aid.

Internet for all is a great and necessary investment to give everyone the opportunity to study, search for work, work remotely, etc online.

Solar power is CHEAPER and electric vehicles are soon to be CHEAPER to make and already are considerably CHEAPER to maintain and operate, especially if charged from your own solar power.

What do you think will happen to crime rates, peace and equality in general after we launch universal healthcare, a universal basic income, universal education and internet for all, raising the starting point of capitalism from zero, we’ll let you die with no money, to a level of life with dignity, reducing societal daily fears on a massive scale and freeing us to welcome the automation revolution with open arms rather than with fear and great harm? 😃 EqualityMovemen

Depriving the manufacturers of their intellectual property, investment return, worthwhile risk, and return on costly research. Often times forcing those companies to sell drugs below cost rather than being put out of business. The US couldn’t care less about protecting innovations and intellectual property abroad so those companies have to make a profit somewhere. That all being said, you are highly full of 💩 as usual not sharing free and substantially lower prices that your followers could receive (yes, WITHOUT insurance). I wonder how much innovation in medicine we’d have if we didn’t have incentives for companies to make new medical progress. I sure bet a socially managed drug world would stifle the advancement that these companies do and create. Focus on stopping your comrades in other countries and the white house from stealing from innovators and make them all pay their fair share. Why is there never any substance, background or solutions that exist that you can share? Greed my ass. Explain the dynamics and why what happens does. Hint: drug companies need to turn a profit and take on tremendous amounts of risk, failure, and loss. Protect American companies from getting robbed by socialist country extortion artists, defend intellectual property, and the prices will come down. You have such a presence and platform that could be used for good. All you do is fear monger instead of providing existing solutions and support for innovation. Socialist America is its own worst enemy. I wonder how many people you kill each year by convincing them it’s hopeless when there are options for them to get their medications for next to nothing or free."

I commend the Palm Springs City Council for going further than almost every other city, even the most progressive, in enacting both a vaccine and a mask mandate. Even San Francisco and New York have only mandated one or the other.

The city should now mandate medical grade masks, since cloth masks are virtually useless. In fact, they should unilaterally re-enact Newsom’s old color coded system, and require strict capacity limitations and masking outdoors. We need at least a 50% capacity restriction, plus a mask mandate, plus a vaccine mandate to control the virus now. And leave more restrictions options on the table if people just won’t behave.

‘Reasonable people can disagree about when a zygote becomes a ""human life"" - that's a philosophical question. However, regardless of whether or not one believes a fetus is ethically equivalent to an adult, it doesn't obligate a mother to sacrifice her body autonomy for another, innocent or not.

Body autonomy is a critical component of the right to privacy protected by the Constitution, as decided in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), McFall v. Shimp (1978), and of course Roe v. Wade (1973). Consider a scenario where you are a perfect bone marrow match for a child with severe aplastic anemia; no other person on earth is a close enough match to save the child's life, and the child will certainly die without a bone marrow transplant from you. If you decided that you did not want to donate your marrow to save the child, for whatever reason, the state cannot demand the use of any part of your body for something to which you do not consent. It doesn't matter if the procedure required to complete the donation is trivial, or if the rationale for refusing is flimsy and arbitrary, or if the procedure is the only hope the child has to survive, or if the child is a genius or a saint or anything else - the decision to donate must be voluntary to be constitutional.
This right is even extended to a person's body after they die; if they did not voluntarily commit to donate their organs while alive, their organs cannot be harvested after death, regardless of how useless those organs are to the deceased or many lives they would save. That's the law.

Use of a woman's uterus to save a life is no different from use of her bone marrow to save a life - it must be offered voluntarily. By all means, profess your belief that providing one's uterus to save the child is morally just, and refusing is morally wrong. That is a defensible philosophical position, regardless of who agrees and who disagrees. But legally, it must be the woman's choice to carry out the pregnancy. She may choose to carry the baby to term. She may choose not to. Either decision could be made for all the right reasons, all the wrong reasons, or anything in between. But it must be her choice, and protecting the right of body autonomy means the law is on her side. Supporting that precedent is what being pro-choice means.’” ~ from a friend"

Fine for going to the protest or disobeying rules is $5000 dollars!!

1.0,"Fact of the matter....peopl
e don't wear masks when they eat. Having this type of event in NAP with a high rate of COVID is typically Democratic poor optics and she doesn't care. She is the most powerful person in DC...more powerful than the President, and is in Napa to raise money for the Dems and preserve that woeful Gavin Newsome's governorship. Politics, power, and money are far more important to her...witness what she has or has not done for the people of CA in her time in Congress....and
the Dems continue to elect her......pitifu

0.0,"Some of your facts are wrong, example only half of Australia is in Lockdown . Sydney NSW , and Melbourne VIC , the rest of the states ( 4 ) are open fully with no restrictions. The other facts are correct, but not explained fully. The man who sneezed in the lift has covid but will not isolate , he wasnts to spread covid to others that's why the Police are looking for him.
Religious services are banned because of lockdown rules , you can only zoom your services. This minister broke the rules knowingly and got caught. Yes the lockdown is over the top , only because of the low vaccine rate in the beginning, now the rates have increased dramatically . Enjoy your show from down under , Sydney, Australia .👍"

2.0,Tucker Carlson Tonight I am Australian and the horse lady made me laugh for a bit then you got to the very real segments about Australia and I cried at how accurately wrong we are being treated it’s an absolute disgrace and so disheartening. Many here are just getting on with their lives whilst our fellow Australians just across the Queensland border into New South Wales are being treated like leapers. I am afraid for our children’s futures 😢
2.0,Don’t worry about the police beating you with batons... they just want you to stay healthy. 🙄
2.0,I'm surprised you did not mention the forced v🪓ination of children. They physically ripped children from their parents' arms and v🪓inated them.

2.0,Oh god. This is too sad. As a New Zealander with friends and family in Australia hearing what a compliant community we are makes me realize just how we would have behaved in Nazi Germany.
2.0,We should have done this last summer when all the rioting and looting was going on. Our us police in every state should have been allowed to use the same kind of force.

No Tucker, this is NOT the Australia you know, and whose Army Engineers’ uniform I once wore with pride.

It’s now home to the socialist thugs running roughshod over the people. You’re right about one thing; Victorian, Queensland and Western Australian voters have recently voted them back in.

It’s unbelievable and, IF I could afford it, and IF I could leave (yes, locked in, locked up and locked down), I’d emigrate."
2.0,This kind of crap has been out there since the beginning the problem is people will not listen people will not take charge of thier own choices own life

1.0,"What about the next mandate? Do you really believe, after seeing this and Obamas birthday party, that these people are getting the vaccine? Or is it all for show so the masses are mandated? Vaccine is not mandated for the White House or Phizer employees."

1.0,"Im in Queensland, Australia.
Certain States have different rules, Victoria is the most totalitarian, New south wales is a bit better, but stil mandating masks and forced vaccinations, but the other 4 states and 2 territories aren't in lock down.
There may be a 3 day lock down here and there if there are 30 ish cases, but it depends on how much of a Dictator the state health officer is"
2.0,Well we must love hypocrisy today. Because a lot of it is taking place right now and it seems like no one cares
2.0,The media here plays scenes of people at these rallies calling them selfish with the evil foreboding music in the background and then switch to hopeful uplifting music when showing people in line to get vaccinated calling them heroes.
2.0,"More Mandates are coming. If they can legally fire someone for not wanting to take the vaccine. Once they declare Global warming a crisis. Your travel will be greatly restricted.
Anyone in politics... regardless the political party they belong too. Should immediately be voted out of office. Sad to say... but for the most part. All of us on here are a systemic part of the problem. We get riled up but quickly calm down. Myself included."
2.0,We need to stand together & stand up for our rights!!
1.0,Who’s going to print the T-shirt’s “I’m a dangerous slacker cause a won’t wear a mask so shoot me” cause I will wear one. Totally not tasteful but the whole thing is beyond absurd and most Americans are beyond fed up and that also speaking up in defense also of this heinous crime too. The world has gone insane and it’s time to stand up!
1.0,"The only reason why I wear a mask, is because I can't afford the $200 ticket the police will give me here in Israel. It's horrible."
1.0,Shocking but so happy Tucker is speaking out!!! I hope ALL Americans watch this!!!
1.0,"I have great respect Tucker, and by no means agree with mask mandate. But they are at a table, outside, fixing to eat. Now how do you eat a 30k meal with a mask on. Even Republicans take them off to eat.
This is getting attention for silly reasons."
1.0,I can’t with all this. We are going to start killing dogs now because of covid. Society is sick.

2.0,"Not all Aussies are taking this lying down. Hence why there were thousands in Melbourne, lots in Queensland (who the police could only standby and watch because they were not in lockdown), and in Sydney.

1.0,"I can’t believe what I’m looking at. How can people accept being treated like prisoners being herded by thugs in uniform……… all because of a bloody mask.
It is really sinister watching this. And listening to that New Zealand nut warning people not to talk to their neighbors. This has to stop while we can still stop it."
1.0,"Tucker Carlson Tonight, you’re not completely correct in your Australian report. Not all of Australia is under Marshall law, just New South Wales and I think Victoria. Queensland is at this point still reasonably free, but it won’t take much for us to go under either. Interstate travel is near impossible though."
1.0,The Delta variant is completely undetectable. There is no PCR test or rapid test that can pick up on the Delta variant. The only thing they can believe is that fear is going to drive people to believe that this is a powerful virus. The Delta variant is a weak mutation
2.0,"What doesn’t amaze me is that you have a very big crowd that can easily overpower the officers arresting just one individual, but instead of helping they would rather record and just feel like they are doing something “important”. That… is selfish and ignorant… no, sorry, that’s selfish and stupid. My opinion of course."

2.0,The world has gone mad!!!! So many people just don't see it. Governments certainly have hidden agendas!
2.0,"As much as I appreciate the service that our law enforcement provides to our communities, I also know that at any given moment they can turn their backs on me. Not only did we see this happening in several blue states, but now we are seeing it in Canada, New Zealand and now in Australia. If people continue giving these authoritarian politicians more power, and later realized their mistake, by then it will be too late."
2.0,Wow what BS from Australia. They do not want people talking to each other to expose the lies that are being perpetrated on people.
2.0,"We've seen what the ""elite""/

2.0,"I have a theory that those people freak out so much about that crap because they've lived such shityy lives like stealing from their constituents, their nations and all around being degenerates that they are almost certain they are going to hell so they are doing literally anything to stay alive. Also take notice that their police and I'm sure ours in America will have absolutely zero issue with just following their orders."
2.0,It's so sad to see that Australians are now facing pure totalitarian fascism! I lived in Australia - Adelaide - in 2000-2001 and I enjoyed the relaxed freedom of Australians then. This is politics turned amok!
0.0,Tucker Carlson will you be leaving Fox now that they are requiring vaccines for all staff? It seems the hypocrisy is t just in Washington if you stay.
2.0,"Feudalism is the society they want to bring back.
""he dominant social system in medieval Europe, in which the nobility held lands from the Crown in exchange for military service, and vassals were in turn tenants of the nobles, while the peasants (villeins or serfs) were obliged to live on their lord's land and give him homage, labor, and a share of the produce, notionally in exchange for military protection."""
0.0,Friggin hypocrites. This is unacceptable. Why isn't something being done about it. Gutless Republicans need to show this video in Congress.

1.0,"This is the Democratic Party. Dangerous and hypocritical. Preaching we must all wear face diapers, while they go unmasked. People are hopefully waking up to the insanity!"
1.0,Good for thee but not for me. They are only mandating masks to turn us against each other. This happened to me yesterday at the Vet office where I was viscously verbally attacked by a woman and told to put on a mask. I was unprepared for this attack as everyplace is really left to your own discretion in our city right now. The only thing I could muster was I don’t do masks. She sat on the other side of the room videoing me and the whole waiting room and will probably put it on social-media. -I really don't care. Picking on a 100 pound grandma wearing a huge back brace from my recent surgery is how you’ll recognize me. I work on my health everyday of my life as I have autoimmune and back issues. I have felt great for the past 8 years and even more since this recent surgery. She needs to take a look in the mirror at what appeared to me to be a very overweight unhealthy individual and worry about herself. PS I still have the antibodies from Covid that I got while in the Holocaust museum filled with Chinese students here on their winter break before any of us had even heard of it. I was very ill for 10 days. PS- I LIVED!
1.0,"Tucker, our leader (the lady with the teeth🤣)

0.0,Good thing Australia already disarmed all there citizens.. lolz
0.0,"Just scary times. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻. Vaccinated and unvaccinated can still spread covid.
Forced vaccinations will hurt some. Medical exemptions have always been there for a reason. Common sense. Your doctor should help you decide this with informed consent. Some people think they are more important then others. No one deserves to die from covid. Access to antibody treatment should be available to everyone. It is humanity. No one is more important then another. I’m sad seeing this happen. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻💔. If anaphylaxis with first covid shot or obtain GBs or causes a stroke from blood clots. The injured then aren’t allowed in public places????? Because couldn’t get their card. Instantly. The weak physically are told it’s best for them to protect them. Scary. You stay home. Why I go out because I’m stronger physically then you. While they still spread the disease. It’s heartbreaking. 💔
If your vaccinated with a “cold”. It can still be covid and you can still spread it.
Need to enforce SICk POLICIES regardless of vaccination status. Not just punish vulnerable populations.
Next we will see voting rights taken away if don’t have covid card. I predict this coming. Insanity. Scary times!!!! God help us all!!! 🙏🏻"

I don’t wear one even when asked I got the Johnson shot because my wife asked me to because of her job she takes care of the elderly as an administrator at a retirement home.

2.0,"Those videos from Australia apply to Victoria and NSW, Most states aren't locked down, and it's certainly not nationwide.

0.0,"Your reporting on Australia is in accurate. I am currently in Queensland where there is no Covid 19 and no restrictions, this is the same for many states. Sydney however has had an out break of Covid 19 D the state there is trying to get it under control, thus no large gatherings. The protesters were told not to go, as gatherings spread Covid. They went there with the intent to break the laws. We have been fortunate in Australia to avoid deaths from Covid and are proud to say only a few deaths not 1000s of deaths that followed uncontrolled riots like the US. Perhaps the way fwd would be to tell protesters they are banned from wearing masks then they would protest that by wearing a mask."

Nothing about these times follow any kind of straight lines. Rule changes at every turn, they say follow the science without any consultation or debate. Science now is what the government leaders say it is. Having had the illness is the best defence from ever getting it again, but that’s not very profitable and if they can break down your natural immunity with a few jabs well you might just be the next casualty and that’s worth a few bucks. To say I’m dissolutions by what has happened is putting it mildly. Well we will March on."

This bloke is contagious and refuses to quarantine or self isolate. So I have no problem with them locking him up in forced quarantine (comparison to FEMA camps etc is a bit silly, really. It is just 2 weeks isolation which many countries are enforcing, and if he cops a fine or jail term for breaking the law, so what). Yes our Govt is insane, but that's because, unlike most of the world, they are still aiming for ZERO COVID, which is rapidly slipping through their inept fingers. And high school kids were NOT forced to vaccinate without parents in a stadium - it was totally voluntary, and many opted to not vaccinate. There is enough crap going on in the world to expose, without hyping stuff up - it just diminishes your credibility. Disappointed, but still a big fan :)"

Hmmm is San Francisco reistaling that law? Asking for a friend.
‘Serious breach of decorum’ ?? Isn’t that the equivalent of eating a salad with the big fork?!? Everything I ever needed to know about Pelosi can be boiled down to her ‘hair salon’ incident from 2020, where she got caught with her pants down and claimed ‘it was a set up!’ Stick it, Nancy. What a trashy human being.
New Zealand is run by a woke communist its sad
The hipocracy though it's disgusting and appalling is not New or a Surprise!! On the plus side we can be happy they will ALL go down in history as liers, cheaters, hypocrites and crooks!!! My opinion of course.

1.0,Obama had a Birthday party with possibly 600 guests of the rich and famous type and nobody wore masks. Mandates don't really apply to the elite in the democrat party or to some of their RINO friends because the mask mandate is about having power and control over others. The jews were forced to wear a yellow star on their clothing when outside.

It was true then, but not so much today. Fully half this country are sleazy hypocrites. It's not just leaders that you've shown us, I've seen dozens of pictures of liberal friends partying without masks. Recently, when they were publicly chastising people for not wearing them.

I did not hear that the Australian Police State shot and killed dogs merely to stop people from travelling to rescue them That's disgusting, and I know that liberals here would love that. They don't care about dogs, about kids, about race, about anything other than themselves and their own power"

Imagine Larry elder trying to defend his record next year, which would undoubtedly be super unpopular. He’d lose re-election for sure. However, if he wins this recall, it will be good for the GOP nationally because they can push propaganda saying how even “crazy commiefornia” was fed up with democrats and chose a Republican governor (despite the fact that he can win the recall election without a majority of the state’s votes). They will use this as evidence to push the party further right and it will help them fundraise in other states, the logic being that if democrats are even too crazy for California, then they’re clearly too crazy for states like Missouri or Ohio. We really can’t let that happen. We’ve got to prove to middle America that our candidates are far more reasonable and pragmatic and that the extremists are the republicans"

0.0,"In California, a recall election can be put into motion solely by getting a petition signed by a proportion of state citizens equal to or greater than 12% of the number of voters in the previous office election. As such, to force a recall election of Gavin Newsom--who won with 62% of the vote in 2018--only required 1.4 million signatures, or 3.5% of California's population. The recall is costing California $276 million and represents an attempted power grab by Republicans to take advantage of a non-regular election to unseat the democratically-elected governor.

According to the law, the recall is based on two questions: question one is a yes or no question about recalling Gavin Newsom, and question two is who would replace him were the yes vote to receive a plurality of the vote. So, technically, 3.5% of the population forces the other 96.5% to turn out in an irregular election to vote ""no"" by a plurality, or the most popular ""other"" candidate running (currently Republican Larry Elder with about 26% popularity) becomes governor. If a plurality votes ""yes,"" regardless of who they prefer, a candidate with less than 30% popularity can supplant the governor elected with over twice that popularity during a standard, regular election."

Only 65 signatures need to start the drive to recall and only 12% of the total votes counted in the last election needed for the recall to proceed. FWIW, Newsom beat his last opponent by 24%. However at 12.5 million votes cast, only 1.5 million needed for a recall to proceed. It gives the GOP a second bite at every election if they choose to take it. Seriously broken.  


I urge all California, left, right and center, not to sit this one out."

She lives in NV so it was 100% worth the effort to get another vote for Biden. Then i convinced my exhausted cousin to stop at her polling place after pulling a double at work. +2 votes for Biden in NV!

2.0,"While corporate money in politics can be considered bribery, most of it is legal in the US. Many of these companies will fund anyone on committees that oversee their particular market, so just about every congressman, state or federal, gets political donations from big corporations, and if they are committee chairs or get lots of press, they get more, regardless of political affiliation, as long as that corporation feels they can expect preferential treatment access. Every bill is backed by congressmen who take corporate money. I doubt AT&T is donating to ban abortion specifically, they are likely donating to many state and federal-level stooges hoping they will regulate their industry in AT&T's favor. If those stooges also happen to be right-wing jack-asses? AT&T probably doesn't care."

0.0,Yeah. It's too easy to unseat a governor who is only having a slight dip in popularity or if there is a motivated minority voting in a low turnout election. Plus the way that the replacement is selected produces a new governor with nothing near a popular mandate.

Don't retcon the reason for the recall election to be all about the PG&E settlement. The recall was started by a racist, anti-vaxx former sheriff of Yolo County, who coincidentally was just diagnosed with COVID. It is fundamentally undemocratic to allow 12% of the electorate to replace a popularly elected governor. It might be legal for now, but that doesn't make it right."

If one is so wrong surely it wouldn't be hard, certainly if you acknowledge it as wrong, you know the reasons yourself and can specify them for the public.

Especially with twitter who ban posts on covid they label as having a potentisl risk of spresding misinformation. By doing this they pretty much acknowledge people are incredibly credulous and naive. Otherwise why else would they ban it? Surely the individual could judge for themselves whether it is misinformation or not.

Besides. How do we reslly believe a corporation like twitter has our best interests?(As a citizen of America) They are openly are leftist and actively censor snd silence opposing views. Trunp is banned while we have terrorists like the Taliban alloud on there.

In my opinion they just censor opposing views because they know there is the fear of convincing them they(the poster) are right. In which they don't want that for propably some self centered reason or they want to maintain along with all other sources a monopoly on news with leftist indoctrination(Trans, LGTBTQ+, Feminist movement?, and whatever else.

The Texas 'heartbeat ban' isn't medically accurate because there's no heart that early in pregnancy, providers say

""Heartbeat bills"" are misnomers because there's no heart nor beating at 6 weeks of pregnancy. 

Doctors can only detect fluttering cells that will become the heart, and call it ""cardiac motion."" 

A 6-week pregnancy is an embryo, not a fetus, and fetal heart development is a continuum.

The new Texas law banning abortions after 6 weeks of pregnancy, like others like it, is often referred to as a ""heartbeat bill,"" indicating a cutoff point when doctors can detect a fetal heartbeat. 

As Texas Governor Greg Abbot said in a Facebook video right before signing the bill, it ""ensures that the life of every unborn child who has a heartbeat will be saved from the ravages of abortion."" The law is expected to be challenged and, if it prevails, will go into effect September 1, 2021. 

But Dr. Bhavik Kumar, a family medicine physician and abortion provider at the Planned Parenthood Center for Choice in Houston, told Insider ""pregnancies this early do not have a beating heart"" — and that's a medical fact. 

For one, a pregnancy that's six weeks along is still an embryo. It's not a fetus until the 9th week after conception or 11th week after the last menstrual period, according to Healthline. 

Plus, most women don't even know they're pregnant at six weeks, let alone get a doctor's appointment to confirm it. 

""At six weeks, most women would not have any clue they were even pregnant if they weren't carefully tracking menstrual cycles, and that doesn't even take into account the millions of women with irregular cycles who might go six weeks or longer between periods as a normal part of their life,"" Dr. Stephanie Ros, an OB-GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of South Florida, told Insider. 

She said at that point, the embryo is a quarter-inch long. ""It's barely noticeable on ultrasound, we often have to use transvaginal ultrasound to be able to see it at all,"" she said. 

What's really happening is 'cardiac motion' from cells that will become the heart

The so-called ""heartbeat"" that's detected at six weeks isn't a heart nor is it beating. ""There's electrical activity within cells that will become a heart, and we see that on an ultrasound machine as a flickering that can be audible through the machine,"" Kumar said. ""We refer to that as cardiac motion."" 

""Certainly different people have different feelings around seeing that and what that means,"" Kumar added, ""and that is up to each person to decide how they value that."" 

Indeed, the president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which represents more than 60,000 OB-GYNs in the US, made a similar point in 2019 in opposition to ""heartbeat bills.""

""Pregnancy and fetal development are a continuum,"" he said. ""What is interpreted as a heartbeat in these bills is actually electrically induced flickering of a portion of the fetal tissue that will become the heart as the embryo develops."" That tissue continues to develop throughout the first trimester. 

Only in the past few decades has the technology been advanced enough to detect cardiac motion that early, Dr. Saima Aftab, medical director of the Fetal Care Center at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami, told LiveScience in 2019. The fluttering, she said, also doesn't indicate the viability of the future heart or the pregnancy. "
2.0,"I get it. I’m team thanos, I want less people on earth. If we pronounce people dead when their heart stops, then it's not out of this world to start life when the heartbeat starts. And if they did the bill for 9 weeks for the heart to develop, we would still have the same outrage."

0.0,"How does that alleviate the burden of carrying a rapist's child?  How does that (to put it bluntly) undestroy their body?  How does that prevent the hospital bill, or the trauma of childbirth?  How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria?  How does that make it less of an economic burden to take an unwanted child and foist them into a poorly organized and definitely underfunded foster system (it's Texas, in case you think they care) that _mostly_ results in molestation, prostitution and abuse?  How does that not further the burden of guilt placed on someone who never wanted that child to begin with?

Utterly and completely destroying a good section of the work force, emotionally, physically, financially and in all ways permanently, (unless they have a neuralizer, panacea or a winning lottery ticket respectively) is not good for the economy.

And that's just considering the unlucky and unwilling mother.  What of her coworkers, or her significant other?  They have to pick up the hours or those companies simply do without, resulting in lost revenue, quality, and supply.  Have you ever worked a 12 hour double shift, or an 8 hour triple shift?  Because I fucking have, and I wasn't even involved.  Now you have to deal with burn out and turn over from an entirely unrelated set of people, time into training and damaged product or shoddy services resulting in slow-down FOR 9 MONTHS.  And that's if they can come back at all!  The U.S. at large basically doesn't even have a support system for pregnant people if you compare it to other first world nations.

There is no ""what if we try x."". This is a bad law designed to make broken homes that a political base can scapegoat and slavewage 16 years down the line.  It is designed to be economically expensive because that's _the whole point._"
2.0,"Do you know how much an abortion at planned parent hood or some other abortion clinic is? Honest question I do not know. I found planned parent hood says it could be $0-$1,500. but I am not sure what other places charge, I know in a hospital it can be 5,000 or a bit more for vaginal birth or higher for C-section. How can any women really afford a abortion then or delivery period then? 

You talk about How does that (to put it bluntly) undestroy their body? or the trauma of childbirth? How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria.  Have you seen the side effects of both a hormonal pill abortion or a medical abortion? For hormonal pill, it is not unusual for a women having to go to the hospital because the bleeding does not stop, but continues to get worse. Some women become sick and mentally damaged seeing that amount of blood and the cells of the baby after cleaning up that mess, During the surgical abortion where they stick a vacuum up there, it is not unusual for the doctor to cause damage to the uterus and other organs that actuary harm the chance of having another baby in the future, along with bleeding, and causing tears that might need to be surgically fixed. So you will have to go to the hospital for surgery. which case is all traumatic in my opinion. and more of an economic burden now they have more bills to pay. (not saying vaginal birth or C-section is better they all have their risk too)

to your other argument, why cant an employer higher a temp from an agency? There are temp agency that people do sign up with to find part time work, they usually work part time or full time during a short period of work, do you think those short term workers would like to have that job for a bit?"

2.0,"Brazilians are clowns...I know it  ran away from the country as soon as I could. The truth however is more complex and it is not fully portrayed around the world. There are things, a few of them where Bolsonaro is right and on point, others show how ill-suited he is. With that being said, the options were even worse in the last elections.
The Supreme Court in brazil is the biggest joke there ever was, it needs to be completely reformed (The US supreme court should also be reformed, by the way)
The brazilians have a supreme court where ANY lawyer, appointed by a POLITICIAN can become a member, no need to be a judge, no need to be someone suited for the job, and that is a lifetime position! ANY supreme court that is unbiased and trustworthy need to be populated by FEDERAL JUDGES, appointe by election amongst all federal judges in the country, and I said JUDGES, not mere, ill-prepared lawyers. The political appointment process needs to be eliminated, and until it is so, no one will trust the courts. (that holds true in Brazil, US or any democracy).
Also, the voting issue, Bolsonaro is for electronic PLUS paper ballot, so it could be audited, similarly to the US...imagine an election where the electronic votes could not be audited? Yes, that is Brazil. But guess, the brazilian (comunists-inclined) opposition is against that. There is no transparency throughout society, and a society that has its powers opaque to its population, is a democracy of the rich and powerful, (like Russia, Belarus, China....and the list goes on) and all of these countries, including Brazil and US are heading that way unless structural changes are made....and those are usually painful. Inhave little hope though."
0.0,"You are saying shit. Bolsonaro supporters want a coup to keep Bolsonaro in the power as a dictator, it is what they truly dream of. 

Bolsonaro fighting corruption? Haha You must idolatrate  him to say this nonsense. 
Even the Lava-jato operation that has put Lula in jail he fought against. Now, we  know that his whole family is involved  crimes of stealing money of their employees in the government. He also protected the guy that as asking bribes when buying vaccine."
0.0,"I agree, there are a lot of reasons why Bolsonaro got there in the first place. I even voted for Bolsonaro in 2018, but because I was disillusioned with the polarized reality of that time and thought he represented a drastic change and action, but as it turns out he was another right-wing populist nutjob, and I slowly began realizing it just like many americans did with Trump. You rightfully point out the Supreme Court is politically appointed, but guess who appointed a judge who freed Lula from jail? You rightfully point out corruption is rampant, but guess who is the one who destroyed the Car-Wash Operation? Yes, Bolsonaro, because turns out, he is a corrupt crook along with his entire family. In the beginning, I used to believe that ""Bolsonaro is a fascist who wants to be dictator"" was just leftist conspiracy, but the more he began actually voicing against democratic institutions, the more I realized all these speeches about ""cleaning the swamp"", or about ""saving the nation"", or about ""the corrupts within congress"" have always been far-right dogwhistles and I had fallen this conspiracy rabbithole, which I have slowly been escaping ever since the pandemic began.

So no, there's no such a thing as ""communist-inclined"" opposition against Bolsonaro, because a lot of prominent right-wing political movements such as the MBL broke off with Bolsonaro, so his opposition is pretty broad even though there are indeed left-wing people in the opposition, just like every opposition against a far-right government. No, there is no such a thing as ""Bolsonaro is for electronic plus paper ballot"", because even if he was for that, the true intention of his when voicing for this agenda is to make people distrust the system and de-stabilize democracy so he can come out as ""the man who will solve it all"", and this entire agenda of electronic plus paper ballot is another dogwhistle for ""the democratic system is bad and I want to be dictator"". Yes, there is no transparency throught society and yes Brazil is a banana republic, but the ""twist"" is that Bolsonaro himself is part of the infamous ""Centrão"" of brazilian politics, you know, the ""banana politicians"" themselves, of the rich and powerful?

To summarize: the only thing Bolsonaro ever did for Brazil is to pave the path for the gangsters of Lula to come back and continue their legacy of corruption in the name of the poor, he destroyed the legacy of the sane right-wing who only wanted to fight the corruption of Lula and the PT, and most importantly: the deaths of thousands who fell into his far-right rethoric that the ""virus doesn't exist"", or ""if it exists, China made it up"", just like what happened to many americans with Trump. So fuck Bolsonaro, fuck his far-right nutjobs and fuck his terroristic ""milicias""."

I lived through the Reagan eras, the country has moved forward,  including LGBTQ  rights. Is it as fast as I'd like? Absolutely not - and why I'm involved in helping local candidates run for office.  Politics is slow AF, and the dems have a very large and diverse tent for ideas. Theres the old adage,  ""dems fall in love, Republicans fall in line"" which holds true and why we don't see th Qcult kicked to the curb (or tea party).

Yeah, it took trump to turn out the dem vote. Issue is, the ones who can and need to move the country forward at a quick step,  are millennials,  who just aren't old enough to be reliable voting bloc. 

The major focus really needs to be on un-fuhking the gerrymandered states and allow for more easy access.  This would truly ensure progress and provide a cushion /relax fear of pushing legislation forward that needs to be done,  and not worry about midterm backlash as the Republicans would be nearly dead in the water."

0.0,It's a little bit more complicated than you're presenting it. We're on the razor edge of holding power and barely holding together a coalition with moderate democrats. As a progressive myself sometimes it feels like this non yielding outlook is naive. In order to get what you're demanding requires us to make gains in the house and Senate. Throwing away your vote in protest almost guarantees you'll never get what you want.
2.0,I'm not trying to persuade you. You are as dense as the fascists.  I'm probably going to just leave.
0.0,"If you want all that, stop talking shit on Democrats and make sure they get elected.  I've lived in Virginia for 20 years, and for the first time last year Democrats achieved a statewide trifecta:  the governor's mansion and both houses of the legislature.  Since that time, Virginia has legalized cannabis, raised the minimum wage, secured voting rights, expanded public healthcare, passed environmental protections, and a host of other things you no doubt value.

You know how they did it?  By having a solid majority where Democrat legislators from more conservative areas could defect on certain issues.  Republicans did NOTHING to help any of this happen, but Democrats still had the numbers because their majority is solid.

""Both sides are the same"" is the stupidest, most counterproductive thing people are saying right now, and it needs to stop.  It's not based on fact.  It's something half-informed people say to make themselves sound skeptical and savvy, but in the end it only destroys any chance of making progress."
0.0,"I think you responded to the wrong person.  I'm not a progressive.  I'm a left-leaning moderate.  I used to be an occasional swing voter too.

And I don't actually believe you're any sort of Democrat at all.  Just a Republican in disguise trying to sow division in the party.  Make claims to the contrary all you want; it's your actions that show it."
2.0,Weren’t they discussing ways of NOT doing it? And only one of those is a Democrat anyway. Yang and Sanders are independents aren’t they?
2.0,"Vote for the people who start the fire or the people who don’t put out the fire, either way you burn."
2.0,">ways of not doing it

They were talking about side options for companies and squabbling over nuance but it was a solid push for m4a with a few different flavors. 

>independents

I don't think so, they are democrats but at the edges of the current tent and appeal to progressives and *some* independents (and fringe ""libertarians."" Whom are often ignorant of what libertarianism is and want to be contrarian, or - and I contend, a large portion are made up of bots bad faith internet actors. Look at the Bernie subs and bizarre overlap with thedonald + redpill+ language).

Edit: this isn't to say Bernie voters are not real, I know plenty who were,  they just didn't act like or talk like what you see in those subs or online.  Most of the Bernie bros hate major portions of the internet (millennials) for security concerns.  At least, the ones I know irl."

0.0,"Texas won't secede because... Honestly I'm too exhausted to explain why the state can't at this point. It just can't. As for most rational Texans, we're American, or at least we try and uphold the things that originally made this country and state great, however those assholes ""in charge"" are very un-American, they spit in the face of those that know what it means to be Texan. Thankfully we have some elections coming up soon. 

As for stepping foot in the state, don't. You're not missing out on anything (honestly what the hell would someone even come here for?). Save your money and buy yourself something nice with it. Deny this state your sales tax. You want to hurt a man, hurt him in the wallet."
2.0,"I'm going to have an unpopular opinion here, but it is not all of Texas. It is the oppressive political system they are in and if they secede, the women affected by the barbaric laws they are making will have even fewer rights. 

I understand the frustration with a portion of that state, but the what the Democrats in that state have been doing shows the desperation of a large section of the population. The productive action would be to call for justice and national influence to be put on those passing these laws. Please do not forget that the state is not a monolith and you condemn all of them with statements like this.

Edit: I guess I didn't know how to spell secede."

2.0,How about Texas democrats start selling it better and fucking up the GOP instead.....when dipshits in Texas like Beto O'Rourke go on record saying he will vote to ban the guns most Texans have as a prime example...Texas Democrats look like they're just as fucki g stupid as the rest of the damn state.  Until Texas Dems get smart & sell it better to their rural constituents you're gonna get fucked up the ass every time.
2.0,"They're doing it themselves, notice how there's been no legislation at all concerning the failing energy grid and winter is coming. Those people are obsessed with cultural issues that don't effect their daily lives at all, unlike their failing energy grid. Darwinism in action"

2.0,Women is protected by Texas law it’s providers who were in trouble

It easier to just accept that they aren’t here to help us but to maintain the integrity of the system."
2.0,"Yes, but the FACE Act, in its wording, protects both women and facilities."
0.0,"The thing is, if ""pro-life"" conservatives truly wanted fewer abortions, they would 100% support better sex education in schools and easier (or free) access to contraceptives, because those are the only two reliable methods of reducing the number of abortions. 

They go on and on about ""saving the life of the child"", but what about the quality of life for that child? Are Texas voters going to improve their foster care system? Will they support giving financial aid to mothers who can't afford the children that they never wanted? I don't hear any mention from them about what they are willing to do to support these unwanted children. 

Why are they silent about helping these unwanted children? Because they don't really care about the children. They only care about punishing women for being sexually active. They want women to suffer because those women aren't conforming to their conservative ideals."
0.0,"Pro-Life Religious Conservatives also love advocating for people who are on life support but will otherwise not get better. People who cannot advocate for themselves e.g. the braindead or the unborn are a great campaigning point for the conservative right because it requires no resources and allows them to both scare people and make people angry at the perceived moral backwardness of progressives.

0.0,Yeah no wonder rightoids chose the heart over the brain when deciding what’s alive
2.0,So what restrictions are we placing on men then?
0.0,"In all fairness, while a fetus doesn’t yet a conscious, they are still likely to be born (unless there’s a as opposed to a brain dead person

0.0,"Republicans once tried to steal a brain-dead woman from her family to keep her alive as a way of responding to exactly this argument.    
"
2.0,Is it illegal in Texas to put the fetus on life support and then pull the plug?
0.0,"Well, I think some Republicans are smart enough to realize that if they outlaw pulling life support on people who are brain dead, hospitals would be overwhelmed with care for individuals who had no chance of walking out the door again.

But Republicans have no problem telling women they need to be life support for a fetus, whether the woman chooses to or not."
0.0,The same people yammering on about abortion being murder believe that pulling the plug on a brain dead person is also murder. Remember Terry Schivo?
2.0,These monsters oppose that too. No matter how much their grandma is suffering they will refuse to end her misery.
0.0,"There is no logic when dealing with people willing to do mental gymnastics to fit their square beliefs into the round holes of reality. Let’s not get into the argument of let’s force motherhood on girls but not force fatherhood on boys. Or here’s a good one that’ll put them in a logic loop, if an illegal immigrant is pregnant does that mean her child is a us citizen?"
2.0,"This is a messy analogy. Obviously a fetus at six weeks is “alive” both sides know this. A brain dead person is at the end of their conscious and a fetus is at the beginning. That’s the real difference.

I don’t think republicans chose the heartbeat detection because that means human life. They think it’s human life from the start. They just know they have to keep it legal in SOME capacity, no matter how minor. The heart best is a symbolic choice for them. And it just so happens to be before most women even know that they are pregnant."
2.0,"Thinking back to Terri Shiavo, I'm pretty sure conservatives were arguing not to unplug her."
0.0,i’m all for abortion but how is someone about to die and someone ab to be born comparable
1.0,Interesting argument but the difference is that braindead people will never be cognitive again whereas fetuses are still growing into cognitive people
2.0,Let’s go with just not killing people at all. That would be nice.

Women must be free to choose, not just for their own sakes, but for the sake of their children."
0.0,"This is of course correct. They don’t want abortions to go down, they want women to stop having sex (except with them of course). It isn’t about abortion, it’s about sex and who they think should and shouldn’t be having it."
0.0,"Its 100% about judgment and control. If you allow free access to contraceptives and sex ed, you are condoning sinners. To them, its a sin trade- sex or abortion."

0.0,"Everything that the religious right supports makes sense in the context of punishing women for sex and does not make sense in the context of preventing abortions: abstinence only education, prohibitions on birth control and lack of government support for families. At some point in time we have to stop giving abusers the benefit of their word."
1.0,Yes but the definition of “life” and “alive” can be debated based on what you believe. According to science everything is alive in some way as long as the cells are alive
0.0,That was one very public case. Brain dead people get taken off life support every day and not a peep from the right. They also have no issue with taking a human life if they feel the human doesn’t deserve to live(executions).
0.0,"There is no difference. 

Either you support life, or you don’t. 

The republicans do not. 

You cannot claim to be pro life and be in favor of the death penalty.

You cannot claim to be pro life and be in favor of someone who refuses to wear a mask, knowing doing so may kill a child."
0.0,That’s horrific and sad. So many tragic stories that get conveniently ignored by people who call themselves religious. I am so GD tired of these people ruining the entire world for everyone else. So tired and so angry that I hope they do not get vaccines and get to meet their sky daddy sooner than later. The preverbal silver lining.
0.0,"Woah, that seems to be quite a severe reaction to a joke about the unconstitutional stupidity going on in Texas. Guess you aren’t competent enough to have a baby or raising children either. Womp womp."
2.0,The type of people who shouldn’t be raising children include people who hide behind a screen and throw needless insults at strangers. I’m sure whatever little spawn comes from you will also be an asshole.
2.0,I agree that some of these people just don’t want what they perceive as an easy out for irresponsable sexual behaviors. Yes But a lot of these people very genuinely believe it’s wrong to end a human life in the womb. And not everyone who believes that is religious or even conservative.
0.0,"Irrelevant, neither have the right to use someone else's body or resources to continue existing. 

If a person needed one of your lungs to live, should you be forced to give it to them?"

0.0,"Why should it matter? It is an embryo not a baby. It is a woman's choice, nit the court's or government's while still not viable outside her body. Forcing a woman to carry is inhumane. Back to illegal, unsafe abortions?"
0.0,"""Noone has the right to use someone else's body or resources to continue existing""
The point is true in all aspects but it still extends way after a person is born, Infact, baby, children and even many teenagers may not be equipped to survive. In so the argument you provide also excuses a parent putting their infant baby on the street and leave."
2.0,"No. I mean, I think that’s a weak analogy. But yes, I agree abortion should be legal.

Abortion is killing a human. But sometimes it’s legal to kill humans. War. Abortion, endings brain dead people."
2.0,The media is full of shit on both sides. I believe abortion should be legal. I also think it is infanticide. And Im a Democrat. All these things can be true at once.

2.0,"I was asked a question (that has been deleted) about ""what civ"" I'm ""proud"" of. Interesting question!

I was raised steeped in Western culture. Grandparents in the German film industry, photographer dad, actress mom. They taught me (some) German and French. Went to international school. Studied physics and medieval studies in a college with a Great Books program. 

I can't think of a better way to spend an afternoon than at the Met or MOMA. 

Am I ""proud"" of Beethoven and Mozart? I had nothing to do with them. I enjoy them, I love them, I am deeply moved by them. But pride implies personal achievement. Just look it up: 

1. feeling deep pleasure or satisfaction as a result of one's own achievements, qualities, or possessions or those of someone with whom one is closely associated.
""a proud grandma of three boys""
2. having or showing a high or excessively high opinion of oneself or one's importance.
""a proud, arrogant man""

I am quite proud of a short play I wrote that got a good review in the NY Times. It brought me to LA where I met my wife who was a TV writer. (Our little joke is that we met through the NY Times.)

I am proud of my father's work, with which I had little to do, but I helped him in the darkroom and changed his film sometimes. 

I work in the space program and I'm proud of that, though I'm in a support position and have nothing to do with designing or selecting missions.

But to be ""proud"" of Monet or Voltaire just seems bizarre to me. I love them and would defend them, and I'm deeply moved by them, and would be devastated if the works were destroyed. But pride doesn't enter into it."

This shit right here is why the Dems, who represent like 60% of the country's population, can't get anything done. When the GOP get power, they fucking use it. When the Dems gets power, they waste 18 months trying to be polite and bipartisan, then get fucking crushed in the midterms.

Voting rights, reproductive rights, climate efforts, income inequality reduction, and every other democratic effort is going to fail in the name of tradition and decorum."

Maybe it’s because I’m 38, and my entire adult voting life has been watching bad government and watching the Republicans win, even when Democrats have power. 

Trump isn’t the beginning of something, he’s the culmination of decades of bad government on Republican terms. He’s the inevitable endgame of the Republican Party. 

If we can’t expect Biden to change, then we deserve to lose in 2022 and he deserves to be impeached by the Republicans in 2023. 

Historians in free countries— which won’t be ours— will look back and consider this all to be a progression, not a sudden shift from good government to bad government with the election of Trump.

The election of Trump was the natural reaction to America daring to elect a black man, and you’d better believe Republicans will burn the country to the ground before they ever see Kamala Harris in the Oval Office. 

We our on borrowed time, a narrow window, and Biden is counting on institutions to save us when they have already failed."

They wouldn’t allow democrats to pass any bills at all. Please don’t make this about me. Unless you understand that republicans spend their entire terms in congress sabotaging democrats, this conversation is futile. Many republicans came by and went, but Gingrich, Boehner, McConnell and McCarthy have been the worst in modern history. Democrats legislate, republicans on the other hand, spend their entire time resisting democratic legislations without offering any alternatives. Pro-life and white supremacy aren’t what make the nation move forward. When was the last time republicans introduced any bills for the general welfare? Tax cuts for the wealthy?"

But, sure. The filibuster, man. Totally the savior of American democracy."

0.0,"This passage from Numbers is always mentioned and always dismissed. Most pro-life people will interpret this as a recipe for causing sterility, not abortion. Either way, pretty disturbing."
0.0,"In modern history and right after Gingrich, the only time republicans were this extreme was when Obama came in. No one is saying there was never any disagreements between democrats and republicans, it’s expected and as a matter of fact, it’s part of the democratic process in which the system of checks and balances is based on and compromise being the ultimate outcome. And yes, Trump did finalize the radicalism of the Republican Party that went directly after the very institutions of the federal government. That’s not disagreements, it’s anarchy, sedition and treason. I’m fully aware of the racist, anti-semitic, homophobic, Islamophobic and sexist agenda of the Republican Party to attend to its confederate base, but it didn’t amount to an insurrection on the Capitol until Trump came in."
1.0,"Yea, like 4 years under Trump being the no party. Grow the fuck up and try and understand that you can't do anything that they can't do. Make a new rule, they will show you how to use it.

Or when the Republican Party embraced the southern strategy. 

Or when the Republican Party essentially stole the 2000 election. 


Again, the crisis we’re dealing with now did not start with Trump. 

The insurrection on the Capitol was the inevitable conclusion. 

McCain gave us Sarah Palin. 

Murkowski and Collins and Romney aren’t the good guys that are going to help us save democracy. 

There are no moderate Republicans, and haven’t been any moderate Republicans in a long time. 

We’ve had multiple opportunities to stop this crisis from unfolding, it’s just the Democratic Party, in spite of all evidence to the contrary, continued to at least pretend to believe the GOP was operating in good faith, until the insurrection happened. 

Anyways, I think we’re both basically in agreement and on the same side. 

I just think our crisis began well before Trump and the insurrection happened."

That's the key, if the State isn't enforcing the law, the law can't be challenged, law stands. Come on Dems, I know it's not in your passive nature, but let's get tough, it's time.

He caused their deaths.   

The even worse hypocrisy was their absolute radio silence on this--Trump literally CAUSING the needless deaths of four American soldiers--after years and years and years of screaming about Benghazi (which was an attack on the US Embassy in a known hotspot, the same as other attacks during the Bush and Reagan presidencies--AND Hillary had requested add'l security, and the GOP had refused it)."

2.0,"Same.

Glad I served under a Commander in Chief that I respected."
0.0,"Okay... but we've been pointing out literally this meme over and over again since like, 2004 at least. 

""No way they could make John Kerry look like a pussy, he was a highly decorated combat veteran while GW was getting high in Texas"" 

""They've said all this stuff about Obama being a Kenyan Muslim who eats dogs, but they'll HAVE to change their tune now that bin Laden is dead""

""No way that Republicans in Kentucky would pick swamp thing Mitch McConnell over a distinguished Air Force pilot with all the funding in the world""

It's like dude, you don't get it... these people could not give less of a shit about ""the troops"" or ""the flag"" and they certainly don't care about being caught up in some technical hypocrisy. They like cruelty, they like the war. They love that violence is being done to people who they dislike, that's all. It's a really simple, yet totally terrifying."
0.0,"I don’t know what this means. For 4 years we demanded trump stop talking about all the things he said Hillary did wrong - now Biden wins and we’re talking about all the things trump did wrong. 

I know it doesn’t go over well in the Reddit hive mind but Biden won. Trumps out. We need to stop talking about him and hold our current politicians accountable for the good and the bad."
0.0,"Not sure how  trump blaming Hillary, who was never president, has anything to do with democrats calling out republican hypocrisy. Granted I don't follow Biden’s press conferences very closely but I can't seem to recall him trump or Pence by name very often at all."
0.0,"The problem with your position is that it ignores that Trump did everything he could to sabotage Biden. And his appointees have been slowed down. You are aware that Ted Cruz has prevented Biden's State Dept appointees from being confirmed, right?"
0.0,"This post is focused on the hypocrisy of republicans not the fact that both during Trump and Bidens administration US soldiers died.

Calling everything that calls out hypocrisy ""whataboutism"" is dishonest at best and malicious at worst."
0.0,"It still occasionally blows my mind, everything else about him aside, that the media acted like it was a big deal that at George Bush's funeral, Trump didn't make it about himself. They acted like it was a big deal that *the president* behaves with the decorum I'd expect from a healthy 5 year old."
1.0,"I’m talking about this post - per my prior comments. 

Why are we pulling up how trump behaved? He’s out. Biden’s in. Saying “reminder - this is his trump behaved” comes across as saying “well it’s ok Biden screwed this up because what about trump!” 

I’m fine being in the minority on this opinion I just wish the left would stop being so hypocritical."
0.0,"Come on. It is honestly, literally, “what about what Trump did, it was way worse” at least be big enough to admit it. I am And I was saying in 2015, “what the fuck, Trumpty Dumpty is a freakin sociopath, NO! “"
2.0,"I think you're misinterpreting the ""it's fine Biden screwed up"" aspect, I don't get the impression he's being let off the hook. I can't blame anyone for continuing to highlight the previous administration's shortcomings in comparable situations to what the current one is being held brutally accountable for."
2.0,"You can interpret it that way if you want but I don't understand it that way. The title calls out the Republican hypocrisy for blasting Biden now while being fine with Trump back in 2017.

By that standard calling out the different reactions to similar situations aka hypocrisy is from now on always ""whataboutism"" and we will no longer be able to call out hypocrisy at all.

Also what is blasted here is neither the situation leading up to the events nor the failures that led to them but rather the reaction to them."
2.0,"dude isn't this post and entire context just Dems doing the same, i.e blasting trump back in 2017 and being fine with Biden now? You can change the text to ""Your reminder that when four American soldiers were killed in niger in 2017 Dems raised hell"" and title to ""Dems hypocrisy"" and post it on one of the conservative subs and it'll fit right in.

I've experienced political shithousry in other countries but it's on another level in the US, ~~politicians~~ actually more the supporters, of both sides do the same thing when their guy is not in power. They also do the same thing when your guy is in power. When trump was in t_d was all about obama and drone strikes and now all the dem subs are *but trump did worse*."
1.0,"So what exactly would you call a “whataboutism” then? It is bringing up a perceived misdeed, of the past, from the opposition, to deflect from the criticism of a current situation. Exactly what this is. Just like when the Trump supporters would bring up Clinton or Obama to avoid addressing things Trump did. (Sure he might’ve said “grab ‘em by the pussy” but that was just locker room talk. Clinton actually sexually harassed his underlings) Doesn’t that sound familiar?"
0.0,"Dunno in which reality you live but while there are certainly die hard democrats who see no fault in what Biden does the amount of worship Trump gets from republicans is on a whole different level.

There is literally a hearing about the Afghanistan withdrawal initiated by democrats about the Afghanistan withdrawal.

Trump instigated a mob to storm the capitol and got much less heat from republicans than Biden now gets from democrats.

 just as an example.

So no. It is not even close on both sides and thinking that both sides do the exact same thing is again either misinformed or just plain dishonest."
0.0,"Right. I am a lifelong Democrat but I am not so eat up with partisan bullshit that I deny the obvious. When we do it we are pointing out hypocrisy, when they do it they are deflecting. Ok, live the delusion."
2.0,"It is exactly as you describe it. Whataboutism is bringing up something that you think was worse to make another mistake seem less bad.

I only disagree that this is the intention of this post. The intention is as I read it to make people remember how different republicans REACTED to the things Trump did wrong compared to how they react to Bidens mistakes now.

The huge difference to me is that the title attacks republicans for their hypocrisy and does not focus on whether Trump or Bidens mistakes were worse."
2.0,"I was never questioning the validity of the complaint, one way or the other. I was simply pointing out that it is the same tactic. Don’t you understand that the right also believe they are pointing out the hypocrisy of the left when they do it?"
0.0,Well duh … that’s why they’re gerrymandering districts and making it difficult for dems to vote.  American democracy at work.
0.0,"We’re still in a battle for the soul. If America chooses not to vote blue in 2024 we’ve lost the battle. After all this bullshit it’s just amazing people can’t find away to vote. The US wouldn’t be the first country to slide into fascism. That said, a good sign will be if Newsom wins the recall by a large margin. But look a CA 48th district, after all the crap Democrats don’t show up to vote."
0.0,I'm going to say something controversial:  Fani Willis does not think she can find 12 people that would convict Donald Trump.  She knows that there would be jury nullification.  I mean they have Trump on the phone clearly interfering with the Georgia election.  It doesn't matter.  Trump would have enough supporters that would vote not guilty even if they saw him shoot someone on fifth avenue.
2.0,"Do you not already do that?

It's how I warm up my clicking finger. Hop on YouTube, report hate speech, watch cat videos. Work done well."
0.0,Fox News has all comments turned off? Are there other ways to find assholes making asshole comments?
0.0,"It's unlikely to go anywhere unless Tucker starts just using full-on racial epithets.

Most of the mainstream rightwing stuff is careful enough to keep things duplicitous enough for plausible deniability. ""We weren't calling *Mexicans* criminals, we were calling *immigrants* criminals!"" If something is *unambiguously* racist or hate speech, then yeah go ahead and report."
2.0,"I don’t want YouTube to censor anything but those shouldn’t them up on my searches or recommendation unless I use “Fox News” in the search box. YouTube promotes hate videos on my search that’s my problem, for PR they block bunch of videos but they allow most videos to appear on your searches. Tech companies has to fix the algorithm but they are scared it will affect the user activity on their app."
2.0,"I’ve just stopped looking at YouTube’s news channels. The comments, no matter who’s in office, are full of whining babies I couldn’t care less about. They need to find something better to do rather than being pathetic losers who talk to the 10,000 other losers also trying to ‘make an impact?’ about the political situation. I too watch Fox News for comedy. ~~F~~Tucker once started saying we should all identify as the opposite gender to break records and that shit was hilarious."
0.0,"Well, no shit. All these recounts, and law suits. Now the insurrection. They are doing their best to destroy the country."
2.0,What exactly does Reich mean when he says Democrats need to wake up? Is he implying that there's reticence towards change and crushing these freaks? Reich is great but I expect a little more than just foot stomping and demanding the magic wand that doesn't exist. The only Democrats need to wake up about is freaking VOTING. The end.
2.0,They are making it legitimate by filing lawsuits. People follow news but never the actual hearings. US should have spent more on education and critical thinking programs in schools.
0.0,"Frankly, if Democrats don’t show up to vote the country will slide into fascism. Look at Texas, Georgia and Florida. That restaurant in Florida that doesn’t allow Biden voters as patrons should clue people in. You just can’t expect to not vote and have things fall in your lap."
0.0,"Republicans have the audacity to speak on accountability. 

Griffith is in the Sedition Caucus and hasn't called for any accountability for any of Trump's actions. He hasn't supported any efforts to hold people accountable for He votes lockstep with his fellow Republicans no matter what is best for his constituents or the country. 

Republicans are trying to keep the focus on the feigned outrage over Afghanistan."
0.0,I got an idea Rep Griffith can resign.
0.0,How bout all of them with involvement in the Jan6 insurrection resign.  And Trump negotiated that withdrawal deal.
1.0,"Andy was a Democrat, and Liberal.  This guy is a piece of shit."
0.0,"I started a Canva project tonight for it. Seems easy enough. Just need to populate it with good, articulate Dem ideas.
I’m thinking I’m going to focus on our position rather than “other guys are bad”."
2.0,"

Click on ""Download the Party Platform"" and take a look at ours.

You have to be careful; your state group wants to kind of oversee what literature is put out. Simply because the Dem messaging should be consistent and fact-based. 

Are you working with your county party? Your County Chair should know what to do. Or your Congressional District Chair."
2.0,"Yes, that's exactly what you want to do. Facts and information about what Dems are doing and want to do.. not all negativity about Rs. 

What state are you in? You should be able to look at your state party platform. See what your party is doing at the state level and integrate that with info relative to your community."
2.0,Yes I reached out to my county parties chair to ensure we are getting something out. She agreed with my assessment and hadn’t realized how short we were on any kind of resource for the tables.
2.0,To be honest I started working not even considering the state or county Dem party could have different So thanks for that idea.
0.0,No walls... The idea of a border wall is so stupid. Regardless of where you put it. Oregonians  talk about one on our southern border all the time. Lol the Cali's would just come through Nevada. A boycott would be a cheaper solution.
0.0,Pretty crappy solution for all the Texas Democrats like me that are trying to change things
2.0,No.  This reminds me too much of my conservative friends talking about doing the same for California or New York.
0.0,There are some good people in Texas. We can't leave them behind or the Texiban will destroy them.
0.0,"Better yet:

Let the entire south secede. No war, no guns, no violence. Just paperwork. 

The thing is, no federal money either. 

Let’s see if the Texas economy is enough to subsidize all those red states without federal supplements.

Hell, they can keep most of the flyover states as well. 

Let’s just make it the Northeast, the West Coast, and everyone else is all on their own…"
2.0,So does that mean men do have a voice when it comes to abortion now? Or does that not compute?
1.0,Then shouldn’t us men get a seat at the table for the abortion discussion now?
1.0,If you can program A Generation of children to believe this kind of bullshit you can easily convince them that America is systematically racist and the vaccinated can be infected by people that aren’t sick.
1.0,"Whats weirder.   Their contradictions in ""science"" or their love for killing babies?"
1.0,this what happens when allow post modernist scum to overrun your education system
2.0,"The word ""fact"" has been politicized, unfortunately.  People use it all the time in attempts to shut down arguments, and it really has diminished the meaning of the word."
2.0,I honestly cannot comprehend the depth of the insanity with these people. It really IS a mental illness.
2.0,even the devil realises human society is fucked
1.0,"My god. What is happening with Gen Z? Can't we returning to the old years where there were Girls and Boys, Women and Men?"
1.0,"Then men have a say in abortion? Is that the new official ""liberal"" stance?"
1.0,So it's alright to murder a baby because some people with body dismorphia have babies? WTF is wrong with these people?
1.0,"If you have two X chromosomes, you’re a female. Last I checked, only humans with two X chromosomes could get pregnant. Doesn’t matter what you identify as or what your birth cert says. Science in this case is fact and if you are pregnant or have gotten pregnant, you are female"
1.0,"Let me check if a man ever had a baby. 

Nope. Never. 

You know why? Men do not physically have a vagina. 

That’s a scientific fact. But reality doesn’t mean anything to the far-left. If they “feel” it, it’s a “fact.”  

The clowns have taken over."
2.0,"Wait so it's no longer a women's issue because women don't exist. Meaning men CAN have a valid opinion on abortions. Suggesting otherwise suggests that trans men aren't real men.

It is transphobic to say men can't have an opinion on abortions."
1.0,"And we wonder why mental illness is more prevalent on the left?

It's because from the moment they're born, they are fed nothing but alternate reality, anti-science propaganda. 

How in the blue hell can you not end up messed up if you believe the world is X, only to grow up and discover that 98% of the world is Y and you're part of the 2% that believe otherwise."
2.0,I have no compassion for the ignorant.
1.0,"Well let's see, to leftists, wrong is right, bad is good, down is up, and losing is winning."
1.0,"Because these dummies think a girl can transform into a dude so when she gets pregnant they think men can have babies...

Reading that logic is like trying to follow a psychopath's mind... unpleasant"
1.0,"hang on , seriously... I think she might be mentally ill ?what she's saying is beyond lefty nonsense its actually genuinely deranged , even the most ardent of Trans ""female"" activists don't think they can get pregnant ?! you sure shes not a troll?"
2.0,"she should be banned from social media for stupidity, she doesn't even know what fact means"
2.0,Jen Psaki begs to differ.  She stated clearly that only women could get pregnant and make hard choices re. abortion.
1.0,"This is the same kind of person that says men can't make laws about women's bodies. Yet, according to her logic, men can get pregnant? Hmmm."
1.0,Lol Females are defined as having eggs and getting pregnant under the concept of mammals. You can do some sort of procedure to put eggs in men; but that is obviously not  a man anymore it's a cyborg.
2.0,Idiocracy was not supposed to be a documentary.
2.0,I didn't know her post meant every single leftist thinks this way. Hmm. 🤔 what an educated reddit post title.
1.0,"Anyone else feel like this whole gender thing is a bit of an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" type situation?"
1.0,Dang the libs need to go to a mental asylum
2.0,y'all Americans lmao
1.0,"Leftism is a truly disease, and a with a quick visit to the Front page of Reddit you can clearly see how badly it devastates brain function."
1.0,"I'm honestly not sure if they are humans anymore. Wondering if the report and the vaccines have anything to do with one another. Seems more likely Liberals are actually just aliens, body snatchers. The vaccine is the delivery mechanism.  


LOL. Please don't think I'm serious.  


But that's what it feels like."
1.0,I forgot which ivy league school did a study and found that 64% of those that consider themselves liberals have seen a doctor about mental health issues at least once.
2.0,What if a female doesn’t identify with the term woman but can still get pregnant?
2.0,"I'm pretty sure that in the human species ,the female is the only gender that can get pregnant."
2.0,"Wait, I don't understand. Someone please clarify.

Is she referring to Female -> Male trans people who still have the female sexual organs necessary to give birth? With the incomplete surgery techniques we have today, it is still possible to get pregnant after the surgery. Wouldn't they would fall into their own category instead of being called a traditional woman?

I don't know if that's what she means. Of course on the surface it looks completely ridiculous, but maybe the above is what she's thinking..?"
1.0,I never knew stupidity was contagious until I met a leftist and realized they are allowed to reproduce !
1.0,"I genuinely don't understand how a grown man can vote Democrat. I would rather be associated with *Qanon* or even Flat Earters, than with countless legions of people on the Left, take your pick."

Yeah this is a real struggle boys"
0.0,I’m going to demand my job give me paid ma’ pa’ ternity then! 😂
0.0,"so what are all of your plans for how long you're going to keep pretending to be surprised trans people exist?

fifteen years, twenty-five years? how long you think you can get out of this"
1.0,I think that person is referring to how people with different sexual identities can become pregnant. The lack of understanding of this could actually be construed as the brain disease.
2.0,"To Mrs. Gandy’s claim, this is true for male seahorses and perhaps some other species I’m not aware of, but this is not the case for humans.

  My guess is she’s using the scientific definition of gender while we’re using the legal definition which basically a polite way of saying sex."
1.0,"I'm not sure, because of the username, but I'm getting the sense that this is a troll. but maybe not? I'm not sure. The fact that we can't tell the difference tells you something about the left."
1.0,"Pretty sure it is a scientific fact--short of being an organism that can reproduce asexually--that only females can get pregnant.  Something about that being the rule for pretty much every species with males and females.  The left is nuts.  Just because you believe something, that doesn't make it fact.  It makes it your opinion.  Opinions are not facts and wishing them so will never make it true.

Being trans is fine if that's how a free individual wants to live.  I literally don't care.  However, it is completely false to claim that men can get pregnant.  It is their opinion that men can get pregnant because it is their opinion that men aren't defined by measurable biological sex characteristics.  Men cannot get pregnant.  Women who want to be men can."
1.0,"Ok I'll bite. 

Please tell me where the logic falls down.

If a women transitions to being a man, yet still had a uterus, then they can get pregnant and therefore an abortion.

I'm not trying to argue. Genuinely can't see what the point of disagreement is."
1.0,"I get the sneaking sense that that's actually the point of the post, and it's actually not a leftist post, but rather someone trolling the left. The fact that we can't even tell the difference shows how ridiculous the left has become."
1.0,"They are called birthing people now. Remember.
The word mother was not inclusive enough.
It also sickens me how so many people are so for infant murder."
2.0,Nope. Just the ones who will be getting the abortion. Full stop.
1.0,Brain damage from those vegan diets and getting vaccinated every two weeks for a virus that cannot be immunized. Pretty sure that's why they also want to be forced into totalitarian rule. Severe brain damage and extreme dependence on the teet of big government.
1.0,"Depends on your opinion.  We only believe in diversity of genitalia and race, not thought."
1.0,"Well... I'm with you but how about this?......   
  For the folks that say a woman can have an abortion if they want and a man has no say so, then the man should be able to decide whether he wants to pay child support or not!"
2.0,I think it's always been batshit. But so many people have access to the internet now. And stupidity breeds stupidity
1.0,"Imagine someone saying this just 10 years ago. I guarantee 99% of Democrats would think that this is fucking crazy. 

  
They are just so easily brainwashed."
1.0,Ever since we started having “fact checkers” which is like the Ministry of Truth in 1984
2.0,"The opposite of a fact would be a falsehood.


>  A lie is a statement made by one who does not believe it with the intention that someone else shall be led to believe it

Or something close to that at least.  "
1.0,Seeing people denying this biological fact makes me wish there was an actual way to change your biological sex at will so people will shut up about it.
2.0,"Well said, with little parenting they are in for a big surprise when they need to bring in income to pay living expenses. No more time to ""protest"" day and night when you have a 9-5 job to attend. my office hires recent college graduates, I have been there over 6 years now, more than ever we are denying candidates after the 1st day working interview. It may be coincidence but so far I see a trend of lazyiness and unwillingness to proactive"
2.0,She's referring to trans men who haven't got bottom surgery
1.0,"> The funny thing is that they are right. Transmascs and non-binary people with female genetalia can get pregnant. But watch how quick I get banned, because you don't care about the facts, all you care about is ""FuCk ThE LiBs""

They're not right.  Only women can become pregnant.  Men who pretend they are women are not women and can't become pregnant.  ""Non-binary"" is not a sex.  Humans are male or female.  Females can become pregnant, males cannot."
2.0,However English speakers born without ovaries can’t get pregnant. Lol
1.0,"I don’t think trans people don’t exist, I think they living a lie. 

You can’t simply change your gender and go against science and biology simple because your feeble reptilian brain “thinks” so.

I feel like a potato sometimes, doesn’t that mean I can identify as one and force my pronouns on others? No, because one you force others to say something, it’s not about respect and more about manipulation and force.

And back to transgenders, I believe everyone should live their life. If you wanna be XYZ behind closed doors go do so. But don’t make it my problem, and force yours views on me. I think everyone should love themself for who they are. 

Don’t even get me started on forcing kids to choose a gender. It’s stupid and pointless. If a child wants to do something, let them do it, unless it could permanently harm them or hurt them, like hormones. And let’s all agree that a 3 year old might not be able to count their fingers twice and get the same number, let alone choose what they want to be in life. If you were to ask a 3 year old what they wants to be when they grow up, they might say Spider-Man FFS."
2.0,I'm not surprised they exist. I'm surprised they're allowed out of the asylum.
2.0,"I'm guessin the whole transitioning part? I align with you but I understand the conservatism on this.

One has to understand that LGBTQ community is a part of world's culture not just America. It's a global community. One that can't be done away with."
2.0,"I had someone I work with comment on Facebook the exact sentiment of the op, unironically. Some really do think this."
1.0,I mean yeah.. The left is ridiculous... But the right is taking horse dewormer for a virus that doesn't exist....
1.0,So why do Cali libs care about Texas abortion laws then? 🤔
1.0,"I always see liberal media say ""What is the Republican Party's obsession with blue hair?"" and play dumb in the article, as if there couldn't be a more obvious indicator of political beliefs by the cookie cutter look that has evolved. It's funny. I have nothing against blue hair, I just think it's funny that obvious signaling is presented as a united front for those that support the politics behind it, and act like it's surprising that other people notice it."
2.0,"Back in my day, crazy hair and clothes were our way of rebelling against government and authority. Just like everything they steal it. Now to rebel I have to look normal. The future is stupid."
2.0,Like Trump's?
1.0,I’m pointing out the obvious hypocrisy of the left saying men can’t weigh in on abortion debate but also men can get pregnant.
2.0,Exactly. Before most people would just tell them to shut the fuck up. But now they find each other online and continue the echo chamber
1.0,XXY is sterile so don’t have to worry about abortions
1.0,"the term trans men its purely  a term I use to be polite , they are not men and never will be men  ..science"

We were given the paper ballots and told to fill in our choices with black sharpies, then slide the ballot into this machine that supposedly read the ballots.  The problem was, the sharpies were bleeding through the front-and-back ballots leaving numerous ""extra"" sharpie circles.  Several of us demanded new ballots that we would fill in with regular pens but were told NO, we had to do it their way.  There's no way that any ballot reader machine was getting the correct reading on those ballots.  This was in a top critical county that went Trump in 2016 that normally leans slightly left so no surprise they went out of their way to cheat."

2.0,"It’s the use of the term “horse de-wormer” that is fake. Per Merck’s website, ivermectin is to be used to treat the nematodes of a certain parasite in livestock and humans. Also per their website, “no scientific basis for potential therapeutic effect against covid 19 from pre-clinical studies. No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with covid 19. A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.” Merck is the company that created ivermectin."

2.0,"I guess that I am by definition a RINO given that I do vote Republican but only because they represent more of my positions than Democrats.  I'm pretty centrist politically speaking.  So, please pardon me if I'm not one of the folks this sub is supposed to be for.  But I just feel it necessary to point out how intellectually bizarre the rhetoric against Ivermectin is.

Now, I'm not an anti-vax guy.  I've had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine and have no problem getting a booster if it's necessary.  I was also one of the first people in my state to get COVID in March of last year.  But I respect everybody's choice about what to do with their own bodies.  I'm not taking a position against anyone's rights or decisions.  The point I'm making is solely to reveal what I believe to be an intellectual weakness in the anti-Ivermectin crowd's arguments.

The anti-Ivermectin crowd rails against it because it's ""not meant for humans"" and other similar arguments.  However, Ivermectin is FDA-approved for human use.  And do you know what is **not** FDA-approved?  **The vaccine.**  

So, here you have these people insulting your intelligence over the fact that some folks are taking a drug originally not meant for humans but that eventually became FDA-approved for human use and recognized as having legitimate, beneficial uses in humans.  But those same people are out there pushing crazy ideas like vaccine mandates and prison time if you don't get a substance shot into your arm that is **not** FDA-approved.  

I'm not usually one to just lay into somebody and call them dumb, but in this case, I think it's safe to say that many of these anti-Ivermectin people are, in fact, dumb.  At the very least, they fail to see the intellectual inconsistencies in their positions.  One can only assume that if those same people were diagnosed with a blood clotting disorder that they would refuse to allow a doctor to prescribe them Warfarin.  You know, since Warfarin is rat poison."
2.0,You may want to check Merck’s website in regards to ivermectin in regards to covid. They are the company that created ivermectin.

They gain power, maybe for selfish or selfless reasoning but it always ends up with them stuffing their pockets. 

How else you think things dimwitted democrats have such money? Pelosi is worth over $100m. She didn't get that by GIVING like they all say they want us to do. Big pharma and many, many other corporations pay them off. They talk about being Sweden or Switzerland but that'll never happen when you run a poorly managed buisness where more money leaves what its ment for to go to pockets of assholery.

Look to the top 1% for funds. In return, bills and laws are passed that are more in line with corporations than in line with we the people. Our donations are petty and not enough for them. 

Our founding fathers warned us of a two party system. Its destroying our country.  Last time this country came together was/2001. There was no hate against race, religion and sex within America against  each other. that didn't matter. Now we cant even come together for a virus thats making millions of people sick making 10s of thousands of people die.

1.0,"The rest aren't, though, which is the whole point.  The whole ""get the vaccine"" crowd have pushed any vaccine you can get your hands on.  And they've been doing it since well before the Pfizer vaccine was approved, so the fact that it is approved now doesn't give them a leg to stand on.  They still pushed experimental substances that were not FDA-approved to be forced on people while using disgusting rhetoric against people who tried other experimental treatments.  It was always an intellectually dishonest position."

2.0,"I honestly don't think it is going to have much of an impact. I deal with hiring in Florida where the extra benefits were gone over 2 months ago, and it has only gotten more scarce. Way more scarce if I am honest.

I would assume it extends variably to the rest of the country, but only speaking for my area, the major problem seems to be key industries not recovering fully hold back others. The biggest one I hear from prospects  is childcare. Many childcare facilities that existed pre-covid don't exist now. And the ones that do charge significantly more than they did before, because supply is low and demand is high, so they can easily. Everyone knows childcare is expensive, but when it goes up 30 or 50 or 100% or more over a year, many of the people who were working just dont make sense anymore unless they get a raise or a different job, and thats IF you can find one that can and will take your money. Theres waiting lists everywhere for childcare.

There's been a return somewhat to having a stay at home mom or dad in many families because working where they worked before is now negative money. Our economy has been used to having more adults in the labor force, as opposed to a single household earner. A return to that in any significant percentage easily continues the trend we are in now. Low supply and crazy demand."

Trying to find work in the IT field with no experience is tough though."

1.0,"This is not the time to spike the football.  Unemployment benefits are a smokescreen wedge issue that Democrats are going to use to climb back over the ledge that Afghanistan, COVID and the economy pushed them off.  The campaign ads write themselves: ""Republicans want people off benefits so they can go back to the jobs that are in demand: servile, demeaning unskilled labor that keep people in a cycle of poverty for generations.""  Instead of letting the clock run out, maybe conservatives should have come together to push policy that expanded the middle class.  That way, when Democrats did block it (because it has Republican names on it), they would have to eat more shit at the ballot box.  Instead, our guys handed them a W, it's fucking retarded."

At first, yes, of course, these benefits were needed and wholesomely welcomed.

Maybe some of these people already had this golem in them and these benefits just fed into it more. Maybe some of these people were hard workers and developed this golem because of the hardy benefits. Whatever this case, the government should be held accountable for this, but they won’t."

But what about the single moms with a bad ex. No family in the area or they have jobs to go to. So they can’t watch the children. She is soul provider and she was an essential work. Kids couldn’t go daycare because it was closed. But she has to pay the bills?  Daycare closes and the other places are either full or can’t expand. So mom starts staying at home.

The thing is, with those people, they keep using the argument of “we have the ability to provide for everyone without working, so why do we have to work?” The problem is, the only way you can provide for someone who doesn’t work is to have someone else provide that work. Someone has to work to build that house you’re living in. Someone has to work to hunt and gather that food you are eating. Someone has to work to research, create, manufacture, assemble, and deliver that iPhone to you. Someone has to work to keep the cell towers and satellites operating so you can continue to browse Instagram and tik tok. Someone has to work to provide you your avocado toast. Someone has to work in order for you to go to college and learn about gender studies and medieval romance literature.

1.0,"Exactly.  That's an effective and obvious conservative Republican policy that has popular support, and stopping it makes Democrats look like monsters.  That could've been a piece of a larger proposal, and even if it was shot down, just the idea of actually getting it done would lead to another red tide in the midterms."
2.0,There are 9 million jobs to fill and 7 million people losing COVID unemployment. 9-7= 2 million more jobs than people. I assume people will choose a higher paying job over a lesser one (all things being equal). Therefore for the lowest paid jobs - you are still going to have staffing issues.
2.0,"No I realize that… it was unfortunate for many, but I also know while they milked the system till the last day the country had reopened long ago and businesses were begging people to come back. Again, 10 million jobs available and no these are not all minimum wage jobs with low hours… so… yeah I get it some people deserved help, a lot of people also worked the system."

2.0,"If you spent anytime on , then it obviously was not enough to get the idea. None of the iphone scroling, social media browsing, avocado toast eating, gender studies major members of the sub (or any other like minded people) expect the world to continue on running if everybody in the world decided it was time to retire. People are tired of the working conditions and expectations that have developed, and have finally discovered their worth as employees, People want to be able to survive and be happy without having to kill themselves working 70 hours a week. Even people working 40 expect to make a reasonable wage and be valued as employees. People want to be able to retire comfortably without having a $100k salary their whole life. People want to work to live, not live to work. None of these expectations equal no work at all, everyone knows work is necessary, and it is perfectly reasonable for some of us to complain about it. 

Sidenote: The Right has had a significant problem with understanding the meaning of phrases built out of 2-3 words."

1.0,"> Since covid and andrew yang the voices for universal basic income have multiplied in all countries not just the us of a.

The problem of course, is that the math doesn't work on UBI, and never has.  If you're a fan of science fiction, I strongly recommend the Honor Harrington series by David Weber.  It touches a bit on how that works out if you go down that route.

Financially you are only worth what someone else is willing to pay you. You don’t get to determine your own financial worth. Otherwise, I’d determine my financial worth to be $10 Unfortunately, I don’t have any skills that are worth $10 therefore no one values my financial worth at $10  

> People want to be able to survive and be happy without having to kill themselves working 70 hours a week. 

Then get a new job. If working 70 hrs a week is not paying for your needs, you either need to reduce your expenses or get a higher paying job. A few years ago I was making I didn’t like making that little money. I decided I wanted to make more money. I went on google and looked up high paying jobs. I found one area  that was high paying that I was relatively interested in, and I googled what qualifications I needed to get one of those jobs. For this specific job, it was a specific college degree. Now it doesn’t have to be a college degree, for some high paying jobs it could be trade school, a software coding boot camp, a certification program, etc. But for this specific job, it was a specific college degree. I then decided to go to school to get this degree. It sucked, and between school and my job I was putting in 70-90 depending on the week. I had no life whatsoever for 4 years, and like I said, it sucked. But it was totally worth it. I now work in the industry that I had originally researched. 

If you aren’t satisfied with the pay for your current job, you need to get a higher paying job. In order to get a higher paying job, you need to acquire a skillset that people will be willing to pay you money for. Like I said above, this doesn’t have to be school, as school can be expensive. However, there are plenty of affordable ways to attend school, and I am perfectly happy to share these with you (or anyone else) if you care, and I would love to help. Regardless, trade schools and certification programs can also be great ways to increase your skillset.

I can somewhat relate to many if these topics, because i changed workplaces during lockdown for a job that sounded less prestigious on paper, but pay was significantly better, more time off, more benefits, less micromanagement, less pressure ""from above"". And that functions quite as well.

Everything essential for living could be provided to an individual but work would still absolutely be required. In fact it would no longer be optional at all. when services are provided for free what incentive is there to do it? I don't know how many people would work in a warehouse for free and the same goes for teachers, doctors, surgeons. These are absolutely essential positions that now need to be assigned rather than staffed voluntarily. You can't just not pay these people.

You can advocate for a higher wages thats fine, but removing or severely reducing salary *(Which would absolutely be necessary in a gov. controlled scenario)* has dire consequences. This is why the USSR had so many problems. Magnitogorsk is a prime example. So many people died in that industrial hell hole due to the sever lack of any real experience since they just assigned random people to work in the mines & foundries. I mean imagine being told to work as an ER tech with no option to leave or find another job else where.

Agree with u again, financial worth isn’t decided by you, it’s decided by the people paying you, and companies make less money the more they pay their employees. No one should be working for an unliveable wage, and since minimum wage hasn’t exactly continued to be proportional to the cost of living, many people ARE working for less than their worth.

No, its economic.  The amount Yang was talking about was $1000 per month, and Yang was talking about getting people off welfare by moving them to UBI.  Very few people can live off $12,000 per year, so they'd still need to have another source of income.  Nobody would voluntarily switch from welfare to UBI - they make far more on welfare - and if forced, they would riot.  So we're talking about UBI *in addition to* welfare.

> And with 2. has it been calculated before?

328 million people times $1000 per month is $4 trillion per year - which just happens to be about the same as our total Federal revenues.  It would leave nothing left to pay for the rest of government.  Even getting rid of welfare would just reduce the amount of programs you can't pay for.

2.0,"I would argue that it’s better to hold real assets (eg house) during an economic crash rather than having the cash. During a crash there will be inflation, so your cash will be worth less, but a house will still have inherent value. Please share your thoughts on this because I’m not sure if this is correct."
1.0,Seems like an issue with business owners and not the employees. Maybe they should pay those that live hear a wage that’s livable and they won’t have to hire illegal immigrants?
2.0,"What, no North Korea?"
2.0,These are all the countries that supported them against the US for the last 20 yrs- gave them weapons etc
2.0,The most disturbing part of this announcement is that one of those countries is in NATO.  UGH!
2.0,"Fantastic.

Ensuring the next inevitable conflict with the Taliban will immediately escalate to WWIII."
2.0,add North Korea to the list and the enemy side of WW3 has been filled
1.0,"You could have stopped funding Pakistan a long time ago. You can still introduce sanctions against them. Forget reforming Shariah states, Islamism has infiltrated the American govt in the form of Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. Pakistani and Palestinian lobbyists have politicians from both sides in their pockets. Your campuses, academia,media  and the Democratic party are all cheerleaders and enablers of Islamic radicals. Things like hijab and burkha are promoted by feminists and mainstream media. Gay men support states like Palestine which would happily kill them. How do the hell can all of this be reversed by sticking to ""democratic principles"" and ""natural rights""."
2.0,Did we want an end to American involvement in Afghanistan or not? Trump wanted to get out of Afghanistan and while it would have been more competently handled there's no reason to believe the Taliban wouldn't hqve eventually taken over. Absent American air power the Afghan Army was always going to be useless.
1.0,"China the foe , will take and hold Afghanistan now, the USA has lost its geological mastery ,thanks to Biden"
1.0,"One wonders if the American collapse really was foolishness  , or perhaps something worse , Biden has links to China thought Hunter? its very convenient all that expensive equipment was left behind, if the though the militarily is expert at ordered withdrawals , and we all know Afghanistan is basically a huge gold mine resources wise , why is America leaving all that too enemies? Biden is bought and paid for as are the democrats"
2.0,Next month they'll be welcomed into the UN...
2.0,"Nope, they are two worried getting through the second anniversary of COVID."

2.0,Surprised Cuba is not one of them
0.0,"Best buds all in a conference. It’s crazy tho, especially China since they have Chinese Muslims in concentration camps…."
2.0,"Seriously, who cares about Afghanistan. Americans need to focus on the Americas. There are problems here that need our collective attention instead of sounding the bullhorn on anything Afghanistan. The news cycle hardly mentioned Afghanistan in the past 20 years, we should continue that and keep them off our news cycle moving forward."

2.0,"Good point.   
But why didn’t Obama pull out after OBL was executed ten years ago?   


Oh hell, why do birds suddenly appear 

every time 

you are near?"
2.0,I did. I think the focus in this tweet is how the Taliban are explicitly showing who they consider their allies.
2.0,"To be fair, China negotiated rights to the 3rd largest copper mine on earth (which happens to be in Afghanistan) during the Bush years. But it wasn't until recently (2021) that they got the rights to develop the newly discovered massive lithium deposits there."
1.0,"To be fair, the American left have supported them since about 2002."
2.0,"Pakistan for sure. My source? Me. I was there. Plenty of evidence Pakistan supports the Taliban. They put them in power in 1996, after all."
2.0,It depends where they export their terrorism to
2.0,Ever since that military coup. They should have to get re added to NATO.
2.0,"China is doing what they should be doing , creating wealth and gaining power for their nation, my problem is the globalists quislings in the west (which includes constatives AKA rhinos ),  are not opposing  behavior that might lead to China being in total control of the worlds industrial capacity  , at which point they will have us over barrel  , and will take for revenge for the ""Century of humiliation"", they have not forgotten or forgiven"
1.0,"Look at Chinas trade balances its awful all one way , its going cause wars if things continue like that"
2.0,"No will risk warefar between superpowers over a possible threat of terrorism originating in Afghanistan. Look at Syria both Russia, turkey, and the US have soldiers there and are contesting the area, Isis is still in Syria yet no war between Russia and US has broken our."
1.0,"I hate to say it, but they already are the leader in industry and most manufacturing. Where do you think most batteries come from? Where is a large majority of manufacturing for almost all consumer goods. The US is China's useful idiot. We consume, and therefore fill their pockets. If we aren't already over the barrel, they've at least set it out and readied the chains."
2.0,"Yep. It would basically be as if we had an exiled king living in NYC that was a criminal to another country (oops, we did that)."
2.0,"Definitely don't think nuclear war will happen. However I do have to agree with the other guy to a point. Something is going to happen. What it is no one knows for certain. All I can say is I recently stopped laughing at ""dooms day preppers"" and got me and my family  a damn good bug out bag."
1.0,"true but things can  always get worse , we could start diversifying imports and lessen the problem,  Trump was doing that, which is probably the  main reason ""they"" deposed him, China has way too many people in is pocket"
2.0,It’s just going to another chess piece on the international chessboard of geopolitics. I don’t think it’s anywhere near as dangerous of a flashpoint of conflict as other ongoing problems across the world
0.0,"Oh I can almost promise it's only going to get worse. They were threatened by Trump's opposition to China, that's why he had to go at all costs. Buckle up!"
1.0,"its funny the amount of people that still think politics its about ideology , well it is for the political junkies and activists I gues,  but senior politicians  ..ha no, its about money and power,  , except for Trump he was the real deal . love him or lothe him"
2.0,There will be a lot of cool people in the gulag tho
2.0,"We will go where there is inequality and we will murder, steal, and oppress until we get it."
1.0,"I don't know where she got the idea that they wanted us in gulags.  I mean, three different Bernie staffers in different states said on video they wanted to put us in gulags if he won, and Bernie didn't fire them... but I can't imagine why anyone would think that."
1.0,I love how they never seem to learn from history.  This imagery is eerily similar to a Nazi propaganda poster “Tod der Lüge” depicting the arm of National Socalism strangling a snake.  Good to see they aren’t denying their roots.
1.0,"The problem is if Republicans somehow by the Grace of God get an upper hand, you won't be ruthless. You continue to want to be the good guy and allow these people to remain. This stuff needs to be stamped out. Marxists and Islamists need to be rounded up and purged from society. Their grip on media and academia needs to be loosened. You can't continue to allow these ideologies to fester because there is no middle ground with them."
1.0,"Woke radical millenials. They don't have jobs, live at home,  ps5 and social media until 3 am, sleep until noon, don't understand world issues /politics...but the flag looks cool, if I get it I'm cool...Pathetic."
2.0,"They won't be putting anyone in gulags, because they'll be dead."
2.0,"But we were told that equality isn’t the goal. Now it’s equity. So this flag is unjust and anyone flying it is promoting inequity in America, the most oppressive nation known to history."
1.0,"And its funny how if we changed a pride flag for example we would be bashed for it and ""canceled"". such hypocrits"
2.0,We’re gonna get crunk at the gulags.
2.0,"If we all go in the gulag, then that chocks up to the biggest party ever!"
2.0,Don’t really think it’s a millennial at this point. Probably a gen z such as myself. Being left is common for people my age. The pockets of people who lean right know to keep their mouths shut in school as to not cause trouble. I made that mistake freshman year and got yelled at for hate speech against a trans student when I didn’t even know they were trans as they hadn’t looked like they changed appearance wise.
1.0,Fucking capitalist communists.
1.0,"Do these liberal/ left students really have a grasp on the issues, in the world view? Idt they understand the importance of National Border Energy independence/ security, Afghanistan, etc. Most of the younger people I know (my sons ages), either don't really care about the issues OR they follow the herd and lean left because friends, actors, musicians etc tell then that's what to be?"

2.0,And they supposably want to hand out another 2k to almost everyone. What good is giving away money if it's worthless because of the inevitable hyper uncrease in inflation.
1.0,"It's stealing from those of us with savings rather than debt, and those who are retired.  So as usual, punishing success and rewarding failure."
2.0,"How is this stealing from those with savings and the retired?? Seniors will be taken care of in this bill, and I understand the ultra wealthy will be a tax break.. these are good things right?"
2.0,"When the government spends this massive an amount of money, they are borrowing or conjuring up money in some way.  Those dollars now compete with our dollars in the market for the same goods.  Supply of money is up, demand for goods is up due to government spending, leading to of the dollars in people's savings and retirement funds.   Those in or near retirement are typically on fixed incomes or invested in less volatile, lower return assets such that they can't keep up with high inflation.  Those in the workforce and earlier in thier investing years are invested in riskier assets who's return is more likely keep up with inflation and in theory their wages rise with inflation (in theory...). In any case, every dollar you have is worth less, and every dollar you have borrowed and spent is also worth less.  Reducing your effective debt if you're in the red, but harming your savings if you are not.

The ultra wealthy primary have money in corporations whos assets and value are pretty well hedged against inflation.  It won't harm them, it'll mostly harm middle to upper-middle class."
1.0,"So, what is the avenue of change that limits our government from the u.s. dollar? Government spending and tax breaks for the ultra rich seems to be a problem that we have to deal with.  Spending money on needles wars that go to the military industrial complex seems to be a moot point in all this. How can we get rid of special interests stealing from normal folks? Do we not target corporate interests in how they do business in the U.S. and beyond? Shall we make folks like Bezos and Musk pay more taxes to offset this spiral?"
2.0,"If you took 200 billion from Bezos and just handed it out to all US citizens, it would be about $600 per person, one-time.  It wouldn't change anything drastically.  The scale of government spending is so far beyond the ultra wealthy it's obscene.  My point is the ultra wealthy are not the problem or the solution.  They're an inevitable result of a global economy in my view.  They aren't necessarily evil or good, but one thing that's pretty universal is that they have changed the world on a global scale.

The exception to the above being when special interests and lobbyists are pushing policy not in our best interest with billionaire dollars driving policy.  We used to call that corruption or at least a conflict of interest or ethics violation.

I have no idea how to fix it, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, so hold my beer:

1) Remove the power and money from DC by drastically decreasing federal spending and returning power to the states.  I'm thinking decentralization of this power makes it harder to corrupt and more accountable to the people.

2) Cryptocurrency may be a game changer.  I'm sure with its own set of unforseen consequences.


I don't know what the numbers are currently, but Biden was proposing something like 10 trillion in spending over the coming years.  For my household, of which, I'm the only income earner, if we naively just divide 10 trillion by 330 million citizens, then multiple by the number in my household, that's about 150,000 the government is spending of my earnings, on my behalf.  The reality is worse, because the bottom 50% aren't effectively paying federal income tax (though of course they pay other taxes).  I'm sorry, I have better things to spend on than supporting bloated, inefficient government.  That's only proposed new federal spending, I already pay property tax, sales tax, gas tax (presumably for 'infrastructure'), local income tax, state income tax, medicare, social security, and the corporate taxes, etc built into the good we buy.

All things considered, the bureaucrats are probably really close to controlling more of the wealth we produce than we are.  I am not against all taxes, but the way I see it the bureaucracy in DC is effectively a parasite which is bleeding us dry with debt and wasteful spending.  I don't know where all that money goes, but I'm certain obscene amounts are being wasted or even being spent on causes directly opposed to the interests of the citizens paying for this mess."

1.0,"Fauci was well aware that specific research into bat cornovirus was taking place at the Wuhan Virology Institute. He specifically approved funding of this type of research. Yet, early in the pandemic he pushed the line that the virus spontaneously popped up in a wet market in the same frigging city where they were studying this specific thing. 

He knew, he lied, and he may very well have been the cause of the entire massive catastrophe that COVID19 and will forever be.  It's not a stretch to make this claim. 

It is entirely possible that the man who was instrumental causing the deaths of over 4.5 million people and the loss of trillions of dollars in economic activity is in fact the same man that is being celebrated as a hero by people like Trevor Noah, John Oliver and others. In fact, there appears to be solid evidence to this.

Someone needs to ask him why he pushed the story that COVID 19 developed in nature when he was very well aware that research into that specific type of very unique virus was being funded by the NIH in the city where the virus originated."

2.0,I suspect a great deal is getting revealed when teachers watch their children's online classes.  The level of indoctrination occurring in these classrooms is beyond the pale.
2.0,"? I have all sorts of flags that I put up depending on what we are learning. Don’t tread on me… Soviet Union … nazi flag… Texas independence flag …. 

I feel like this is half a story. What other things were in the room ? I’m guessing a US flag and all sorts of things the parente approve of. And heaven forbid the teacher have some sort of activity where the kids have to self reflect on their own beliefs. 

I’m sad to watch republicanism become the party of censorship and identifying “wrong think” so many of us talk about the participation trophy ruining achievement (it did) but here we are. Angry cus someone doesn’t do something the way you want. 
 

I hear “indoctrination” all the time but really What that means is people want kids indoctrinated with THEIR viewpoints. Heaven forbid a kid is introduced to Both perspectives. 
Tax paid classroom. Pls. Taxes paid for the 4 walls. The teacher paid for everything else in the damn room.

That being said - if the T really just used this as a preaching block, they can preach on the street corner. I’d have to see their curriculum and lessons to really know though."

2.0,There's an endless number of businesses looking for employees. People should have been getting a job long before.
1.0,"7 million people that sat around for a year.  Who wants to hire that lazy sack.  Millions busted their asses through the entire pandemic and made less money than the people leeching off our tax dollars.  In 9 months that will be an additional 7 million people on welfare.  With high wages, increased taxes, huge inflation on cost of goods all because of the current Marxist, authoritarian regime running this country, how many jobs will be around in a couple of months with 7 million people earning less than what they received in handouts.  Don’t forget to add rent to the equation.  The moratorium is over.  I hope I’m wrong, but I have a negative outlook on this economy."
1.0,"Yeah, Amazon is always hiring billions of people!  Stores are paying $20.00 an hour for unskilled labor.  How can 7 million  people be so lazy and still be able to sleep at night?"
1.0,"> 7 million people that sat around for a year. Who wants to hire that lazy sack. 

This is something I said early on.  If I'm a hiring manager and someone comes in looking for a job who last worked in February 2020, they had better have an explanation other than ""Unemployment paid more than working"" for why, or I won't touch them with a 10 foot pole."
1.0,"How could anyone hire someone that hasn’t workforce a year and a half?  I can’t imagine how demotivated an individual that literally did nothing for 18 months.  How will they wake up every morning ready to go to work?  

What I love most is the complete 180 the unions took to defend union members that do not want to take the vaccine.  The teachers union spent over a year telling the public how vaccines and masks are the key to open schools, now they want to fight against vaccine mandates.

These leftist clowns always implode on their own policies and ideology.  Defund the police , no don’t fund the police.  We need vaccines, no vaccine mandate.  1996 Biden, we need to lock up these animals, 2021 Biden, institutional racism.  Turn of the 20th century Democrats, Jim Crow laws and KKK, 1960s Democrats welfare, 2020s Democrats equity and everything is racist.  Nothing they say is true.  It’s all rhetoric.  They don’t even believe the BS they are pandering to the poor.  They are Marxist, authoritarian  and now cultural imperialist by controlling how will live, what to believe and censorship.  It’s all party first and centralize power to a federal , single party system.

They don’t want anyone to have their individual freedom or the right to pursuit happiness.  They want people on government programs.  Those in the middle get to pay for it because any bit of success is due to systemic racism."

1.0,"I want to push back in the idea that the Dems are outright hemorrhaging minorities.  I think it's important to qualify what's going on here with minorities starting to vote republican. 

Let's look at the 2020 election. The Trump campaign made significant investments in reaching specific minority communities eg. Tejanos in TX, American Indians in NC, and black men in general.

With the first two, the Trump campaign used messaging that spoke specifically  to those groups. Acknowledging their history, and issues specific to them. In contrast the Dems reached out to those groups as members of the ""BIPOC"" Community. The idea of BIPOC people as a group was created by the left and is defined by their ""shared oppression"". This allowed Trump to win groups which republicans never won.

Trump was able to blunt the Dem edge with black men both through his personal appeal and superior messaging. Saying, if I'm president the economy will be so good you can get rich. But again the Dems just lumped them under the BIPOC label and told them if you like trump you're not black.

In conclusion Trump was able to either blunt the Dem edge or win outright with specific minority groups by tailoring messaging for those groups and giving them an optimistic as opposed to a pessimistic message.  The takeaway is that Trump's approach is replicable and useful, but requires significant investments in crafting proper messaging and finding the right groups to target."
2.0,Biden recently put some visa restriction on people involved in the current genocide against the Tirgray and Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia. There's currently debate around a house resolution(H.R 445) to formally condemn Ethiopia and Eretria for genocide and crimes against humanity. Pompeo and Inhofe are lobbying on behalf of the Ethiopian and Eritrean government in opposition to Biden and most of congress.
1.0,"Great question. Sorry for not including information (this is something that is practically common knowledge in my circle - apologies)

See [

Also Twitter is a good metric as well [ 

Currently there is 0 coverage from MSM - in fact any coverage is anti-Ethiopia pro-interventionist (akin to Libya).

Here are some sources to why I thanked Senator Jim Inhofe & Sec. Pompeo.

* [Jim Inhofe](
* [Mike Pompeo]("
2.0,"The sad fact is that the narrative of ""Tigray Genocide""  has successfully reached the international audience, despite the facts on the ground.

* Cause of war was the Nov 4th attack by the TPLF (Tigray People's Liberation Front) - the ousted former ruling party of Ethiopia for over 30 years (BAD DUDES).
* Amharas have been ethnically cleansed from many areas  (Wollega, Mai Kadra, Chena, Agmasa, etc...)
* TPLF using Child Soldiers to continue their crusade in Afar & Amhara regions.

Yet TPLF has rebranded it's name (in name only) to TDF)and cries genocide while killing civilians of all ethnicities (Crocodile tears). 

In Ethiopia, there are 80+ ethnicities. Yet, TPLF (The Tigray Rebels) are literally the only faction which is actually using ethnicity as a target - yet you probably don't hear these narratives."
2.0,The MSM has [posted]( about the atrocities committed in Ethiopia.
1.0,"I haven't came across this NPR article - thanks for correcting my hyperbole.

Most outlets that reaches our circle Amnesty International, CNN, NYTimes, BBC, & The Telegraph has reported one sided stories that coverup or sympathize with the TPLF (the aggressor) by appealing to their ethnic base despite them even targeting their own who disagree.

Let me just give you a glimpse to what I'm referring to:

* NYTimes + Senator Coons makeup stories to blame the Ethiopian PM as cause.
   * [
* The Telegraph jumping through hoops to blame Ethiopians of Genocide.
   * [

There is so so so much more - if you know an Ethiopian talk to them and they'll tell you. At the moment MSM isn't reporting the facts (at best cherry picking & downplaying). I'll be doing my best to TLDR the series of events - I'm just one dude trying to clear the misinformation.

Seriously talk to an Ethiopian. Ask them about news coverage. Ask them about the Democratic Party & Biden. If what I say is a lie you'll see it reflected in their words.

Promise I'll centralize all the info. Currently, misdeeds are lost in Tweets & Local News - this shit is much deeper than they tell you."
1.0,I have a coworker who’s not from Ethiopia but her parents are. The way she tells it is that it started out as basically a group wanting their own freedom and then the bigger government coming in and squashing the attempts. So the little guys started taking hostages and killing civilians Vietnam style and then big government started ethnic cleansing. Basically just sounds fucked up all around.
2.0,"Unfortunately, you'll hear 2 stories and it's mostly divided on ethnic lines and allegiance.

If they're from Tigray (most likely but not universal) will tell you that story you shared.

Ethiopia has 80+ Ethnicities, but one political group (from Tigray) is trying to make a comeback after being ousted from power - after 30 years of being the ruling party. The TPLF is not a small guy - it's literally a political group that has used Racism to divide Ethiopia.

TPLF's aim is to make itself look like the good guy using it's operatives across the world. They are a rich & extremely corrupt group that got the boot due to a popular uprising.

Democracy has emerged; and ethno nationalism (their bread & butter) is under threat.

Imagine having the US dividing states based on ethnic lines (like This is for Whites Only, This is for Blacks Only, etc...) That's who they are... racism is a political opinion in their mind :)

Here's a joke

* Republican talks about race... they're a racist
* TPLF kills, borders & imprisons based on race... they're a fledgling democracy
* ^ That truly happened (Susan Rice & Barack Obama said that) ["

I understand why my opinion may not matter to you, because this is your country, not mine. And I respect that. I have always respected Americans for their patriotism.

It's also absolutely fine to discuss different opinions. Mine, for instance, is that an American president should be more mindful of his behavior. Yours may be different.

2.0,"Yeah,  because it's not like there were blockades and checkpoints preventing Americans from leaving right?"
2.0,Another thing I forgot to add. Shooting through a closed door isn’t the same as a police officer defending congressmen as they evacuate the building. Seems like we have slightly different views but I really appreciate you keeping it light as opposed to immediately name calling and cursing like a lot of folks do

2.0,Just because I don’t believe the same thing you do doesn’t make me a liberal. You’re welcome to review my comment history I’m on here a lot. I just keep call out people the few times I feel it’s necessary
2.0,"The blockades that prevented Americans from getting through were at the airport gate and staffed by the US military.

What is preventing 6 planeloads of people - including Americans - from leaving right now, is the US State Department."
2.0,Case law has been consistent - until the aggressor is actually on the other side of a doorway and capable of presenting real imminent threat - it's not justified to shoot
1.0,"Except there were in fact no congressmen in the building - it had already been emptied when this happened

Recall that AOC was in a completely different building - later claiming she had to hide in her bathroom because people were going to her - even though there was absolutely no one there"

2.0,">   The initial critique was a still image,  which in sure you'll agree are extremely easily taken out of context

To

> To critique the comment you brought in additional evidence 

So you both want to dismiss the image for having no context, then whine about someone introducing additional context? That's... an interesting take.

> you brought in additional evidence that was not part of the initial argument, moving the goal posts.

Kudos for showing you can read but not comprehend, and are so lacking understanding that you think introducing evidence in a debate is a logical fallacy. That's absolutely precious."
2.0,"I just rewatched the video again. 



I’m not going to pretend I have any knowledge whatsoever about case law or anything castle doctrine. I’m just a guy on Reddit. 

What I see is a justified shooting. Since the officer was cleared of the shooting I’m guessing others thought that as well."
2.0,"This is a statement from Chief of Police following that day 

“As protesters were forcing their way toward the House Chamber where Members of Congress were sheltering in place, a sworn USCP employee discharged their service weapon, striking an adult female.  Medical assistance was rendered immediately, and the female was transported to the hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries.  She has been identified as Ashli Babbitt.”"
2.0,Yeah I do know about the AOC thing. But I’m under the impression that there were a few reps In the “gallery of House of Representatives” is that not in the same building?
2.0,"This isn't castle doctrine related - the only issue in situation like this is whether the cop had a legitimate fear for IMMINENT death or great bodily harm - in the process or climbing through a window isn't there yet - imminence doesn't accrue until the person is on your side of the door and in a position to cause imminent harm

Officer was ""cleared"" of the shooting by the Capitol Hill police - of course he was

That's like the Chicago Police having initially cleared the dumbass who illegally shot that Laquan McDonald buffoon"
0.0,What threat did an unarmed woman pose to an armed secret service officer. He could have fired a warning shot or he could have moved to arrest her when she came through the window. There was also a swat team at babits rear coming up the stairs which I imagine had contact via radio with the shooter. You can see them signal eachother with a thumbs up after the shot
2.0,"The standard CYA statement - like the CPD tried in the McDonald (and a lot of other) cases

They were ""sheltering in place"" in a completely OTHER building - video that was shown of the chamber at the time shows it was empty"
2.0,"> in the process or climbing through a window isn't there yet - imminence doesn't accrue until the person is on your side of the door and in a position to cause imminent harm

Particularly given that there was a second door between them."
2.0,"People who’s job is to decide whether lethal force or not is authorized chose to acquit the officer. I’m going to side with them. 

You also just used the exact same argument that the loved ones of Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, and countless others have used. Did you defend them the same way?"

2.0,"Yes I agree, and I don't like it.

That being said, it's been far easier for me as a nuclear advocate to convince a right winger to support nuclear power than to have a left winger support nuclear.

The left bludgeoned the right with emotional appeal and NIMBYism to shut down our stance on nuclear in the general public, meaning that the only options left if you knew solar and wind wouldn't do anything would be to either be silent and keep voting... Or throw your hands in the air. It's so easy to bring right wing republicans who don't believe in climate change back to believing in reasonable stances on environmentalism as long as A) it's incremental and B) you validate their concerns. Same thing I've done with most topics.

And, to be honest, if the right says don't spend money and not solve the problem, and the left says spend more money on something that won't solve the problem... I think not spending money is still a better option.

It's so irritating if you look at it and see how the the nuclear regulatory commission called a lot of the anti nuclear attacks ""leftist trash"" all the way back in the 80s. If they let us keep going we would have been like France and this wouldn't have been an issue."
2.0,"As a hard left winger, yeah yeah I know, not supposed to post, I actually agree with your stance on nuclear and also support nuclear power. I really think the energy generation stuff is a problem on both sides... with dumb republicans talking about bringing back coal as a major energy source, and dumb people on my side shutting down ideas like nuclear as efficient ways of generating clean energy.

The problem with don't spend money and don't solve the problem is no steps are being made towards solving the problem. Not saying spending money is great, but it can at least create progress to a solution if well managed.

Now whether you think the left can manage it well is of course a valid concern... I also believe government is wasteful and stupid in many situations after all."
2.0,"To be fair, I’m somewhat left leaning and super into nuclear.  It’s not a lost cause.  I actually find a lot of the older more conservative men who don’t know much about nuclear are the ones still quite nervous about it!"
2.0,"Hey man, in this polarized time I'm happy to find common ground. One of my best friends since I moved to GA is a traditional auth left guy, and when we have to talk politics that's our common ground we loop back to.

It is true both sides have their derps, we just need to reel them in. I remember being 'shut down' by someone on the left calling me a climate change denier because I said renewables can't fill our energy needs.

And I get that nothing is being done if you do nothing... But sometimes if you're given two shitty options I'd rather we do the least shitty one. 

As an example, let's say we told two people to each pick up a cinder block and carry it 100m east. If one person is fiddling with the block and then walking 30m south, and the other is kind of sitting there... That would mean the person sitting there is putting us in a better position.  That's how I view it; if we spend ungodly sums of money in renewable tech that won't solve the problem were essentially wasting money. Don't get me wrong, I think the gov should be, in general, supporting tech advancements... But we need to prioritize. If we took half the renewable funds and gave it to the scientists and engineers trying to make  nuclear stations cheaper or faster to construct, it would have actually made a dent.

Cheers to finding common ground, from a right winger to a left winger!"
1.0,"Not to keep pointing fingers back and forth, but the resistance to nuclear power really is a primarily left-wing phenomenon in politics. The sooner we all get behind it though, the better!"

2.0,"Yep, you guys just also have to work on your older conservative ally’s that really only have poor knowledge of the (mostly man made) disasters of the past.  People like me will work the left. 
Most libs I know are in favour of a *diverse* energy economy.  More wind, yes. More solar, yes. Nuclear additions, yes. nationally refined oil products, yes.  Not everyone left wing is ultra progressive, just like not everyone right wing is alt-right extreme. There’s a middle ground somewhere with a lot of overlap on these issues."
2.0,"In the documentaries I’ve watched, the ‘major’ accidents have been due to negligence.   I’m definitely open to links citing otherwise, however, it’s my understanding that Chernobyl for example was a direct result of plant management ignoring power source protocols and straight up causing an avoidable disaster (trying to cover it up obviously didn’t help) and 3 mile island for another example, was the result of a leak that was not registered by any sort of sensor or properly maintained and was an entirely avoidable incident in itself as well.  Sadly, communication technology wasn’t at the level it has been at for the last couple decades to lead to faster, more experienced troubleshooting either.  Both examples are tragic and damaging to the psyche, but, when studied, the argument of how dangerous they are lessens as the argument for human error grows."
2.0,"Exactly. I was literally just watching a Chernobyl technical documentary last night and it explained what happened and why. The engineers allowed the nuclear reactor to enter an unstable state without realizing what had happened, and then had pulled too many control rods out causing the reactor to overheat and explode"

1.0,"A key aspect to a happy world is harmony. Harmony consists everybody. Harmony is influential. Happiness is influential. Those two things don't exist in the overall human race because of a lot of set backs. One key thing that divides the human race is the difference in ethics. Good ethics or morals are principles that contribute to Good conduct and good conduct is a positive influence that contribute to harmony. Good ethics should be universal around the earth just like a smile generally means happiness around earth.

Here's the thing. Besides all the crime and misery that contribute to this sick world that has it's negative influence, you also have loose morals (let's say loose conduct for better understanding) and loose conduct has it's negative influence. Example, parents that regularly curse around their kids might influence their kids even if they tell them not to do it. Homosexuality, is, loose, conduct. It has it's influence as you can clearly see around you in today's world. It, contributes, negatively, to, humanity. How?

Homosexuality challenges the importance of ethics, logic and reasoning. Three common things you need for wisdom and Three common things that are challenged in committing crimes like murder, domestic violence, rape etc.. When you challenge those things in regards to the ethics of sexuality, it attacks the meaning of ethics in general and attacks the human cognition like, 'if I could do this I could do even more' which could lead to recklessness. It also attacks the meaning on quality of life, like how a person experiences life. Influence effects your motivations and your mental and physical wellbeing, and it's contagious because it effects you and everyone else.

So how is homosexuality truly beneficial to those doing it and to humanity? The world is like a family household, if one thing is out of place, everything is. So we all have a part on contributing to earth and humanity, it's best to be in harmony not disarray. But this world won't be in harmony with loose conduct, that's one key reason why the world is the way it is today.

Some might say that we sent our former family members into battle with the best technology and resources available and they would be partly right.  But our true strength has always resided in our steadfast faith in God.  Our belief that our cause was just and that it was by God’s hand that we would prevail.  

Let us renew that trust and faith and accept the promise of help in dark times.   Let us unleash the greatest power in creation and call upon our creator to help us in the shadow of what seems to be the death of our Republic.  One nation under God and in God we trust is the cornerstone of this nation. 

And so on Wednesday, July 8th let all God loving members of the American family and across the globe unite in prayer that first begins by acknowledging that without Jesus Christ we can do nothing and with Jesus Christ all things are possible for His glory. That in our own words we ask for guidance and direction to do our part in restoring the founding principals of this nation.  And if inclined to do so, share those prayers with others by posting on YouTube.   (Please share this message)"

How pathetic that in the era of information we're still falling pray to poorly written, out-dated, evidence lacking, illliterature. This is why the U.S. gets so much flak, because we're a broken nation and the root of it is religion i.e, lack of reason, sheer stubbornness. Put down the gosh darn books and put your morality on the front line and ask yourselves aside from your ignorant ideologies, why you feel entitled to spout your bullshit on the gay and lesbian community as if it holds any weight? You people are too far gone for even Asclepius to heal... I feel as stupid as those I speak of for even entertaining their asinine beliefs.

2.0,"The Supreme Court consists of nine justices, each one was UN-ELECTED by the people and serve life time tenures. Let me check my memory and I see there was another government entity in the last millennium  that was also UN-ELECTED and served for their entire life, that’s right, a KING. History tells us what our founding fathers thought of such a government entity when they gave King George V a big “F  you” when they signed the Declaration of Independence. Today we have  a Supreme Court that is governing just like a king, using judicial decrees to make law, a form of judicial activism that has no legitimate place in the highest court of the land. If the Supreme Court wants to become a political entity of our three branches of government, of which in my opinion they have firmly established with their recent rulings, then they should be subject to the same process as the other two branches, the legislative and executive, and that is an ELECTION. No longer should Supreme Court justices be nominated by the president and then approved by the senate. These justices should be elected by the people through a national election, like any other political entity in a DEMOCRACY."

I deserved a smack really, but I absolutely know that if I’d been less well educated I’d have signed the statement and ended up in trouble, and can’t imagine what kind of hell I’d have landed in had I been anything other that white & middle class.

Looked up this guy. He is currently a fugitive from justice because it tried to interfere with a trial in Washington state by acting as the defendents attorney despite not having a law license.  He and his wife have fled to Mexico where our ambassador says he is behaving like a spoiled brat because he picks and chooses what laws of theirs he will obey. He insists their cops speak to him in English, he won't observe their Covid19 rules because he doesn't believe in Covid19. Oh yeah he believes in conspiracy theories and is a Libertarian."

2.0,"I'm proud to say i did something similar. I followed a speeding canine unit concerned that it was driving erratically and posing a  danger to other motorists without any lights blaring, and he finally pulled over. A young cop emerged and looked at my ID and asked me why i was following him. I said, ""you were going 100 and cutting people off with no lights."" I also said, ""You are the worst driver i've ever seen."" He let me go and as far as i could see he drove more carefully after that."
0.0,This was a great video. I like how this gentleman questioned the officer with a very strong knowledge of the use of unmarked vehicles. This is actually how a actual cop should approach a vehicle. They should walk up and say “do you know why I pulled you over” without drawn gun. Then they explain why. This doesn’t happen in the videos I have seen with violence. The cops assume you are a criminal and don’t tell the person what they have or may have done. It’s your a criminal and I am judging you.

I'd have called up a photo on my phone of Michaelangelo's Sistine Chapel frescoes as soon as he invoked the name of God. For devout Michaelangelo, the purest expression of divinity is found in the perfection of the naked human form. Unfortunately, the leaders of the Catholic Church were even more uptight about nudity than this guy: they commissioned other artists to paint clothes over the original figures nudity."
2.0,"When I was a kid some gigantically fat, gross woman told me I had to leave a public pool because I was upsetting young children because of my leg (I am an amputee). She even put her hands on me to physically force me to leave the pool area, at which point the life guards (and letter the police) got involved. 
     Never mind that I had every right to use the pool and had paid to be there.
     Also, I have been an amputee for 48 years now (since I was 3) and yea, little kids are sometimes scared, but mostly they are curious. If I can talk to them (always with parents permission) they stop being scared right away.
     When I worked at a resort I was swimming laps on my day off when I saw a little girl, about 4 with my fake leg trying to give it to her terrified looking dad.
    The kid was German and was trying to tell her dad, ""Daddy, someone for got their leg. You need to find them and give it back before they fall over.""
    Dad was thinking, ""Oh god, my kid has found someone's prosthetic leg and is playing with it. What should I say if the owner sees this?""
    Well his nightmare had come true. The owner had seen it, but thought it was hella funny.
    Though the child spoke only German, and I spoke only English the father, once he realized I was not upset was happy to translate.
     I was able to tell the child about my leg through her father. The kid was extremely sweet. After I explained about my leg and got her to put it back, she said something and patted my head (I was in the pool at this point) that caused her dad to laugh. She had said, ""You poor man. Not only is your leg gone, you can't even talk.""
     I have a huge amount of experience with children. It doesn't hurt them to see disabled people."

2.0,I have watched this pandemic since in began and doctors have said how it tricks people because they naturally get better for a couple of days and then they go down hill fast.......Has Rogan been 'well' for sometime now or only a couple of days?
2.0,"Please Ana, by all means go talk to him on his show line Cenk did. Engage in a healthy disagreement that may educate how both sides think about it. You debated Tomi Lahren. Why not just be a guest? Not a bad idea for some attention to both points of view."
2.0,"I listened to a couple episodes of Joe Rogan's podcast a couple months ago while at work. Wanted to see what all the hype around this guy was. I really only knew him from the sitcom ""Newsradio"" and ""Fear Factor"", time killers on NBC back in the day. So I listened, and his interviews where serviceable, and he had no great insight into anything with his commentary. Like most of his show was pleasant enough background, but the level his listeners think he's so smart and the $100 million dollar is baffling. Like he wasn't even a good entertainer really. Like Rush Limbaugh was a horrible man, but his show could be entertaining, and he was a brilliant broadcaster, if not a great commentator who would often say horrific things. However he could stretch nothing into hours of content. Rogan doesn't even have that going for him. So, basically, I don't get this guy at all. However, on a larger scale, he has gotten dangerous and Spotify needs to pull his contract."
1.0,Joe is endlessly disappointing and really chosen to go down the path of the rightwing grifter in order to make even more money than he already has...
2.0,Was he vaccinated
2.0,"Either way he got better WITHOUT THE VACCINE !!!............And weren't they telling people that antibiotics just don't work at all in the beginning ??? So, there's no need in even thinking about taking'em....

So why does he need intervention?  It’s just a cold isn’t it? 

He accidentally shown that deep, deep down, he doesn’t believe it."

2.0,"The real problem with Ivermectin is that it only cost about 2 cents a pill…
along with vitamin D (study after study has shown the lower your vitamin D status the harder this virus hits you) there is simply no money to be made.
Shame on you TYT for not doing your job as journalists and buying into the world of big pharma
the WHO says Ivermectin is one of the safest drugs on the planet and could easily be given out to people waiting for a vaccine…the problem is tho if you give people cheap drugs and they get the virus and don't get that sick, they might feel like they don’t need the vaccine…only money to lose if you promote something cheap, even if it “helps”
You say that there are no studies…let me ask you this, if you were sick how ethical would it be to withhold a medication that might save your life? Would you participate in such a study?

What day will it happen? Today? Tomorrow? 

One hundred and fifty thousand people die every day. How many of them were ready?

When you stand before God on that day will you go to heaven or hell? 

Jesus Christ tells us that unless you’re born again you will not see the kingdom of God. You will be judged for your sins; all of the lies, the immoral thoughts, stealing, blaspheming and justly sentenced to hell.

But you don’t have to go to hell. Jesus Christ tells us that whosoever repents of their sins and trusts in him can be saved. Jesus paid the penalty of your sins on the cross at Calvary two thousands years ago. 

What sin is worth an eternity in hell? Think how precious your eyes are to you, what would it take to sell your eyes? And how much for valuable the soul that looks out of those eyes? Don’t go to hell, repent and trust in Jesus and be saved."

0.0,"Have we been watching the same Joe Rogan? I have no idea how anyone could have ever thought that he had more than perhaps an eighth of a brain. He has never asked an intelligent question on his show. He just asks his stupid questions in an engaging way, and makes it painfully obvious that he doesn't understand why his controversial guests are controversial. Then his smart guests are just good at taking his stupid questions and giving interesting responses, anyway. He has ALWAYS been the Donald Trump of interviews. He just leverages his confidence and name recognition to convince unknowledgeable people that he is competent and get them to follow him through a kind of unfounded hero worship."

2.0,Take care TYT !! Jo is suing CNN & only right. TYT next !!!
2.0,I'm sure it was the horse meds and not all the other shit he took that was actually proper meds for covid. lol
2.0,I would of been a little more on board with the ivermectin claim until he mentioned the doctor who prescribed it. I forget the name of the group the doctor is part of I think it's Frontline c19 doctors or some crap but the get major kick backs. Doctors can be bad people too.
2.0,If you listened to his podcast you might have heard him say he already had his medical treatment in place if he caught covid. That wasn't panicking. As for the vaccine it is not a cure all. Evidence now points to it offsetting the worst effects of covid but you will need a booster 6 months after your second vaccination given it is now proven that it's efficacy drops to 40% after that initial period
2.0,Lol why you piss off at him for his own opinion. His body his choice . Not like your beloved vaccine does anything to treat the virus. In fact the virus is not even deadly enough to spend this much effort to deal with.

I don't like this reference but they called Texas the Western version of China in the US. I doubt the state would even notice Portland at all.

What day will it happen? Today? Tomorrow? 

One hundred and fifty thousand people die every day. How many of them were ready?

When you stand before God on that day will you go to heaven or hell? 

Jesus Christ tells us that unless you’re born again you will not see the kingdom of God. You will be judged for your sins; all of the lies, the immoral thoughts, stealing, blaspheming and justly sentenced to hell.

But you don’t have to go to hell. Jesus Christ tells us that whosoever repents of their sins and trusts in him can be saved. Jesus paid the penalty of your sins on the cross at Calvary two thousands years ago. 

What sin is worth an eternity in hell? Think how precious your eyes are to you, what would it take to sell your eyes? And how much for valuable the soul that looks out of those eyes? Don’t go to hell, repent and trust in Jesus and be saved."

1.0,What I am witnessing everyday is extremely bothering. Folks having so much fear won't even take off a mask while outside although the CDC indicated those vaccinated can. Once we lose faith in the air we breathe we are deeply at a lost . Never chose to wear a mask outside since mask wearing became prevalent nor have any interest in taking a vaccination. Are we forgetting the power of our own immunity system. I cherish the sciences as well as a healthy lifestyle. The immunity systems will fight off anything if we took care of ourselves accordingly. Stop allowing your system to turn into a garbage disposal. Take time to do some form of exercise.

1.0,"I don't know where Sarah Palin went to school, but she is clearly a bonafide genius. This woman's intellect is off the charts. Her intuition is unparalleled and her wisdom is a joy. Her boobs look great too, for a woman her age."
2.0,"On 6 Jan 2021 the Congress was discussing the possibility of an illegal election. Before the 1st protested state, Arizona, had the full evidence of the irregularities exposed... a fully orchestrated, illegal, domestic terrorist backed riot took place in the Capitol. The intent of the ""deep state"" was realized when the riot stopped the legitimate debate on the issue at hand. Congress was evacuated and the debate stopped. The Capitol was cleared of rioters, and later that evening, Congress returned and, as expected, the fire for finding the problem had burned out, as the ""deep state"" planned it. There are videos of Capitol Police waving the protestors onto the Capitol lawn and into the building. According to some, facial recognition software has identified ""Antifa"" members in the rioting crowd. As they did in the summer riots, normally peaceful people were antagonized by the anti fascists and followed along. The end result was attained... justifying the means. Debate stopped and Biden was certified by unchallenged slates of electoral votes. The Georgia challenge and the few challenges that came afterward received overwhelming votes against and the electoral protest procedure was halted in tis tracks. Not unexpectedly, there were soon calls from the left for V.P. Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the POTUS... and if he doesn't agree, we will start impeachment proceedings. The ""deep state"" has tried for 4 years to remove Donald J. Trump from office an they will not stop... even 12 days before the end of his term. ""He is dangerous!"", they say. ""He incited a riot!"", they say. The truth is, that with the intelligence that he still has access to... he is a threat to their illegal livelihood and has been for 4 years. It scares them to death that their truths may be revealed. For the left and the deep state, it is truly a matter of life and death to remove Trump. As Hillary Clinton said, (paraphrased), ""If that S.O.B. gets elected, we'll all hang by nooses."" Truer words were never spoken. Donald Trump was not as vindictive as he should have been, and he allowed them to slide. BIG MISTAKE!!!! A majority of the left and a goodly portion of the right are involved in enriching themselves from activities that are surely less than above board in the USA. They all fear the consequences. Some would surely face death for their crimes. We can only pray that justice will be served."

2.0,In 7 to 10 minutes the criminal is finished doing his damage and is now skipping merrily down the street to find his next victim.
2.0,"The Democrats shot them selves in the foot when the riots were going on they cried ""defund the police"" and a single breath later. ""We need more gun control"". ""Turn in your AR 15s"". The events of 2020 is the reason we got the AR 15. Less police, more crime, and take your guns away. What is wrong with their logic."

0.0,Nobody needs an AR15 to defend themselves.  There is no need to have a weapon which can hold upto 25 rounds of ammunition and fire off that ammunition ina automatic mode.  All pushing to have households to be allowed to have weapons means that households are going to absolutely need them.  The only beneficiaries to this are the ultra wealthy who can have their own armed guards and the weapons companies.  The rest of the country suffers.

Plus, I can't rely on the police since y'all idiots keep blocking the streets as you riot and protest the same police you want me to call in an emergency. No thanks, I'll stick with my guns and not have to worry about calling the police."
2.0,Who do you need to be protected from if you don't have guns? Just buy a stungun on amazon.
1.0,"Criminals by nature don't five a F about the law. Make guns illegal and only the criminals will have them. I'd like to think these anti 2A people have a sinister agenda, but knowing many of them, most of them are deeply naive and unfortunately stupid. And then there are those with an agenda. We have 2A exclusively for ""them""."

1.0,Brainwashed a smart person to get USSR results.  Apparently method still works. Senator Boxer former california “representing” California called for all gun owners to voluntarily turn in weapons.  She made a BIG deal in media coverage of putting her guns into pile.  ... later it was discovered she kept UNREGISTERED guns at home. This man was brainwashed.  So defund police is next step in his future or stand up to defend his American rights under constitution. Which will it be?  He has right to abdicate but should respect everybody else’s right to protect themselves OR head off to China for more intense indoctrination and loss of all his finances under great reset - China leads world in use of social media to control everyone.  First rule down that path is disarm population. Communists ALWAYS do that. So do dictators.

2.0,"This was an official, on the record, approved by NATO deal to get rid of a corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine! Viktor Shokin refused to press corruption charges against the previous administration, TWO YEARS before Hunter Biden was offered the job at Burisma. He may not have been experienced, but he is well educated, and I would very much like someone to show me a pay stub, because I am curious about how much they paid to regain respectability. 

That’s what they thought they were getting, after the Ukrainian Revolution, and the removal of the previous corrupt government and the former owner of Burisma. The Ukrainians are desperately fighting for their independence from Russia and its influence. They mistakenly thought it would look good to hire the USVP’s son. That’s all there is to that."

His “Hurricane Katrina Sniper Story” was contradicted by both Army Lieutenant General Russell Honore and the United States Special Operations Command.

Mr. Kyle’s “Punching Jesse Ventura Story” was contradicted by the Coronado Police, while his “Texas Car Jacking Story” was contradicted by both the Johnson County Sheriff and the Johnson County District Attorney.

Considering the trove of fabricated stories told by Chris Kyle that have been discredited by both military and law enforcement personnel, it is highly likely that many of the stories contained in Mr. Kyle’s book also have been fabricated, either partially or totally."

2.0,I don't believe it's possible to understand war without training and serving to save your life and other's lives. On top of that there are lessons only historical studies can teach us and that takes years. People are too innocent to understand war and I think that's a good thing but there's a lot of work left to do here and abroad and ignorance is no excuse.

I watched and thought it was an excellent movie that gave many of us just a little hint of what he and ALL the others who served over there had to deal with...
The hardest part for me,  was the tail end when suddenly you hear what starts out like TAPS ,  then flows into the beautiful closing theme,  Along with  the LONG FUNERAL procession  coming down the Interstate with all the LIGHTS  &  FLAG bearing Bikes driving down through the Hundreds of people lined up alongside the highway  & the bridges in the rain to pay their respects to a true American🇺🇸Hero ;  And I was in tears,  and then the picture of COWBOY  STADIUM where HUNDREDS were gathered to say goodbye...

1.0,"Actually, the offended cancel culture babies have taken something away from the Native American by denying them tributes to their ancestry. Those titles of teams as respectful and honorable. It is a shame the Indian nation did not see it that way and come in defense of the team and themselves.  This isn't the first time this has happened. The cancel culture couldn't care less if the native American dropped out of sight into obscurity and eventual extinction.  
Shame on the native Americans for not speaking out in defense of themselves."
2.0,"Redskins is racism towards native Americans apparently. 
Imagine if a team was named “Black skins” people would be offended and call it racism towards black people. 
If a team was called White skins people would say it’s white supremacy. Funny how that works"

0.0,Breaking news: Native Americans are able to have varying opinions. I too am a Native American and I am against Native mascots in areas where Natives are a minority. I shockingly have the audacity not to speak for other people so yes there are Natives who aren't offended and yes there are Natives who are against Native mascots. I don't know who needs to hear this but Native people don't get together and decide a collective opinion and then the rest of us have to follow it.
2.0,"The Redskins can avoid the racist charge by changing their mascot to a Redskin Potato! :-)

Many teams have aggressive names: the Bears, the Bengals (tigers), the Eagles, etc.  In a similar vein, the name Redskin was chosen because American Indians were viewed as tough warriors.  It was really intended as a compliment.

The people claiming that Redskins is a racist term have not been able to find a single documented instance of the term Redskins being used in a derogatory manner since the 1920s.  It's doubtful there is single person alive who has heard the term Redskins used as a racial slur.  The meanings of a word sometimes changes and the word Redskins is one such word.  Redskin hasn't been a slur in at least a century."
1.0,See they don’t care it’s just white liberals taking away heritage
2.0,Isn't it racist to change the name and logo? Change the color red also
2.0,Gary Clark of the Washington Redskins conducted at least 3 football camps at Native American reservations during his career. He wanted to know if they thought the Redskins name was racist. What he saw was Native Americans wearing Redskins gear and saying that they were proud to be a Redskin fan and the 5% that weren’t Redskins fans were Cowboys fans and that’s why they didn’t like the name.

There is still a problem with landlords justifying evictions and against the law causing people to move out within a day's notice and having their security deposits stolen. Landlords can continue to make security deposits over false notions and make people's lives worse. The houses are not necessarily being torn down. They're just converted. It would be nice if a studio apartment didn't cost more than you make at a minimum wage job that you have to walk to because you still can't afford a vehicle. Craziness.

And as anyone who's watched Fox knows, its fundamental message is rage at what liberals are doing to our country. Over the years the specific message has changed with the times — from terrorism to open borders to Benghazi to Christian cake bakers to critical race theory — but it's always about what liberal politicians are doing to cripple America, usually with a large dose of thinly veiled racism to give it emotional heft...

The Fox pipeline is pretty simple. Fox News stokes a constant sense of outrage among its base of viewers, largely by highlighting narratives of white resentment and threats to Christianity. This in turn forces Republican politicians to follow suit. It's a positive feedback loop that has no obvious braking system, and it's already radicalized the conservative base so much that most Republicans literally believe that elections are being stolen and democracy is all but dead if they don't take extreme action."" - Unknown"

Instead, they behave like the neighborhood bullies, arrogantly believing they can get away with any abuses of their neighbors, because of our military support. We shouldnt make ourselves a partner in this.

Unfortunately, that's basically how their current nation was built - by pushing, bullying, & forcing their way into the region, with so many offences committed, doubtful anyone wants to play nice with them, now... They have left themselves with no choice, except to annihilate their enemies, or be annihilated, & that is exactly how they behave - like all the Palestinians must be annihilated, all their land taken, in order for Israel to exist, at all. That is a corner they backed themselves into - when they showed no willingness to show compassion to their fellow humans, or seek out peace, thru diplomacy - always resorting to brute force to achieve purely selfish ends, instead of cultivating peaceful relations, in a land they reside in, thanks only to the concessions others have made, on their behalf. Perhaps a bit more humility, gratitude, & compassion would have resulted in a better outcome?"

1.0,"""Liberals, progressives, Democrats and other rational thinkers must accept one crucial reality if they are to save America's democracy: Those who live in the right-wing echo chamber really do believe what they are being told. Those beliefs are now extensions of their core identities...

And as anyone who's watched Fox knows, its fundamental message is rage at what liberals are doing to our country. Over the years the specific message has changed with the times — from terrorism to open borders to Benghazi to Christian cake bakers to critical race theory — but it's always about what liberal politicians are doing to cripple America, usually with a large dose of thinly veiled racism to give it emotional heft...

The Fox pipeline is pretty simple. Fox News stokes a constant sense of outrage among its base of viewers, largely by highlighting narratives of white resentment and threats to Christianity. This in turn forces Republican politicians to follow suit. It's a positive feedback loop that has no obvious braking system, and it's already radicalized the conservative base so much that most Republicans literally believe that elections are being stolen and democracy is all but dead if they don't take extreme action."" - Unknown"

Government is supposed to work for the people, not the super rich and not for big corporations."

The reason most other people vote for Republicans is that they are not Democrats. The working class can not be allowed to win.

Our government has a pay structure well-suited to the 1970's, but now it's simply too far behind the scale of what these folks could make in the private sector. A lot of people think we pay our elected officials too much, but the problem is that we don't pay them enough to not take lobbyist money."

There is no intention of the republicans agreeing to anything for the present, they are looking at the future. You can see that in what Trump is doing by supporting all these people in state positions dealing with elections, if the the elections in the future is very close. Your dealing with some very nasty, corrupt individuals, that will stop at nothing, to cheat to win. An example is the last Supreme Court judge that shows how evil they are. Again they have cheated in the past when they didn't have the votes and changed it to 50 votes to win. You never trust Moscow Mitch McConnell and you should know that by now. You want to do something positive, start getting the people in the Republican Party with all the criminal activity they have done in the last plus decade. Get them removed from office and put in prison if possible. There supporters don't care how corrupt Trump and the Republicans are. The more corrupt they are the better they like it. You saw who supports them and the type of people they are. It's going to be interesting how hard the punishment will be for the people that were arrested for the insurrection, who was involved in the planning, and weapons that were used to murder the people that lost their life and the type of injuries that caused their wounds. The intent was to do bodily harm to anyone in their way of the attack."

0.0,In my opinion these people aren’t Dems… they’re wolves in sheep’s clothing. I’ve said for years that that’s how they will infiltrate the party and then work to dismantle from the inside. They’re no more trustworthy than the Russians or the Chinese. They know full well that they can’t win the public vote fair and square and cheating is their go to method now.
2.0,"So if they already took the bribes, does that mean they’re locked in and have to vote against the common good? Their constituents need to bombard them with messages to move them to do the right thing, or else."

An example from ActTv post today re: Joe Manchin…In legislating when someone says let’s slow things down on this bill they mean “I want to kill it but I want to take the time to enjoy doing it.”😷🇺🇸"

No need for birth certificates there will now be Conception Identification with only a number until other information is obtained. Can a person legally not have a name? If not- you must be named as soon as conception is confirmed. As a zygote is now *life* a new *possible life* will likely be recognized. As such, male masturbation will be closely monitored and prohibited as it does not occur without external stimulation. Sex without procreative intent will be discouraged and you can bet birth control will be next to go. Any age restricted right will be measured from conception, obviously. The definition of life will need revision. Basic science and the seven characteristics of life no longer apply. So many nonliving things just became living. I’m not sure about this one but if the pregnancy or childbirth kills the mother doesn’t that make the person responsible the fetus? How would that work? Anyways- point is this whole idea is a stupid front for punishing and controlling women. You can bet that the rich will be getting abortions for their wives and the other poor women they knock up.

And white privilege  might exist, but the overly simplified heuristic that is used when discussing white privilege deeply flawed. One can't assume that just because  someone is white, they are automatically  privileged.

It ISN'T taking away or minimizing what those people are going through.  It is acknowledging race is one of the bigger levers in the equation."

2.0,"Cryptocurrencies have no legal basis.  The Constitution places sole authority over currency in Congress - not in Elon Musk, not in some mysterious Japanese man with his Chinese coin mining facility. 

Do you even know why we have devaluation in the dollar?  Do you know how fiat currency actually works and the global coordination of currency markets?  

We had moderate to mild inflation for several decades until Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1970, which crashed the economy throughout the 70s.  Yet, we still managed to have no carry over debt for programs - even Vietnam.  But in the 70s, we started borrowing money like crazy from Japan, to the point where  a minister of education suggested we cede Hawaii to them in exchange for writing off the debt. 

Carter used monetarism to increase inflation significantly which lowered the value of the dollar to repay the Japanese their dollar indexed funds.  This decrease the amount we owed them by billions of dollars.  Yes, stagflation: double digit interest rates, double digit inflation and double digit unemployment.  Short term pain (like 8 years) for long term gain of not carrying foreign debt. 

But Congress couldn't control its spending, and decided to leverage the funds in social security instead.  Throughout the 80s and 90s that's where we borrowed from thus increasing the total debt.  Various members of Congress then opined mightily about the impending crash of Social Security and that it should be privatized, like Chile did.  Except, Chile's program crashed and burned. 

We've been borrowing money for 40 years.   Mysterious, uncontrolled digital currency won't change anything other than create yet another ponzi scheme where the people who get in first, profit and the people who get in late lose money.   With no transparency and no accountability - that's what crypto is: it's a Ponzi scheme."

Of course do your own due diligence, I too wouldn't have suspected her until I started seeing references to this across many crypto news sites. I'm not saying that regulation doesn't need to be there, I'm just saying doomsayer democrats regarding cryptocurrencies will drive Republicans to take advantage of the narrative as being the ""free financial"" party. Granted, that's probably 10 to 20 years down the road, but politics is always a long game played like it's short."

0.0,"Anecdotal and a false equivalency.

Just because some people use it criminally does not make it inherently bad for the overall financial system. People money launder, commit fraud and cheat at the stock market all the time using USD fiat.

2.0,"I don't really care what percentage of democratic or republican I am. I don't subscribe to the idea that I need to be either or. Ultimately you impress upon me the validation for that, with that kind of gatekeeping rhetoric. 

What I am saying, is I watch historical trends and compare them to current events. It might not happen, but the current dialogue of in office political figures is that it's a growing concern and lines in the sand will soon be drawn. What Ultimately will help people who are pro crypto vote for a specific political party is where their stance on crypto is."
2.0,My concern is the backing. There isn't a treasury or standard backing the currency. Theoretically I see it as kids honoring monopoly money
2.0,"Firstly, I want to say thank you for being kind and respectful. I knew this post would be met with ire and aggressiveness. 

But to your point of backing, our current USD isn't backed by anything other than the trust and psychological agreedness that it equals x amount. Money is an arbitrary meaning just like lines in the dirt mean that a country, ""exists"" there. Granted, symbolism is EXTREMELY valuable. Symbolism has been used for great evil and great good. 

My point ultimately is, doomsayers leave room for others to take up the mantle as champions of the crypto space."
2.0,"That actually isn't correct.  The dollar is backed by the US Government.   It's fiat around the world with more than 20 countries that use it as their currency. 

As one of the dominant currencies in global currency baskets, mismoves by Congress or the Federal Reserve can have catastrophic global consequences.    

About crypto?  Who owns it?  Who oversees it?  Nobody  We see Elon Musk quite reliably pumping Dogecoin with a few weeks at the end of his fiscal quarter, and then dumping it a week after the books close.  

Bitcoin is heavily used by terrorists around the world for ransomware.  The mythical value is the anonymity, yet governments are showing success at seizing wallets used for crime.    Speaking of criminal terrorists, North Korea is one of the leading countries that use crypto for criminal activity.

If you lose all value in your crypto, the way it has happened to many people - who do you deal with to get partial indemnification or a refund?

Nobody.  Nobody.  This is exactly the model that caused multiple financial collapses in the United States from 1830 through 1880.  Five complete financial collapse, bank runs and depressions that lasted for years. 

Because of these collapses, we created the Federal Reserve to oversee currency and debt.  The closest we've come to a collapse was 2008 because of speculative investments.  Sound familiar?  That cost us more than $1 trillion to bring under control.

We have the FDC which exists to oversee financial institutions to protect consumers in the event of a collapse.  No crypto is FDC backed, meaning - a collapse in any crypto leaves it's investors without recourse, and no government backing means they'll never see a cent of it again.

That's why we don't support crypto  It's the subprime mortgage of financial instruments."
2.0,"My point exactly, USD is backed by the conglomerate agreedness that the US government will catch us if we fall. Just because USD is backed by the government doesn't make it's value any less psychological. 

If I say, my rock is more valuable because 1000 people find it valuable, does it make it any more valuable than the 500 people who think their rock has more value? Inherently no, because they both have psychological value not actually valuable. 

People made the same argument when we made the move away from gold backed USD. A new medium of exchange is necessary for a global economy to evolve. Using the empire of the United states of America as a basis for a financial system globally won't work forever."
2.0,"Unfortunately this is typical absolutism. The USD is run through every world nation and backed by 20 governments and trillions of dollars, and losses can be compensated.

Crypto *runs* based on wide psychological trust which you try to present as similar, but the scale is not even close. Further, Crypto is not backed by anybody. Lost wallets are not redeemed, stolen data, fraudulent exchanges can not be fought. When Bitcoin had its big early pop and exchanges promised to refund you in their shop's virtual currency rather than dollars, there was nothing you could do."
2.0,If nobody wanted to value the USD that'd be insane as economies would collapse but in the end the US Treasury would honor it. Not so with your rock.

0.0,"1.  Volunteer with your local chapter of the Democratic party.  Party planks and platforms are often written by the small number of people who bother to show up.  Having been involved with local democratic politics throughout my teens and early adulthood (I've had to stop since it's considered a conflict of interest with my current job) I can assure you, the people showing up are not always the people we want writing the party platform.  Most the people showing up have big financial interests in getting certain things done.  If we want democracy to work, we need to be more active in it.

2.  Vote in every election, especially at the local level.  The local level has huge influence on your day to day life, your vote carries more weight at the local level, and our next national level candidates have to get their start somewhere.  Voting in every election also means doing your homework.  Get to know the candidates.  For my most recent state delegate primary, I had a chance to talk with both the individuals on the ballot and got a solid feel for both.  It was clear the less funded guy was better to me, but he lost pretty decisively.  So few people do the homework so the woman with the slick mailers won.

3.  Run yourself.  As I already said, democracy only works if we work it.  If the people running aren't getting the job done, then someone else needs to step up.  And frankly, I'd rather vote for the reluctant candidate running to do the right thing than the person who really wants power.  I'm afraid of people who want power.

You'll notice my advice has nothing to do with this particular issue.  That's because if we don't get the foundation right, we will never be able to get the big stuff right.  It's all hard work I propose, no easy answers I fear."

That’s the way Afghanistan runs, plain and simple. Obama should’ve left right after Bin Laden was eliminated and disregard Bush’s rebuilding mission that wasn’t the reason why we went there in the first place. Democracy is something nations have to fully understand and embrace or it’ll fail. The struggle in Rome after the assassination of Julius Caesar boiled down to pro-monarchy versus the supporters of the Republic.

From the things you said you liked, you are def more Democrat as Republicans actively want all those to go away.they hate unions. Hate regulations. Hate employee protections. Want no min wage. Want no osha. Want people working more hours and less days off. Democrats don't like big govt they think the govt should be there to help people when they need it and protect people when they can. Gop uses that to con people into saying dems want to control our lives. Which is what they want to do while claiming they are getting govt off people backs. Whatever that means. They want high taxes for the middle and lower class and no taxes for the rich. And they are almost all rich themselves while the Democrats have alot of ppl that were part of the working class before getting elected."

1.0,"No it doesn't. Nor does it have to have ""exceptions for life of the mother"" either. The latter is the only possibly compelling exception and even then it falls flat on its face because in no other realm is failure to medically save (in this case the baby) applicable to murder. 

You cannot fail to save with malice aforethought and despite taking every reasonable action still murder the person. That's just nonsense because the malice aforethought part is contradictory to the actions trying to save another. Doctors aren't perfect and fail to save people all the time and it's not murder. So why would it be any different for the unborn child that you suggest abortion be legal so that they can be killed? It doesn't make sense. Either the child is going to die regardless what you do and you can save the mother, or the child lives and the mother lives.

So no, the law doesn't need to make any exceptions for this. If you murder the child, you should be punished. Period."

Plus if Harris gets 25thed into the white house between now and then, it's even worse because everybody will be coming out to stop her. That's why Biden only did the commission instead of just nominating new justices. Also Pelosi's commission isn't really moving very well. Even the social media platforms, facebook included are starting to regret propping up the democrats because now they want to come after them with regulations not to make them uphold free speech which they were afraid of under Trump, but to censor more than they can handle without hurting their bottom line.

1.0,"That is an interesting question and I think you are seeing the statements that conservatives typically make regarding individual liberty (i should be able to make my own decisions because I am free to do so, I just have to deal with the consequences of that decision) and relating it to this issue. Is that the case? I'm sorry if it isn't, that's just the connection that I see and would appreciate clarification if I'm incorrect. 
I think the distinction is that we regard the pregnant woman and the unborn baby as individuals with inherent value simply because they are human. That idea has ramifications. We believe both of those individuals have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. So because the baby is a living individual, it has a right to life and should be provided that as much as we are able. Additionally, the destruction of a life, which we would say begins at conception, at the hands of another is murder, which is something we believe is wrong.
I hope this helps. If you have any more questions or would like to discuss things more, feel free to dm me. I know I'm not always the best at clearly articulating my view, so I would be glad to discuss it further."

I agree that is important to listen to the opposing side. I find i often become arrogantly certain that I am absolutely correct when I either just think through it on my own or only listen to those that agree with me. But hearing the other side often adds perspective or brings up things that I didn't consider. This doesn't always change my position, but it helps me consider more aspects than I originally did which is important to having opinions about the world as a whole and how different things work together."
2.0,Murder of a human or murder of a fetus?
0.0,"I get that ""pro-life"" see life at conception, but why not also support adequate sex education and contraceptives instead of abstinence only to prevent unwanted pregnancies, and welfare to help these kids after they are born so the mother doesn't feel like she needs to abort because she has no future?"
2.0,Just murder. Or rape. Or any crime that should be punished. What is your basis for punishing crime in general?
1.0,"Thank you for your questions. As before I think those are important questions to ask especially since they can have a big impact on the lives of people involved. 
Would you expand on what sex education would look like? I think I would agree that sex education is important. I don't always agree with how it is put into practice (for example I live in a state that begins sex education in kindergarten. In my opinion that is far too early to begin discussing that topic). So if you clarify what you would desire in that regard, I could give you my opinion in that area. 
In regards to your point on abstinence verses other options, my personal belief is that sex is something reserved for marriage. In holding that view, I acknowledge that others do not hold that view. So I would hold abstinence as the ideal. That's what I believe people should do, but since they aren't going to, providing instruction in the other areas would be beneficial, but I would still emphasize the ideal. I don't believe contraceptives are wrong, I just don't think they are best before marriage. 
I think another reason abstinence is promoted over the other options is that no matter how effective the other options are, there is still a chance that it doesn't work, while with abstinence, it should be entirely effective because if you don't participate in the act that gets you pregnant, you can't get pregnant. Actions have consequences, if you do not want to be pregnant or to deal with a child, the most effective way to prevent that is to avoid participating in the activity that results in pregnancy. If you participate in that activity, you risk the result. 
I don't know that this specifically answers your questing, but one objection I personally would have to welfare being used as a solution is I don't believe it is the government's job to take care of children whose parents would struggle to provide for them. Instead I would say it is the responsibility of the people in that community to come alongside that mother and assist her in the provision and raising of that child. One of the ways this manifests is through charity like Pregnancy Resource Center and individuals seeing the need of that mother and child. 
If a person is truly holding to the pro-life view, they must continue to value the life of that child after they are born and so must be willing to do what it takes to protect that life. The child doesn't cease to be valuable as a human just because they have left the protection of their mother's womb.

Also, note that not all, but a lot of times when republicans disagree with stats its because there is a reason to besides they hurt my feelings. Like there are conflicting reports. Like a month or so ago when the CDC said Florida's daily covid death rates where through the roof, but come to find out the CDC had messed up the data and took a 3 day death total and displayed it as happening in 2 days. There were news articles proving this mistake, in that instance, yes republicans disagreed with stats because they were proven wrong.  


On that note I am giving you a chance to prove this wrong.  


But, while these links don't confirm these actual stats they do confirm the sentiment that the refugees from africa and the middle east are causing crime and rape problems in europe.

2.0,"You are right, in this statistic you need to take into account weather getting that statistic uses a general definition of rape or if it uses it's own countries law or definition of rape which it's actually surprising how laws differ extremely from country to country.

However even if their using the country of origins laws you would still have to wonder why Denmark has a low rape count? Do they have extremely strict laws or are they hiding their cases from us? Does Denmark stack up in comparison to other western countries(where the laws would be somewhat similar, obviously there would be some differences between them all) and would that show us something vastly different in comparison?

Also, if you were to look at the stat through a different lens like ""ohh well Denmark is just more civil"" or something of the sort then suddenly this has a vastly different meaning to what is presented as truth.

In other words, this statistic paints a pretty incomplete picture and it would help if it had something to drive the point home that wasn't itself."
2.0,"Or they just have less rapes in general. If you only have 2 rapes per 100,000 people, it would end up that you are arresting around 35% of them which is about twice as high as the rate of the US."

And to this fact, there is no arguing.  There are entire libraries filled with books about how statistics can be misleading and purposefully deceitful.  

To reiterate and be clear, I simply disagreed with the prevailing sentiment and pointed out that statistics can be misleading. I have not done research into this specific instance, and I don’t care to.

As far as statistics being misleading, I am not going to link a bunch of articles you probably won’t read."
2.0,Less reported rapes* or else the families honor is shot
2.0,"Yup, in their culture it's not rape, shouldn't be in the same graph. 

Also, we should most likely start going by their laws in order to be inclusive."
1.0,"Ok, so to be clear, I gave you an opportunity to defend your statement that this table is false. And you essentially refuse to take it, saying you don't care to research the topic and based on your edit only spoke up in defiance of the information because you want to mirror republican behavior.

But like I said, and proved, above. When we disagree we often have evidence to back it up. We don't disagree because the information provided hurt our feelings.

Also you say stats can be and are manipulated. I 100% agree with you. I have an example.

The other day I saw a news clip that said, ""vaccinated people have a 99.999% survival rate. Unvaccinated people are 25 times more likely to die"" that sounds drastic! 99.999% survival rate vs 25 times more likely to die... Let's do that math.

100 - 99.999 = 0.001 (chance of death while vaccinated)

0.001 x 25 = 0.025 (25 times more likely to die while unvaccinated)

100 - 0.025 = 99.975% chance of survival for unvaccinated people.

Yet people are losing careers over vaccine mandates... For a vaccine that doesn't prevent you from contracting or transmitting. It doesn't even prevent you from dying. For an experimental technology (mRNA) that has never gone past lab trials before this year so there is ZERO long term effect studies.

See when republicans reject things, we typically have logic and facts to justify our stance."
2.0,"No we shouldn't why should we placate a bunch of murdering, terrorist, rapists?"
0.0,"I was responding to a comment about statistics being xenophobic. I simply stated that was false and foolish and that statistics can be misleading.



Denmark is the fifth most safe country in the world, and while mainstream news admits there are issues in respect to this area,



The reality is that reporting lags behind. I don’t know the reason for this, but since under reporting is rampant, it makes sense that criminal convictions would follow suit.  Instead of blaming a minority, this article describes a traumatizing process as the major issue.



This article expands on how antiquated the laws are, specifically calling for changes to acquaintance rape, the most common type of rape.  

The statistics are misleading because people are using it push a false narrative which blames refugees coming from a particular locality. It fails to account for the realities of the law and the people living there.  In short, statistics are misleading, and some people in this community are pushing their own narrative instead of actually doing the legwork."

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation….

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.—That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness… it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.****"

The issue here is that this Lt. Colonel was not personally given an illegal order, so he had no grounds to disobey one.  At present, we don't know of any other instance where anyone involved was given an illegal order.  We know lots of **stupid** orders were given, but even so, not to this LTC.

Joe Biden blatantly put marines in danger, despite an abundance of military intelligence without a single doubt telling him exactly what is going to happen months before the Taliban even took Kabul. 

He blatantly disregarded intelligence, armed the Taliban to the teeth so when we inevitably go in next it will be a slaughter, and made one of the worst military decisions possibly any president has made. 

We abandoned our allies, are openly being disrespected across the world, and made this world a lot more dangerous of a place because of his immaturity. 

Or are we going to talk about the blatant disrespect for every dead service member brought home according to a barrage of witnesses’ and gold star families?  

This president is effectively the sole reason for tens of thousands of deaths and ensured many more to come in the future. 

Calling out this administration for the blatant disregard for human life is only right, if he faces jail time so be it, he did the right thing.

2.0,He could have resigned his commission as an officer and flapped his gums all day with no worries or repercussions - he didn't and violated the law
2.0,"So you think the only reason this was added to the declaration of independence is because Jefferson was only justifying their actions? I think it was more so those that came after them would know what should be done and create a legal path todo so. I'm sure no lawyer but it seems to be more than justification but a warning to be prepared for future tyranny.

I definitely agree with the love it or leave it part tho. I think more than a few need to have their citizenship revoked and sent out of the country and some should be held accountable for their actions that have lead to our current situation."
1.0,"What happened to the military officers like Alexander Vindman who not only criticized Trump, he lied under oath for a phony impeachment? He filed a false whistle-blower complaint claiming he heard the Ukraine phone call. He didn't. An Obama holdover Eric Ciara-mella heard the call and used Alexander Vindman as a phony witness. No charges were  given to Vindman even after he was caught lying."
2.0,"I am in the military and nothing restricts my speech off of duty hours or out of uniform. 

For commissioned officers it is indeed different. My point is there’s a different between morals and laws. 

He was have been limited by law in technically, but morally he had an obligation to defend the honor and the lives of the service members serving under him. 

Countlessly the president and other high appointed officials, military and not do things that are blatantly against the UCMJ and against the law. Almost never do they face repercussions, and even very little do they receive scrutiny, that is as long as it sides with the left viewpoint that almost every corporation sector  and power house in this country supports."
2.0,The reality of Military service
1.0,"Correct.  What immoral or unethical order was Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller given, that he had a duty to disobey?

Contrary to leftist belief, *not liking* the President or senior officers does not grant military personnel carte blanche to disobey their lawful orders or act disrespectfully toward them."
2.0,So you can tell the difference between President and commanding officer?
1.0,"There is no legal path to overthrow the government.

There is a constitutional system to create laws, judge them and amend the constitution. You should know that as a ""constitutional conservative"".

You advocate something else it's called sedition or treason against our constitutional republic. They make tall trees and short prices of rope for them folks."
2.0,Then he should have resigned his commission and then complained - citizen presidents don't get court martials bc their not soldiers - who was the last president some country didn't want tried for war crimes - they don't get a fcking opinion - nor does a commissioned officer - period
2.0,The UCMJ and code of conduct clearly restricts speech of any enlisted or commissioned officer in the military.  You might need a crash course on military law.
2.0,"No, abandoning our people and actively arming a terrorists organization is plenty of ammunition to question what the hell is going on.  If you can’t even admit that point, I don’t see a reason in continuing this conversation."
2.0,"Yeah like the the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of a military department who are also covered and who I assume probably had something to do with the withdrawal - it's getting sad now"
2.0,Do you personally believe the current president and his administration have become a danger to America?
2.0,So your saying the declaration of independence is nothing but paper or our constitution?
2.0,"Go ahead and look up the hatch act and DOD Directive 1344.10. 

The UCMJ directly states commissioned officers."
1.0,"> No, abandoning our people and actively arming a terrorists organization is plenty of ammunition to question what the hell is going on.

It absolutely is.  However, those don't relate to orders Lt. Colonel Scheller was given.

His first video was a violation of Article 88 of the UCMJ.  His second video was a violation of that, and arguably Article 94 also, because it included the statement  ""Follow me, and we will bring the whole [expletive] system down"".  The possible penalties for violation of Article 88 are dismissal, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for one year.  Article 94 has the potential to carry a death penalty.

Biden and the senior officers under his command did a lot of bad things, and they should all spend time in prison.  ...but what Scheller did was dumb."
2.0,"The declaration of independence was a document explaining why British citizens were overthrowing their government and included specific examples of abuses by the king to justify why they were doing it to gather support from other British subjects living in the colonies and other European powers.

The Constitution was created to create a new constitutional republic to replace a failing confederacy of states. It includes a blue print for how this government should operate and how it can be changed through constitutional amendments. All states ratified this through a vote making it the new law of the land.

The bill of rights were added later through the amendment process established in the constitution because it was the law of the land. 

There is no, we declared independence so you can legally do it whenever you want clause.

Again, you want a revolution prepare to get bloody. And if that's you intention, quit pussy footing around, declare you rebellion and get to fighting"
2.0,"Well the only thing evil need to spread is for good men to do nothing. 

I would rather find peaceful legal solution. However I won't choose doing nothing while evil destroys our country and the American way of life. 
My family had fought in every war this nation has ever been in from the 1st to the last. I won't be the one to change that. While it scares the hell out of me, I won't comply with what my heart tells me is wrong."
2.0,"So when does your declaration of independence get released. 

The colonists had 27 abuses and usurpations by the king to justify their treason. Let's start with the abuses and usurpations you feel the Constitutional Republic has completed against you."

1.0,so true. the USA should take note. ugh nvm we got Joe and the hoe running the circus.
0.0,"Sorry, but this data is completely made up.  Please check the government sites for Sweden and Israel for factual data.  Also, no country is currently on their 3rd shot of vaccine in other than critical care deployments.   This is just designed to rile people up and try to prove a point that isn’t supported by either measured fact or by critical reasoning.  Vaccines work.  Masks work.  Social distancing works.  The USA proved this was effective under both Trump and Biden.  Now we’re suffering again thanks to people spreading these lies.  Viruses mutate.  That’s why we get a different flu vaccine every year.  Covid mutated in the the more aggressive and dangerous Delta variant.  Now people with no defenses, folks who refuse to get vaccinated, are being hit hard.  This sucks and is completely avoidable.  How do I know this.  I’ve got two doctors in my family, both working ICUs.  Both watching people suffer and die.  Direct observation of fact.  Please get vaccinated and end this.

Edit:  As I noted in a follow up comment below, I was looking at the unvaccinated occurrence of infection, not the overall country rate.  But this also bought up the key difference in vaccination between Sweden and Israel.  Sweden is far more vaccinated than Israel is.  Hence lower  Hence relaxation of mask and social distancing.  Vaccinate and wear masks to help protect the unvaccinated."
2.0,The county we live in has nearly 100% vax participation and the R-eff has been 0.9 for almost two weeks. Mask mandates still in place...
1.0,I took a lot of heat on arguing that mask mandates don’t work. They’re quite a hive
0.0," boosters just started so that’s not relevant. 

Look at Sweden’s vaccination rate. Additionally because mask mandates don’t exist doesn’t mean people aren’t wearing masks and distancing because they are.  Nordics take community efforts seriously and usually don’t need to be mandated to do the right thing."
2.0,"This is really true data, and it’s not a bad two groups to pit against each other, they are both relatively small countries that are mostly homogenous racially, and the only true difference is claimed it (and I do wonder if that has anything to do with it, the Middle East is… Well, desert, and isn’t Sweden fairly cold?)"

2.0,"Sweden is also over 10x larger with a significantly higher income population and a similar population size, most of their mandates that restricted public crowding and enforced social distancing were lifted in mid-July. In terms of vaccination, Sweden is at about 60%, and while climate can affect viral transmission, it is likely in large part to Sweden's much lower population density that we see these numbers"

The statistic that’s missing here is the country wide vaccination rate.  Sweden is far ahead of Israel on that which is what’s driving their low case rate

1.0,"They were supposed to be, but it turns out the bigger the crowd of people that don't give a shit, the less reported cases there are. Anyone that got sick probably hung out at home and thought to themselves, "" well shit I'm sick "" then a few days later felt better just like 99% of everyone else that gets this.   They didn't go on national TV and talk about their positive test and how everyone should get vaccinated, so the news is not interested."

2.0,"Doctors have a duty to do no harm, if you wanted lots of pain killers that could stop your breathing and kill you, there’s a limit to what they will give since they can’t practice what would be literal suicide at that point. Also there are laws. In the case of a doctor won’t intubate or use resuscitative measures if you have that signed along with other treatment modalities you can chose to refuse. Plus depending on the drug many have drug-drug interactions that could either enhance or decrease the current efficacy of medications you’re on based on its metabolism. Lastly it’s for prevention of law suits. Let’s say you ask for a bunch of random medication and survive yet have side effects that cause permanent damage or require surgery or other things, now you’ll be suing the hospital. 

Lastly in the case of this tweets correlation doesn’t equal causation. Ivermectin is used to treat parasites. People are buying animal formulations and overdosing themselves, and the media is having a field day calling it medicine. Just like I’ve seen people struggling financially use animal antibiotics and getting deathly sick or using insulin doses for pets. Covid is a virus. Viruses aren’t alive. Just like antibiotics which work on bacteria wouldn’t help in this case, neither would anti fungal medication. 

I also don’t understand why the people who adamantly argue that this virus is a hoax or man made or not that serious and won’t get vaccinated or wear a mask suddenly feel so scared of it that they have to take ivermectin.  

Next thing you know, covid patients are gonna be asking for chemo and radiation to kill everything in their body."
2.0,"Yes, the hypocrite oath. Yes, assisted suicide is for the most part illegal in the US. I am familiar with DNRs, I used to be a paramedic and worked in a trauma center.

However, if I was in sound mind and sighed a liability waver or give power of attorney to a family member, thus relasing the attending physician of any and all legal liability prior to my contraction of ANY virus or illness, why not?  The virus is not a hoax but, my job allows me to view certain government materials. The last brief I read was that COVID spread was ""very unlikely"" to be spread naturally. ""More than likely"" leak out the lab, however not meant to be a bio agent. 

I do not believe any virus is a hoax, we have pictures of them. That was not my argument."
2.0,I mean I support the whole your body your choice thing. I’m only a 4th year medical student so I can’t speak from too much experience yet. I think if the person is willing to pay and like you said of sound mind and judgement and doesn’t hold anyone liable then by all means. But they shouldn’t then go and claim whatever worked for them as a miracle cure without further testing since there are many factors that go into play. And a sample size of 1 is meaningless.
2.0,"Much respect for being a med sudent!! We need more doctors in this country. You are a 4th year med student you can absolutely speak. Do not think you can not.

2.0,"So this is what I worry about… I’ve followed TYT for years, but recently they made a very convenient edit to videos from Jimmy Dore, regarding alleged sexual harassment towards Ana Kasparian. As I stated before, I’m not a fan of jimmy Dore at all, but his comments were about Kasparian being unprofessional with her work attire, and framing it as a joke. What he said was, “that’s a nice “news” skirt”—  They played a clip of Dore saying, (this is not verbatim) “i made her feel terrible, and ashamed… I did that” — then the clip stops and Cenk calls him a “monster”. Right after the clip cuts off, Dore finishes his comment by explaining how terrible it was that he made her feel that way, and then he apologized. 
—— with that said, I’m voting for Newsom, don’t like Elder, but I’m very curious about what he said after the clip stopped, because it was very abrupt. Elder doesn’t seem like he is advocating for paying slave owners reparations. The point he seems to be making is that it was legal to have slaves, so if reparations were paid out, an argument could be made for the slave owners receiving reparations as well. He didn’t sound like he was advocating for that, but just making a point on reparations as a whole. If I were to make a guess, he was making an argument against reparations, not making a point that slave owners should be paid as well."
0.0,A new low for Elder. Saying this to attract white votes is his style.  And there is Owens his female twin. Cali elect him and lookout. Whites want him to do the dirty work. Which he will gladly do. This all started with his hatred of his father. His own father.

1.0,"Yes, Reparations. Taking money from people who never owned slaves and giving it to people who never were slaves. 
What about white americans from the north whose ancestor probably died fighting to free the slaves? Or black people today whose ancestor's owned slaves? Or what about mixed racial people - would a black person with a white slave owner ancestor have to pay? What about a white person with a black slave ancestor, would they receive money? 
The rabbit hole of reparations makes no sense and is widely open for abuse and perpetuating resentment that should have died decades ago. That's Elders point. You're either too stupid to understand that or are deliberately misrepresenting him so you can smear him."

1.0,"The young turks are missing Mr. elders point all together. Intentionally. Mr. Elder is pointing out the absurdities one encounters when going down the rabbit hole of reparations.

Elder opened my eyes on the matter. Made me contemplate some important questions and consider things I had not considered. 

Would Rachel dolezal get reparations? Would Oprah Winfrey? Obama? Kamala Harris? When today there are FAR more poverty stricken white people in America than any other people. Do all black people get reparations even though many NEVER had relatives who were enslaved? What about those black people whose families were actually slave OWNERS? There were many. Who pays these reparations? All white people? All citizens whether they had anything to do with the slave trade or not? Republican families who sacrificed their own flesh and blood to liberate the slaves and end the infamous traffic? People whose families never even lived in the country until maybe 100 years after the infamous traffic of slavery had ended? They owe, too? The South was home to 250,000 free blacks. Do their descendants get reparations, too? There were ~4000 black slave owners owning more than 20,000 slaves. How does that figure into “Reparations”? Since the country’s founding 306,000 slaves were brought here, but since slavery ended more than 2,000,000 black Africans have come here by choice... another 1,000,000 Black Americans came here by choice and by way of the Caribbean. how does THAT figure into reparations?

Because of Larry elder it now seems to me that the only proper way to handle the inequities of the past is to make sure that our laws are just TODAY. That they’re applied equally to every citizen. To continue to provide access to opportunity WITHOUT favoring or handicapping ANY racial group. I think that’s the best we’ve got."

1.0,"A conversation about the optics of this,  I think is wrong. The Taliban maybe bad but there is nothing in this clip which is I haven't seen on or advocated on US TV.

2.0,"CENK! I admire you but the way you silenced Ana here was prettier horrendous. This was after all a section introduced and presented by her about the Taliban literally holding new media hostage in Afghanistan. You decided to steal the segment by turning it into an attack on your American media rivals. When Ana tried to respond to this you cut her off repeatedly and then said ""hold on"" which suggests you will allow her to respond at the end. But once you made your point you ended the section without allowing her any retort. 
The Taliban taking total control of the media is an important story but you dismissed it and silenced Ana voice by wagging your finger at her and then holding your hand up to silence her in a very dictatorial fashion. 
This came off terribly. I'm not saying this as some sort of fan of Ana, I actually think she too often doesn't do her due diligence before reporting on a story and it clearly shows but as a boss I would never raise my voice to literally drown out the voice of a female staff member while wagging my finger at her and then use the ""stop!"" hand gesture to silence them. You are meant to be a progressive.
I hope you read this as that was very dictatorial behaviour and is a nasty window into your workplace behaviour."

2.0,"This man is one of the reasons I respect people who serve our country with honor and respect. I’m not just talking about people who wear the uniforms either😒. Chief Acevedo made a good point where our problems lie. If you want things to change in your favor then you need to vote for it. Also, I know that this is old news but I really don’t understand why people always think violence is the answer. Look what this worldwide riot sparked from. Police brutality. I happen to respect the police department but when there is an officer who uses unnecessary force or worse goes against all protocol and what has been taught, then I lose that respect. Trump’s answer during this crazy situation was to “dominate”. I was disappointed not just because of how he spoke to the governors but also that he decided to use force as a first solution. should never be a first solution, no matter the circumstances. Here’s why. First depending on who you’re picking a fight with and how many, they might beat you senseless. Second all you are doing is making yourself look like the bad guy which is okay if you’re trying to conquer someplace but not such a good a idea to do with your own nation. Finally we have a thing called diplomacy. Ever heard it? Been around since the Roman Imperial Era? It doesn’t just apply with political agendas, if you know the country then it applies just as well to the public. Talking things out isn’t a guarantee, especially in the “free country”, but in emergency situations it’s a better first option than sending the National Guard. Violence is always met with more violence."

When Trump back these hate groups you protected him, a P.R. statement saying you refuse to support racism, then back Trump's hatemongering declarations the very next day. 

Who are you people to accept racism as a political platform? When David Duke supports Trump you did nothing, just give me my Tax Cuts and my Judges Mr. Trump.  

African Americans are being attacked on the streets by Americans for, cooking, sleeping, shopping by Trump Supporters you could care less. 

When Trump broke the law dealing with Russia you protected him again. 

  Meanwhile, the hate groups are getting stronger, Anti-Governments Groups increase, but you Republicans do nothing. 

I say this as an independent voter you have permitted Donald Trump to become an American Dictator to keep your power. 

He Attacked Black Lives Matter for his supremacist racist base, for a Photo Op. 
The Republicans did nothing, Terrorist attacked Michigan's Capital you did nothing to stop Trump. 
Trump told the Proud Boys, I'm with you 
The Republicans did nothing. 
The Capital Has Been Attacked and you have settled back and have allowed Donald Trump and his followers to commit treason.  

I say this to you honestly all of you are cowards to the Ameican People. It might not feel that way with the backing of Right-Wing Media, The Power and Money you have gained. 

We all saw it though, time after time watching you allowing Trump to do anything he wanted. 

A police officer has died and yes every one of you Republicans is to blame for his death, Fox News can't help you spin out of this. 

There is no honor, no integrity, or compassion within your party. 

Why do you ignore white supremacy and their organizations? 

Time won't heal this one, you have shown us who you are and we will never forget. 

Never Forget.

1.0,"Newsmax TV, the most war mongering propagandist news source available."
2.0,"I've been an American citizen for 26 years. During this time I've been following Russian and American news. I understand two perspectives. Americans aren't being told the truth neither about Russia nor China. In fact, with respect to both, Americans are constantly told lies, especially about China. When Trump was saying let's make friends with Russia, I began to think that Trump really wants to free America from the control of the Deep State because making any deals with Russia is what the Deep State doesn't want, be they Neocons or Democrats. Trump acted like Democrats were preventing him from making friends with or even talking to Putin or having a negotiation, meanwhile he imposed sanctions after sanctions against Russia. Then, at the end of Trump's term, he truly waged a massive anti-China information campaign, similar to the one Reagan waged against the USSR. What this tells me is that Trump wanted to fool everyone that he is a nice guy who wants to make friends with Russia and others. This tells me that he is still down with the people who are interested in regime changes in Russia and China and are not interested in negotiations, which means that Trump isn't any better than Bush, Obama, Clinton, etc. He almost fooled me. I thought that Trump was against the DS, but he was with the Neocons. If he wasn't with the Neocons, then he was surrounded by them, which means that he just couldn't really do anything from the get go and he wasn't in control of anything. They only allowed him to do certain things and said no to everything else. It is a 2-party 1-party system and the president is just a puppet, whether it is Trump, Biden, Obama, or Santa Claus."
0.0,First we must remove China Joe from office or we will be done with free America
2.0,I'd take Pompeo for President.

1.0,"Hillary Clinton to Trump: ""I cant wait to see you in prison.""  Trump Answers: "" I don't think they will allow you visitors."""
2.0,If Trump runs and wins in 2024 he needs to go scorched earth on every Dem and corrupt Rep in office.  We all understand you have limitations on your first term and that the second term is the time you get to pull all the punches.  Which is why the Dems were shitting their pants and which is why they used the Media to hide their illegal activities and corruption.

1.0,"This is how they remove people that MAY be conservative or republican from their jobs because let’s face it it’s the opinion of the leftists and dems that only trump supporters and republicans are against this vaccine which really isn’t true, people across the board are against the vaccine mandate not necessarily the vaccine. I’m a part time Uber and Lyft driver and today while working I met a woman who lost some of her sight and became partially paralyzed a couple days after taking the second dose of the vaccine and her doctor admitted it was almost certainly from the vaccine but these doctors aren’t reporting these cases so there really is legitimacy to peoples concerns about this vaccine and the government and businesses shouldn’t be putting mandates in place that essentially force people to get vaccinated or lose their jobs."

2.0,"Trickle-down ecomonic policy fails a shift in market (computer automation).
Automation dominates production and unstoppable.
Jobs are considered waste with automation, targets for removal.
Market doesn't create jobs like before, why taxes should be raised to pay for new jobs and infrustructure.
Trickle-down ignores that critical effect of computer automation, fuels inflation to give a boost to job loss from automation.
No compelling reason for citizens to pay for automation job-recovery with inflation when it's good times for market(automation).
Automation is good thing, saves time and gains more value than gold.

We allow politicians to invest in automation, they gain more despite job loss so it goes ignored.
Adding the 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution would fix it, end corruptton and trickle-down policy.
