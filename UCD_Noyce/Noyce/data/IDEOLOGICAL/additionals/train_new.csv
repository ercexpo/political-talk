2,"Thank you. So important to not let our like of other aspects of a person (policies, etc.) prevent us from holding them accountable to harms they’ve caused."
2,"Although I agree Gov. Cuomo's behavior seemed inappropriate at times & probably is best if he stepped down, don't think of the accounts I've heard that anything was criminal or against the law. Maybe he will find some other work as he seems like a very decent man. Hoping the new governor Kathy Hochul will do good for the great state of New York."
0,"They elected a man who said he grabbed them by the p***y….yeah, we have a long way to go."
2,I still say he made trump look bad during the first Covid and he's getting payback. I notice that women always believe women. I'm not convinced this time. I think she's (the one all over tv) is collecting a big paycheck. Just my humble opinion.
0,"Well said, the ""lack of transparency"", there is nothing worse than to be blindsided by a system that you trust. It should be a 2 way window with our government and it's; our officials, that we as citizens have elected to speak our voice, on our terms, our agreed terms as citizens. Thank you for your efforts, AOC all the way!"
0,Cuomo - give me a break - the line has moved! Only for you. We women have stood strong for so long along a line that you determined fit your needs. Your line is leading you out the door of the Governor’s mansion and office!!
2,We should also not elect abusers to become president
0,"Trump should have resigned also. Yet his supporters, wealthy white men could not let that happen. Side note, I am truly sorry for the abuse you are enduring from those around you. I bless the path you are on, and admire your perseverance in the face of assault. Be safe. Your life is too precious."
2,"Sometimes people don’t tell the truth, and that’s okay to admit as well. This abuser vs. abused binary is divisive and leaves 0 room for nuance. Sometimes trauma makes us believe something is happening that isn’t actually happening. That’s called psychic equivalence, and it’s a real thing, and it is not victim-blaming.
And no, that’s not the case all the time, but it does happen … a lot. We are entirely abandoning reality with these victim axioms as if there is no way on earth that there’s another side to things. THAT is just as well the first step toward totalitarianism
."
0,"I was so worried about how you would handle this. Need to clarify that you have no real responsibility to be vocal about business that’s not your own however as a political (really in career only…. And I mean that as a compliment) you have been and frequently do voice yourself opinions…. A lot, if not all, are not lunacy and I agree with. But as a fellow Democrat I worried you would stay silent, thank you for being unbiased by party. You are a shining example of how to be a public servant"
0,"And people wonder why victims don’t report right away. The response is so often that they are lying, don’t know how social interaction works, or were asking for the abuse. Can we stop allowing these powerful men to defend themselves on national television in this pathetic and manipulative way?"
2,"Biden said Cuomo did a hell of a job, except personally. There's the way Cuomo governed and another way he acted in a purely personal capacity that had nothing to do with being governor. And ""Our American Cousin"" was a hell of a play and a fine presentation by Ford's theater until John Wilkes Booth interrupted it halfway through. Patrons never even got their money back. And that's what's so sad, as Biden noted."
0,How about trump and Gaetz and Kavanaugh? Why are they not held accountable!?
1,We live in a hypocritical society where we rant against the police for treating certain POC as being guilty before facing justice of his or her peers in the court of law.. Are all not innocent until proven guilty in a court of law?
2,"Very well said. You are a true hero, not only to the district you represent, but also for all people that deserve better. We need more like you in our government. Get it, Queen."
0,"I agree fully, but why are only Democrats held accountable for their actions?"
0,Thank you. The sexual violence and abuse by powerful men can no longer be ignored.
0,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unrelated I know.
I’m from the UK and haven’t heard any official speak about what’s happening with Line 3.

A treaty is currently being broken, US law enforcement paid by the Canadian oil company for man power.

0,Well he is guilty like the former Orange Man female genitalia grabber. And all those who cover for them are abuser too.
0,"For every courageous women who refuse to be abused in silence there are multiples who still live in fear and suffering, they must feel safe to come forward, also there must be sever consequences for those who help the harasser cover up"
0,"I'm still waiting for the media and democrats to pressure Congressman Matt Gaetz to do the same and also legally force Trump's hand to submit his DNA in a possible rape case. Cuomo resigning is a win, and his replacement looks very promising comparably, but we need to pressure the other side of the aisle enough to get similar results."
0,"I love this. As a fellow Democrat I'm glad he resigned but am disappointed he seemed to feel no remorse, and took no blame. We have to be the party to take the higher ground, because we know they never will."
0,"I’m in awe of how AOC (or the person who runs her account) can articulate the modern complexities of civil rights. I do wish he was around to progress the Trump cases,I’m hoping it gets done with the same fortitude."
2,I don’t agree he should not have resigned. He was good for the state and got things done. This is the first time I have ever disagreed with AOC.
1,"Once again, the Democrats eat their young while Republicans revel in delight. I wonder how we'll all feel when a Republican wins the governorship and Trump gets a NY pardon."
2,Agreed. I was disappointed in his statement about the line being “redrawn”. It’s a face saving excuse and he needs to drop that and admit he knew he could flex his power over women because he’s been the governor. We need truth.
2,"Totalitarianism
doesn’t work without the introduction of delusional psychosis.
Also, narcissism."
0,"Thank you AOC, for helping blow the dust and cobwebs off institutions of power that have operated in the shadows for too long. Your courage is contagious and very much needed right now. ❤️"
0,"I agree with everything you said. But I am getting tired of the Dems always being the ones to stand up and take their own out for this type of BS behavior, while the GOP ignore it and let it continue and refuse to do the same with their own. We need to force them to do the same!"
2,We won’t forget how you forced Cuomo out with zero due process. Absolutely shameful. You will never hold higher office.
2,You need to recommrnd to your supporters what preferences to give for Mayor
0,AOC for president i love you Alexandria.

1,"Anybody else notice that Dems have been running America’s cities and inner cities for 3-4 generations and havent fixed them yet? As a matter of fact they continue to get worse…worse schools, more homelessness, more crime, etc. Yet Dems want you to believe they have more, new ideas that will fix the mess they created. So isn’t voting D like the definition of insanity?"

2,I remember last year how you helped Ed Markey get reelected to the Senate and saw you on TV with my Congressman Seth Moulton this morning.
0,i love AOC...perhaps the most anti-American congresswoman in the U.S. Bella Abzug would whip her butt for all the bad things she says about the nation. I hope she gives up riding in a car or flying in a jet between DC and NYC. She should walk her way into the Green New Feel! AOC for Prez. The end of the National Socialist Democratic Party along with her.

2,"If a doctor ""accidentally"" cut the wrong thing and a patient died they'd have their license tossed and lawyers on them faster than they could say ""my bad"""

2,How about some personal accountability for the people that are breaking the law and putting themselves into this
2,"Please don’t continue to support the very system your party now has ostensible power over. The drones, the detentions, the platitudes about common ground with those without human compassion or decency. You were one of the few who gave average people hope. Don’t be Fredo I beg of you. Don’t break our hearts."
2,"Pouring gas on a fire. Investigation barely even begun. You're part of the problem, you're helping grow a ""guilty until Proven Innocent"" society. Unless it meets your agenda of course.
Shame on you."
2,"I am angry and appalled at the recent events involving police and deaths of young black men. With that out of the way,I am the mother of a hard working, caring, good police officer who puts his life in danger on a very consistent basis. While those that do wrong should without a doubt be punished, let's not forget that there are more good cops than bad ones. Recruitment of police officers in this day and age is a challenge and it doesn't help that they are not paid enough for what they do either. Just remember to judge the individual for their actions and not every cop on the beat. I sincerely hope to see change to make everyone safer"
2,It’s a tragic incident for all parties involved.. so sad he had to resist and cause the escalation.
1,Way to incite violence Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A mistake that cost someone their life and was admitted to by the cop. End of story.
0,It is always right to criticize law enforcement in the United States. People think it's a crime -- especially after -- but it's a right.
0,"I heard a report today that none of the Brooklyn Center police force actually live in the community. If this is true, this is also a problem. A community's police department should reflect the community in which they protect and serve. This won't solve everything, but if the police are of the people of their community, they may have a different level of investment in its people. And more good police need to call out bad police."
2,"Question is , what are you politicians doing about it , or do you prefer to talk just enough to get re-elected? Do what they need you to do instead of saying it if you really want to make a difference! Once election season come around we the people Hear and watch nothing but promises and no action !"
1,"At the same time why not educate the ppl not to flee and obey the officers orders, in most cases at the max you would be arrested, warned or cited for wrong doing. But if you have a warrant ofcourse they arrest you. Obeying officers orders was one of things I was taught by my seniors when I arrived into US into 2006. Hope the young and vulnerable learn a lesson in addition to better training and rules for the officers to bring a positive change in the society. Bashing each other and politicizing the issue will only make mattes worse. Side note that kid at 20 should be in college not parenting a 2yr old boy, thats a broader problem this cntry has to address."
1,Just another reminder that it’s a dangerous profession being a criminal and resisting arrest. Let’s hold the criminals as accountable as we all want police to be.
1,"It was an unfortunate accident. At the end of the day the main lesson that should be learned from all of these unfortunate events is, ( stop resisting arrest). It will never end well. You fight the arrest in court, not on the street. Stop pointing the finger and take some personal accountability.
If you really want to lead Ms. Cortez, then this should be your message. I know you have good intentions, but you're going at this from the wrong direction."
2,"Your comments are not based on on emotion and presumption. The facts in this case do not support your assertions.This is very irresponsible behavior from a public figure and I would expect that people in positions of power and influence would feel the need to hold themselves to a higher standard. Great leaders seek the facts and stand up for what is right even when it is not popular. They bring people together, they don't divide and instigate."
2,His mistake costs him his life. Her mistake gets her early retirement with a pension and a chance to double dip with another police dept.
2,Or.. It was a criminal with a warrant resisting arrest who unfortunately was shot during a tragic
2,"The actual investigation has barely started. She admitted her mistake verbally on body cam. She resigned, she will be going to court. Ppl so negative b4 anything has even happened."
0,"The real way to end this type of crap is:
- Remove qualified immunity.
- Require ALL officers to carry $1M in malpractice insurance just like doctors and lawyers.
- Tie civil awards to the police retirement fund. Example: If there is a $3M award for misconduct $1M comes from the officer's insurance and the $2M comes from the retirement fund and NOT the tax payers.
- Create a national database of discredited officers (just like they do with lawyers and doctors) so if they apply for another law enforcement position their past WILL follow them."
2,How about people comply with the officers orders. Do not resist
0,"Excuse me for saying so, but it seems a bit odd that a woman who has been a police officer for 26yrs would 'mistakenly' draw her gun thinking it was her taser, if she doesn't know the difference between the two after 26yrs then she shouldn't be a cop at all and she sure as hell shouldn't be excused, or forgiven, for making such a stupid, not to mention fatal, rookie mistake..."
2,She should not be allowed to keep her pension!
0,how does a 25 year veteran not know the difference between a GUN and a Taser? O r better still how do they not know that the punishment for expired tags or misdemeanors is still NOT DEATH.
1,"...says the socialist who wants to increase state violence, authority, and spending."
2,Definitely a tragedy and avoidable. Maybe not run from the cops also. That might help
0,"The reason the cops pulled Daunte Wright over: He had an air freshener dangling from his mirror which was supposedly blocking his view.

I feel like that part of the story doesn’t get enough attention. Really makes you wonder if they were just looking for a reason to pull people over."
0,"Let’s not forget the mass proliferation of guns among USA citizens...so that police fear being killed with every racially profiled pull over. You can thank the misinterpretati

2,Time to end qualified immunity.
1,Tip of the day: Don’t fight with the police if you don’t want to get shot.
2,"When our grandchildrens grandchildren won't be able to pay back what we spent, it's too much. Especially when the entity responsible for ""fixing the problem"" is well known for its past great successes like the war on drugs, the war on terror, the war on poverty, etc."
2,Funny they never say it's too much when waging war.
2,Too much is when you decimate the American economy and send manufacturing jobs overseas only to create even worse pollution on the other side of the earth. Too much is when the government spends seniors SS money on programs to create more dependent voters. Too much is when govt overregulates businesses including child care facilities so much that they need a lawyer in house to navigate those laws/ regulations.
0,Bernie is not radical. He's just a honest to god democrat. The corporate lobbies just hate the truth. What made america great was a strong middle class not a handful of billionaires. Reasonable people need to vote. Not just the clowns.

They'll make you poor,

You're a failure if you can't make ends meet
on impossible wages at an impossible cost of living
with a worthless degree you will never pay off no matter how hard you work
while advertisers blare at you about your insufficiencies

while the news man tells you war is normal,
while Hollywood tells you the system is working perfectly,
while armed police guard grocery store dumpsters full of food from the hungry,
while executives go on five billion-dollar space rides for fun,
while you live surrounded by screens that tell you you are crazy
if you think any of this is not sane.

Take Oligarchizac™ for your depression,
take Plutocracipam™ for your anxiety,
just ninety bucks a pill.
Side effects may include compliance,
acquiescence, subservience, docility,
menticidal ideation,
a marked lack of interest in guillotines,
a dystopian society and a dying biosphere.

And the pundit says
""A new study by a Raytheon-funded
think tank says war is good for the environment,
but first here's a millionaire to explain the benefits of urinating on the homeless.""

And Hollywood says
""Here's a movie about well-dressed attractive people with nice houses
engaging in amusing antics you're too poor and stressed out to experience yourself.""

and fill the room with water
and then shame us for drowning
and then charge us for tiny gasps of air
from a hose that leads to an ecosystem
that they are destroying as quickly as they can.

And hey I've invented a new antidepressant anti-anxiety antipsychotic
that I'm getting to market as quickly as I can.
It's not a pill or a jab or an electrical shock treatment,
it's just a big wad of cash taken by force from thieving megacorporation

Side effects may include peace and relaxation,
an ability to buy food and think clearly,
a fondness for red flags,
and a hysterical corporate media.

And hey I think we just might make it,
past the veil of madness and cutthroat cruelty.

as yet untapped and as yet unrealized.

2,"To the greedy elites, any amount that doesn't generate them wealth or directly benefit them is too much"
2,"Bernie Sanders
Are you ready for a radical statement? I happen to think that Joe Manchin is right. Yeah, physical infrastructure is terribly important. But I happen to think that the needs of the human beings of our country — working families, the children, the elderly, the poor — are even more important, and we can and must do both.
Look, everybody in America — whether you're Republican, Democrat or independent — understands that, for the last many years, the very richest people in this country and the largest corporations have done phenomenally well, while the working class and the middle class of this country struggle, and we have got close to 600,000 people sleeping out on the streets.

Elderly people in America can't afford to put dentures into their mouth. They have no teeth in their mouth in some cases, can't afford hearing aids, can't afford eyeglasses. Working families cannot afford child care for their kids. Young people cannot afford to go to college.

And then on top of all of that, the scientific community is telling us that we're looking at a cataclysmic crisis in terms of climate. Oregon is burning. California is burning.

People are drowning in New York City. Detroit is flooding. Siberia has seen the largest fire on Earth. Drought is happening in places all over the world.

The United States must lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel. This is a crisis we are living in.

So, what polling tells us is that working families all over this country understand that NOW is the time for Congress to address the long neglected problems facing working families. Now is the time to have the wealthy and large corporations -- we've got billionaires in this country who don't pay a nickel in federal income tax.
So, I think we can do all of this. We can do the physical infrastructure.
We can do the reconciliation bill, create millions of good jobs, and finally tell the American people that we are going to stand up for working families — not just the rich and the powerful. Let's get it done.

Reminder: The actual cost of the Build Back Better Act is not $3.5 trillion, it's $0. The funding working families need is going to be paid for by taxing the wealthiest and corporations."

Time and time again, we've seen that the REAL America is far more conservative than the media would have us believe. McConnell and his party know they can stall until the midterms because they have more support than you. And you have to wonder how long it's going to take for progressives to accept that fact and learn to work with conservatives to get things done instead of always being adversarial and accomplishing almost nothing."

To consume a thing, is to extinguish a thing.

Democrats need to grow a back bone that parliamentarian
advise is just an advise on immigration so pass everything President Biden asked for and get something done in Washington and the American people will be empowered to vote for the Democrats again in 2022 and 2024.

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
2,"Bernie ur great, but u been saying the same stuff for years, & nothing been done.

So here's a NEW IDEA.
Can u & ur colleagues start referring to health insurance has a SOCIALIST CONCEPT, and belongs in a SOCIALIST MODEL.

Just saying it's a human right is fine, but that doesn't move the needle to much. U have to get ppl to see the logic, and change their minds. And u can do that better, by exposing the health insurance companies by doing the messaging this way.

How do health insurance companies make money?

They collect premiums r deny ppl coverage. THAT'S IT! And if u think about that, what is that, that's a SOCIALIST CONCEPT. If the CEO of XYZ insurance company is not happy making $5 million a year, they want to make 50 millon a year, what do they have to do, r the only thing they can do, is raise PREMIUMS r DENY ppl coverage. THAT'S IT. That's a socialist CONCEPT & belongs in a socialist MODEL. If u put a SOCIALIST concept into a CAPITALIST model, it will butt heads. It will not be as efficient r effective. And that's what we have now. And vice verse, u don't want a CAPITALIST concept in a SOCIALIST model. Otherwise, we'll all be waiting hours in line for stale bread. It's not like the CEO of walmart, if they want to make more money, they have to sell more, r be more efficient in their operations.Thus
, CAPITALIST CONCEPT, belongs in CAPITALIST MODEL. Same goes for health insurance companies. It's a SOCIALIST CONCEPT, & belongs in a SOCIALIST MODEL. Bcuz all they can do to make more money is raise premiums & deny ppl coverage. And that puts the squeeze on patients & doctors.

If u do the messaging this way, this will move the needle more to universal health insurance, bcuz ppl will see the truth & logic. Instead of just saying it's a human right, which it is, but to get more ppl to believe in universal health insurance, u need to do the messaging this way. A socialist CONCEPT belongs in a socialist MODEL. At minimum it should be non-profit.

I have some good ideas how to make to get this point across. And I'm sure, if u start this messaging, it will get done. Start beating the Republicans at their own game."

2,"Just more proof that 535 are on the payroll of big pharma. Passing laws and regulations in big pharma's favor. Then collecting their payments in one-way or another. That's how they get very wealthy ""working for the poor "". 😂😂"

1,Bernie You and your fellow Democrats in Congress have been the main part of the problem for 40 years. So please do not try to lie and say you actually want to do something about the very mess you have been a huge part in making all these years. That is the sad part is you have fooled people into actually believing your lies. Those people acting like fools have only made you richer and richer than the 1% that you pretend to be against. People who support Bernie and who support Democrats are only making the 1%ers richer and richer and causing a further gap in the income inequality.
1,"Bernie, did you ever suckle from the $$$ teet offered by a lobbyist? I don't expect an honest answer from you."

2,"I suspect that the ""lobbyists"" are really mobsters threatening members of Congress or getting the members of Congress ""indebted"" to the ""lobbyists"" by accepting bribes for votes.

Ivermectin is on the WHO list of essential medicines for human beings and was always an easy, inexpensive, and most important very effective treatment for Covid and which leads the patient to natural immunity.

At this point and with our knowledge, any doctor or hospital who does not prescribe Ivermectin for Covid is an egregious crimminal fraud and murderer.

2,It feels like we have lost. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. The vast majority of all US citizens that go into the field of medicine do it for the money and NOT to help people or better themselves. All patients are commodities to be exploited especially the dying - maximum profit!
2,Open the border for Canadians to come to the US ! Canada has over 70 % double vaccination rate ! What is the hold up ? I haven't seen my family in over 21 month & they live only one hour over the border. Why can people fly but not drive to the US.

0,"Yes, we need medical for all, apply 2% extra tax for medical below 65."
2,I agree this is a problem. But very few people use insulin in a vial these days. Let's talk about insulin pens and get up to speed. Or perhaps compare the average cost for 1 month's supply of insulin.
0,"Absolutely terrible the way we are charged for drugs. That should be number one for Congress, but hey, they don’t care about us and they have GREAT medical coverage. Maybe make them have what we do and have to actually pay for it and just maybe there will be a change. Seems like only Bernie is fighting for us. Keep it up Bernie maybe some day we will win."
2,"Paying $12 for life saving medicine should be something everyonr demands, regardless of party. It's ridiculous to let greedy pharmacy companies to have control over life saving meds or any meds for that matter. My wish is to see companies that exploited and caused the of people made to pay restitution. Hey,its better than tarred and feathered...whi
ch would include politicians who support greed companies."
2,"Absolutely. It’s K Street that’s responsible for this, and, of course, the politicians they bribe. We should make bribes to politicians illegal."
2,"And for those of us who choose healthy nutritional alternatives, such as juice that has kept my brain tumor from growing for 14 years that I have to pay $153 out of pocket instead of it's being paid for along with my vitamins and supplements which would be paid for in the Canadian system, and hopefully in Medicare for all. Please, please call Congress 202-224-3121 insist they bring medicare-for-al
l Bill to a vote now! With it covering Vision, Dental, mental health and long-term care"
2,hope it doesnt sound like gloating( im not) but vaccines are free in the uk ( as is all health care)... save the NHS...it wasnt given but hard fought for against the establishment of the time 1948...
2,"We’ve been hearing this problem for years…. No one cares. Congress has so many other things more important to do than these drugs prices… like fighting over masks, abortion rights, how to take back control of the Congress next year blah blah blah… that’s all they care … Forget it, we are on our own…"
2,Also insulin is usually free in Canada if you have supplemental insurance.
2,"That's the cost of pharmaceuticals
paying politicians. We are the ones paying for the corruption."
2,Our health care system is probably one of the best examples of how warped the definition of freedom is in the United States.
2,It is my understanding if implemented the proposed changes aimed at seniors won’t go into effect until 2028.
2,"Until our Congress and that includes every Democrat, Independent, and Republican, man and woman, STOPS taking bribes (monetary donations) from the Pharmaceutical companies in our USA, we will NEVER have the benefit of negotiating the lowest price! It is the same exact reason we will never have Universal Health Care (Medicare For All)! No other Country in our world has paid higher costs for medicine and health care, than the USA!"
2,Drug companies wouldn't have to charge it they didnt have to have stock piles of money for law suits in this country. Ever drug out there a lawyer trying to bv sue them over
2,"Buy a bus pass. Canadian taxes are extremely high, but they get a lot for their money unlike California."
2,As long as the uninsured aren't charged the maximum inflated amount to make up for lost profits.
2,We need to wake up to what's going on. We first need to vote and get out Country back before it's too late. There are way to many distractions. We are so close to becoming a dictatorship. Then we will not have to worry about any of this other stuff. We'll have nothing. We will be looking🙏 for a Country to take us in -as immigrants and see how kind that will be for us.
2,The engine that drives capitalism is competition. When there is a monopoly there is no competition. Russian and American oligarchs gave us rule by monopoly-ist.
2,We should also be talking about how to prevent type 2 diabetes with a proper human diet.
2,"Yup. Having grown up in both, I can say there are some notable and noticeable aberrations in the neighbouring pharmaceutical philosophies."
2,We are all sick of it but Congress is getting paid off too much by big Pharma so nothing will change. Greed needs to stop in Congress FIRST! Can you get that done???
0,"The laws of supply and demand are so easily manipulated to benefit the seller and satisfy the stock holder. ""Nothing personal, it's just business"" a quote from ""The Godfather"" is the mantra of the drug industry. Moral, ethical and fair trade practices are gone the way of the dinosaurs. It's the way of Trumpian economics. I'm left wondering if the corporations can be held culpable of involuntary malicious homicide. Given the drugs the deceased needed are less costly a few miles away in Canada...🤔😲😡😔"
2,So lotteries for people with the vaccine. Free testing free vaccines. Huh no free insulin?
0,I thought the solution was to cut the tax of the Novo Nordisk CEO? That’s what you were moaning about before…
2,"I'm Swedish, but if I had been American I would have fought hard for improving the health care system in the US, the richest country in the world. Sure, many people think of Sweden as a communist hellhole (we're not a communist country, we have a social democratic government, labour party), and we DO pay higher taxes compared to many other countries (but not a 60 % flat rate income tax, a lot of people are convinced we pay that). Anyway, the taxes are spent on health care among other things. Insulin is free, no cost for the patient at all.

Yes, I'm very aware you can't compare the US to Sweden. We're a small country with a different system. But if anyone is going to change the system, it's Bernie. He would be a kick-*ss president.

I'm an outsider looking in, and to me it seems like your system allows the greedy companies to be in control, to do as they please and charge people whatever they want."
2,"Yes, Bernie, who cannot agree? But the shareholders, Bernie, the shareholders! They vote too."
2,"I am sick and tired of hearing you and your ilk using this as a platform, but never actually doing anything about it at all."
2,"Sick of being suckered by the politicians who are paid by big Pharma to keep prices up , we are being scalped by the politicians who are supposed to be protecting us. Vote all the bums out until they stop screwing us."
2,"Yes - this is unacceptable. EVERYONE thinks it's unacceptable - everyone except certain greedy lawmakers. We need to replace representatives
who refuse to do the will of the people."
2,All republicans and three democrats voted against letting Medicare negotiate drug prices. What’s next?
2,"Cost in Australia if your 60 yrs old or older. Or make less than 39,000 . 5 dollars. For everyone else 12 dollars Australian ."
0,"Go Bernie! That is exactly on point! Keep on it and make it an issue in the upcoming elections. Accountability!
! Thanks for the continued effort."
1,"You know, might as well start a news show, the way you feed us information, but don't seem to be doing anything. If this is the way Democrats deal with being in power.... we got a tough fucking road ahead."
2,Anyone that's been in congress for decades and allowed this to legally happen should be in prison
2,"I bet that vile in Canada costs $100 but since the government pays a subsidy, the patients part is $12."
2,"Why can't Americans just buy the insulin from Canada? Let me guess, because the government says so."
2,"Cost of one vial in Puerto Rico, Lantus $485 dls, Insulin Lispro (humalog) 375 dls. 😢"
2,"Then do something. Talk, talk, talk. Can’t rally the troops Bernie?"
2,The solution to this might be to prevent diabetes in people in the first place
2,Who will subsidize the drug companies profits if we won’t.
0,"Well Bernie, seems like the republicans like for us to pay the higher prices n there is something that you n me can do!!! VOTE for Team Blue!!"
2,You are an angry old man who needs to retire. You bring nothing to our country or it’s people. Never have.
2,You also need to fix the patent system since Big Pharma routinely game that
2,If government got out of the way the price would naturally come down.
2,Bernie where you getting $100 insulin? My stuff is over $1500
2,"How about the covid test: ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Aug. 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for its BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Ag Card rapid test for detection of COVID-19 infection.

2,Every time I read Bernie's posts I read it in his voice...
1,"Please help us,please Congress do something for the American people,Democrat

1,M4A would solve this problem. Maybe stop posting and tweeting to the people that already agree with you and start fighting Biden and the Dems that won't help us.
2,"A retired nurse of 36 years, makes me sick the greed!"

2,Lobbying needs to be outlawed and term limits need to be introduced. Maybe then we'll have Politicians vote in favor of laws that help us..
0,we are fighting for our democracy the Republicans are trying to take it away. The Republicans don't believe in democracy. We can't have Republicans rule any branch of government. We are fighting for democracy or we will get a dictatorship look at Florida Georgia and Texas. Other states are trying to pass voter suppression bills. We need a democracy or our constitution doesn't mean anything.
2,I don't see this ever changing. Big Pharma gives big bucks to politicians campaigns. this will go on forever. BP owns too many elected congressional figures. so sad.
2,"America values greed over the lives of people, when the dollar is the only thing you optimise to…"

0,Bernie you’re the only politician I have ever supported. I hope you can get the current party to abolish the filibuster and tax the wealthy their share. Thank you!
1,That level of greed should be considered unlawful but Capitalism is more important than working Americans somehow.
2,"Yes it’s come a long way from my Public Health Nursing day of like all about our Government (Republican now) and the allowance of pharmaceutical companies to be greedy legally and get away with it.
No party has helped it get better and these posts don’t & won’t make a difference.
There needs to be a elite that financially can take the Pharmaceutical Companies on.
Otherwise, we all know it will not happen. The government won’t and us, common people can’t afford the battle to bring our drugs down in cost.
They are outrageous compared to even Mexico costs for Rx drugs."
2,"In the UK, a vial of insulin averages the equivalent of $7.20"
2,We do not want this spending! We are the working class we work not to pay our wages to people who do not. You give up your million dollar homes first! You are a huge hypocrite!
2,America won’t learn. One half has been convinced anything to their benefit is a conspiracy.

Oooooo it is taxpayer money not bernies"
1,democrats so misinformed
2,"What I don't get is how the corporation gets sole ownership of the patent if the American citizens are paying for the research and development of many of these drugs.

First, that sounds 100% like an administrative failure. Drug companies don't just get this research funding out of thin air. They negotiate with the government for them. Exactly like with the Covid vaccines. That deal has been outstanding for the American people. Could you imagine if everyone had to buy our vaccines out of pocket or through insurance? We probably wouldn't have 25% of Americans vaccinated, and they'd be coming from Europe.

I would laugh in the face of a drug co CEO if he came to me with a bullshit deal like what we have been getting. I would feel like he was spitting in my face. I would kick them out of the White House and call his biggest competitor asking if they would like to be the first drug company to release xyz drug? Yeah? Great, but if Americans are paying for the research we get royalties on sales which will go to help fund future medical research, and there will be cap limits on American patients, with lower caps for the elderly and veterans. We would get that drug developed and CEOs would seriously think twice about going to the White House thinking that they are going to scam the American people."

Education is a good investment from an individual, family, community or national perspective and tuition free education will reduce the burden from the root on our medical expenses too for example.

Healthcare for all is actually CHEAPER with the insurance industry off of the table along with most of the time lost due to billing among many other reasons.

A universal basic income (UBI) is CHEAPER than all of the thousands of individual federal, state and local social safety net programs including things like Social Security and unemployment insurance, etc with all of their budgets, overhead expenses and inefficiencies eliminating the humiliating need for people to lose time to prove their poverty to qualify for aid.

Internet for all is a great and necessary investment to give everyone the opportunity to study, search for work, work remotely, etc online.

Solar power is CHEAPER and electric vehicles are soon to be CHEAPER to make and already are considerably CHEAPER to maintain and operate, especially if charged from your own solar power.

What do you think will happen to crime rates, peace and equality in general after we launch universal healthcare, a universal basic income, universal education and internet for all, raising the starting point of capitalism from zero, we’ll let you die with no money, to a level of life with dignity, reducing societal daily fears on a massive scale and freeing us to welcome the automation revolution with open arms rather than with fear and great harm? 😃 EqualityMovemen

2,It's hard to tell if you are one of the good guys. Most of what you say seems to divide and I can't help but wonder if that is by design.

1,"Well Bernie, manufacturers get threatened by socialized medicine countries that if they don’t sell at whatever cost those countries want to pay, that they’ll steal the formulations and have China make them for nothing. Depriving the manufacturers of their intellectual property, investment return, worthwhile risk, and return on costly research. Often times forcing those companies to sell drugs below cost rather than being put out of business. The US couldn’t care less about protecting innovations and intellectual property abroad so those companies have to make a profit somewhere. That all being said, you are highly full of 💩 as usual not sharing free and substantially lower prices that your followers could receive (yes, WITHOUT insurance). I wonder how much innovation in medicine we’d have if we didn’t have incentives for companies to make new medical progress. I sure bet a socially managed drug world would stifle the advancement that these companies do and create. Focus on stopping your comrades in other countries and the white house from stealing from innovators and make them all pay their fair share. Why is there never any substance, background or solutions that exist that you can share? Greed my ass. Explain the dynamics and why what happens does. Hint: drug companies need to turn a profit and take on tremendous amounts of risk, failure, and loss. Protect American companies from getting robbed by socialist country extortion artists, defend intellectual property, and the prices will come down. You have such a presence and platform that could be used for good. All you do is fear monger instead of providing existing solutions and support for innovation. Socialist America is its own worst enemy. I wonder how many people you kill each year by convincing them it’s hopeless when there are options for them to get their medications for next to nothing or free."

How far should rules go? Desert Sun Gannett Article
--- --- ---
I commend the Palm Springs City Council for going further than almost every other city, even the most progressive, in enacting both a vaccine and a mask mandate. Even San Francisco and New York have only mandated one or the other.

The city should now mandate medical grade masks, since cloth masks are virtually useless. In fact, they should unilaterally re-enact Newsom’s old color coded system, and require strict capacity limitations and masking outdoors. We need at least a 50% capacity restriction, plus a mask mandate, plus a vaccine mandate to control the virus now. And leave more restrictions options on the table if people just won’t behave.

‘Reasonable people can disagree about when a zygote becomes a ""human life"" - that's a philosophical question. However, regardless of whether or not one believes a fetus is ethically equivalent to an adult, it doesn't obligate a mother to sacrifice her body autonomy for another, innocent or not.

Body autonomy is a critical component of the right to privacy protected by the Constitution, as decided in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), McFall v. Shimp (1978), and of course Roe v. Wade (1973). Consider a scenario where you are a perfect bone marrow match for a child with severe aplastic anemia; no other person on earth is a close enough match to save the child's life, and the child will certainly die without a bone marrow transplant from you. If you decided that you did not want to donate your marrow to save the child, for whatever reason, the state cannot demand the use of any part of your body for something to which you do not consent. It doesn't matter if the procedure required to complete the donation is trivial, or if the rationale for refusing is flimsy and arbitrary, or if the procedure is the only hope the child has to survive, or if the child is a genius or a saint or anything else - the decision to donate must be voluntary to be constitutional.
This right is even extended to a person's body after they die; if they did not voluntarily commit to donate their organs while alive, their organs cannot be harvested after death, regardless of how useless those organs are to the deceased or many lives they would save. That's the law.

Use of a woman's uterus to save a life is no different from use of her bone marrow to save a life - it must be offered voluntarily. By all means, profess your belief that providing one's uterus to save the child is morally just, and refusing is morally wrong. That is a defensible philosophical position, regardless of who agrees and who disagrees. But legally, it must be the woman's choice to carry out the pregnancy. She may choose to carry the baby to term. She may choose not to. Either decision could be made for all the right reasons, all the wrong reasons, or anything in between. But it must be her choice, and protecting the right of body autonomy means the law is on her side. Supporting that precedent is what being pro-choice means.’” ~ from a friend"

She may only get a second term as an AZ Senator if she switches and becomes a republican. Dems in AZ are feed up with her votes and her VERY childish drama."

But we only have 25 people in hospital and 5 in ICU & no deaths at all this year - that is state wide total - not per day. But the entire state of over 5 million is in lockdown, curfew 9pm-5am, can only travel 5km from home, allowed outside for only 1 hour per day to excercise, all businesses except for essential services are closed-most are now backrupt, schools are still closed. This is our 6th lockdown - we have had more than 200 days in lockdown and no school attendance for 200 days. The mental health in the school aged children is our new pandemic but Victorian government will not address it - or even discuss it at their daily press conference. Violent protests are not the answer - but we are not surprised that it is sadly coming to this.😢"

2,I believe a good reason the lockdowns have not been as bad in the US is because the average american owns guns.

1,Radical left will try to get every one of our rights eliminated.
1,"After so long of being told to stay home, don’t talk or interact with anyone and mandatory lockdowns the people will get tired of it! The people will raise up against their “leaders” and we will see countries succumb to revolutions much like the French Revolution! The people will get tired of being controlled, lied to and fed lines that the governing bodies knows what’s best for you while they’re actively breaking their own mandates and requirements to semi participate in society."

It is 1960""s Russia here."

2,"I live in Melbourne, Australia Tucker, I'm in my 50s now & am so disturbed about what is happening here 😳 Thank you for reporting the truth & sharing the plight of my country 🙏 I'm scared to leave my home here & barely go out, this is not the country I grew up in & loved, this is hell on earth 😢"
1,Highest hypocrisy from dems. A little bit of science and anyone can get that mask doesn’t protect but destroys your lungs and immune system.
2,Complete control of we the people using scare tactics until we expose them for what they really are. Domestic Terrorist groups and this Tyranny group are all about totally controlling we the people and destroying our Great Society any way they can so they can stay in power
2,"Here in Washington state the governor's mandate on the vaccine, excludes himself, all cabinet members, all state commissioners, and all state board members, but their employees MUST get the vaccine. Makes you go hmmm."
2,"Worst thing about it: I saw footage of protest here on facebook from some Australian outlet. And 99% of comments was: ""so many stupid and selfish people, they deserve what they got, they treated them too lightly.""
I found only 3 comments supporting the protesters.
I must say I was shocked especially by how many people used the term ""selfish"" parroting the mass media. Brainwashed."
2,"Disgusting. How can anyone continue to elect such garbage? Off topic, and this isn't a left or right thing, because there are plenty on the right too, but holding a government position for this long, gaining the wealth and power she has from it, shouldn't be allowed. For Pete's sake... 😡"

2,It’s absolute frightening lunacy! Thank you for showing this. We as Americans need to see where this is heading.
1,"When is Pelosi being impeached? Oh that's right, she's a Democrat. They are protected by hypocrisy."
2,I was just talking about this. I don't watch Fox News anymore but this is exactly what I have been trying to say. Look at the tyrannical policies being enforced. It's coming to the US if people don't wake up. Read the studies and look at the science. Don't just take the word of mainstream media. They are trying to push a narrative that is absolutely not supported by the science. This is absolutely sickening.
1,"Yes it is every bit as bad in Melbourne Australia as it appears!
200 plus days of hard lockdown plus a similar amount under heavy restrictions such as not being allowed to have any visitors, work, travel more than 5kms,( 3 miles), and curfew from 9pm to 5am.
We are under the control of an insane dictator obsessed with eradication of the virus while nuking everything!
Kids and people are topping themselves or attempting to, and going around the bend.
Fine for going to the protest or disobeying rules is $5000 dollars!!
The mainstream media are pushing the same propaganda as the Andrews government has inflicted on us.
Lockdowns mightn't even end after we hit 80% vaccinated, now they're pushing for kids to be included!
I Weep for my children's future, democracy Worldwide has never been more in peril! 😕"
1,"Australia is a perfect example of why Americans should be so grateful of the 2nd amendment and do everything you can to protect it!
I don’t believe Australia’s government would be doing what they’re doing if they had a nation full of arm citizens."
2,"Let's not forget that the government has confiscated all the civilian guns as well. Oh that's right, they were forcefully surrendered."
1,"I am from a Suburb in Sydney, NSW. Every morning at 11am all the MSM televise our Premier, Gladys Berajiglian ranting and raving about this Delta virus and the dangers of it. We went into lockdown on 26 June 2021 and as of Monday 23rd August, she placed a curfew, no one allowed out of their home between 9pm -5am. when this Delta outbreak began, she said 1,000sands are going to get the virus and 1,000sands are going to die. So far 130 have passed away, and I would be confident to say 100 died of old age and the rest died of other illnesses other than Delta. They even listed a 15yr old boy as a Covid death who was in Hospital for menningacoccal.
It is absolute Tyranny in the state of NSW. We are not even allowed to protest, the Government has given the Police force all powers to make sure of that.

They have scared the population so much that 6,000,000 have had at least 1 dose of the vaccine.

We are living in a nightmare in ""The Lucky Country."

We are under a curfew 9pm to 5am,and we need permits to work, and that's if your an essential worker, our lockdown rules are pretty harsh, I can't visit my daughters, can only travel over 5kms for work, not pleasure. No standard retail is open, only essential shopping centres, and Saturdays protest came out of pure frustration, people are tired of being locked away, it's a shame it came to that, but people are on edge. If we do get to 80% vaccination, Queensland and Western Australia have said they may not open their boarders to other states ,because they won't 0 covid, so yep we're doing it hard down under. 🇦🇺🇦🇺"
1,Australia is a perfect example of what happens to an UNARMED population....
2,All Americans should of made a stand to stop the control long before the Afghanistan mess.
1,No one can trust their government and do not give up Any constitutional rights or rights to protect yourself
2,Coming to America soon if men and women don’t realize today that this country’s freedoms we still have is worth fighting for.
1,When komunist and fascism gets together everyone will be afraid of flu 😢. Sad to let the history repeat more worst
1,Thanks Tucker Carlson Tonight It's true here in Melbourne. Lockup 6.0 Only allowed out for 5 reasons. Get caught too far from home they fine ya. Curfew. 5km limit. Permits for everything. Kids still learning online. Mental health issues growing. Vacant shops growing. Yet people keep voting the socialists back in.

2,"No. My body, my choice. They do not have the right or power to control medical decisions on anyone else's behalf. Mask mandates are illegal. Vaccine mandates are illegal. Any mandate made by the branch is illegal. Only the legislature can write laws, and still are limited by the United States constitution as well as each individual state's constitutions. That is it's purpose...to limit their control. We the people are the boss, not our representatives
. They were elected to represent us, not rule us."

0,"Question...is it the owner that is requiring the employees wear a mask or is it Pelosi? I dont think it's Pelosi. I think it's the caterer and the employees may be going in and out of a building.

We don't have all the facts.

Plus they are outside...masks
are not required outside."
1,"I live in Melbourne, Australia 🇦🇺 and I can tell you this stuff is happening. It's scary now the government wants kids five years old and up to wear a mask"
2,This is where police have to draw the line and refuse to do the bidding of the government. To participate is reprehensible.
2,"Love your stuff, Tucker. One thing, the Aussie they are hunting was COVID positive and avoiding isolation (currently 14 days of quarantine). He wasn't just avoiding the lockdown, he was knowingly infecting those around him."
0,You skipped the part where Matt Lawson was shot with rubber bullets! The man being dragged into the blockade was shot i think 8 times on his body while 2 other coppers sprayed him with pepper spray. Gutless wonders is what it's called here!
1,"Tucker….you need to be an investigative reporter that you are and solidify who is actually running this country and trying to change it forever….you have hinted to it in the past, but we the people want to know who the hell it is. Thank you for what you do everyday"
2,How are Australians not attempting to overthrow their government right now.
2,"Say this out loud and let it sink in...""ELECTIONS
HAVE CONSEQUENCES"". The people that are being elected at every level of government from your local school board to the President don't have your best interests in mind. They run for positions for power and to execute their will not your will or the will of the majority. Take every election as a serious measure to ensure you only your well being but maintain your freedom. Or else this will become Australia..."
1,This was seriously a scary segment. The hypocrisy from Nancy Pelosi is nothing new. She’s a disgrace. But the drama going on in Australia is unbelievable. I’m sure none of them are reporting any deaths from cancer or the flu or heart attacks. Over a year later…. And the WORLD still has zero clue.
2,We need to take back our government they are doing nothing for us.
0,"Martial law is coming to us soon, just watch! Our administration wants 2 classes of people, the very rich and the very poor who work to support the rich. Does this sound familiar? We’ve seen it before, just not here…yet."
1,"Our KY state Governor has done same , caught in photos without mask in public events, after mandating masks.😡"
1,"Why don't you wear a mask Pelosi and I'll do want I want, FREEDOM!"
2,This absolutely terrifying to me. Americans better wake the hell up & start fighting back!
1,Australia gave in when they gave up their guns they gave up their second amendment and they gave up everything that it took for their first amendment their third and everyone else after that Australia caved and they allowed it to happen plain and simple
1,"And they are coming to New Jersey too because our governor is a feckless progressive who has no respect for his constituents.
He prefers criminals illegals and people who like to give away taxpayers money like water."
1,"This is the end result of gun confiscation, what was shown going on in Australia is what happens to a docile unarmed populace. The only reason the powers that be here in the US cannot do what the Aussie's are doing is because of our 2nd Amendment and 500+ million weapons in civilian hands. Once push came to shove as seen with the authoritarianis
m in Australia, American's would fight back but we would not comply with this kind of brutality on our streets from the government. Of course this is just my opinion on what i just saw."
1,Wow! Mr Carlson it must be really frustrating and devastating for you to to provide these news to us. May the Angels of God be with you and your family. God bless you for your heroic love. A God help us deal with tge New world we are facing.
1,I bet they wish they wouldn't have gave up their firearms now. America would be just like this if we didn't have a 2nd Amendment
1,There is evidence that it also spreads via shedding or fecal matter… so when they finally accept that bit of scientific data maybe they will realize that all the lockdowns and isolating people in groups trapped in their own domiciles was not the smartest idea. The people in charge are going about this all wrong.
2,"Stop calling our elected representatives
leaders!! They work for us and should be representing us… not leading anything.. rather serving!!"
2,Apparently ppl back then had more integrity than ppl today!
0,I would suggest that Tucker Carlson and others concentrate on fixing what's wrong it their own back yard before they start knocking other places. As usual the story is dramatised out of proportion.
2,Actions always speak louder than words! She is as fake as they come!!
1,Intolerable laws sparked the 1775 revolutionary war of independence against the British Crown. Here we go again waiting for another war of independence against the Democrstic wealthy elite.
0,It will be alot of blood in the streets if that happens in this country to many people with guns and military training the don't agree with this behavior from the government. Just my opinion
2,"Tucker Carlson how dare you call the New Zealand President ""The lady with the teeth who is very popular""
Tucker Carlson, how dare you imply the Govenor of the State of Victoria is a lunatic for saying ""We are breaking the rules if we watch the sunset"" !
PS. I agree with you."
2,Unfortunately there are a number of people who can have all the evidence continually shoved in their faces and it will not make a bit of difference.
2,The hypocrisy within our government is beyond redemption. These oligarchs need to be removed before Americans will ever trust the government again. Does anyone know what the % is on Americans who don't trust the government is? It has to be higher than ever.
1,"It's so very sad for the real people of the United States of America, to have to continue to put up with the Biden administration what a load of rubbish the Biden administration has TURNED out to be. There's no way the real people of the United States of America are being held accountable for the Biden administration.
God bless you all."
1,"Australia is a perfect example when the people become complacent and allow their government to disarm them and rule over them.

Quite frankly I thought Australians were smarter than this. I can see Brits allowing it but I never thought the Aussies would."
2,They are “sophisticated people” like the ones at Obama’s b-day party. No masks needed.
1,"Fact of the matter....peopl
e don't wear masks when they eat. Having this type of event in NAP with a high rate of COVID is typically Democratic poor optics and she doesn't care. She is the most powerful person in DC...more powerful than the President, and is in Napa to raise money for the Dems and preserve that woeful Gavin Newsome's governorship. Politics, power, and money are far more important to her...witness what she has or has not done for the people of CA in her time in Congress....and
the Dems continue to elect her......pitifu
l.....I left CA in 2013 for TN and while I love the state and all it offers, the politics, economics, social justice, and environmentalis
ts have ridden the Dem and state train into the ground...."
2,"Facebook keeps removing my ""Like"" and ""Angry"" status on this post. I wonder why? Is it going against their community standards?"
0,"Some of your facts are wrong, example only half of Australia is in Lockdown . Sydney NSW , and Melbourne VIC , the rest of the states ( 4 ) are open fully with no restrictions. The other facts are correct, but not explained fully. The man who sneezed in the lift has covid but will not isolate , he wasnts to spread covid to others that's why the Police are looking for him.
Religious services are banned because of lockdown rules , you can only zoom your services. This minister broke the rules knowingly and got caught. Yes the lockdown is over the top , only because of the low vaccine rate in the beginning, now the rates have increased dramatically . Enjoy your show from down under , Sydney, Australia .👍"
1,"That’s the state of Victoria which is run by a communist, Daniel Andrews. The protesters should rally around recalling Andrews and running for political office to change these communist rules he’s put in place."
1,Her little drama queen aoc needs to be the first to wear a mask as well as Schumer and herself
2,Tucker Carlson Tonight I am Australian and the horse lady made me laugh for a bit then you got to the very real segments about Australia and I cried at how accurately wrong we are being treated it’s an absolute disgrace and so disheartening. Many here are just getting on with their lives whilst our fellow Australians just across the Queensland border into New South Wales are being treated like leapers. I am afraid for our children’s futures 😢
2,Don’t worry about the police beating you with batons... they just want you to stay healthy. 🙄
2,I'm surprised you did not mention the forced v🪓ination of children. They physically ripped children from their parents' arms and v🪓inated them.
2,"If you haven’t watch the movie “The Hunger Games”, go ahead and watch all! If you ever notice movies are years in advanced of what could and might happen to our world/ country! The thing is no one wants to believe it! Quit giving up your control! Vote these people out b4 it’s to late!"
2,How many times did she say young people in less than a minute. The young people are the vulnerable. Raise your kids right.
2,Oh god. This is too sad. As a New Zealander with friends and family in Australia hearing what a compliant community we are makes me realize just how we would have behaved in Nazi Germany.
2,We should have done this last summer when all the rioting and looting was going on. Our us police in every state should have been allowed to use the same kind of force.
2,It's coming to all nations. This is leading to the return of Jesus for the Church. The anti christ will be revealed. Ppl have seen nothing yet.
2,We are with you Australia stand up and fight for your right.
1,"Im an Aussie living in South Australia, we haven't had a new case of C19 for weeks and have had 4 deaths since the start of the plague, but we are still forced to wear face diapers in public."
2,"Anyone who thinks and feels your beneath them is worst than racism, especially when it's coming from your own goverment"
2,"Believe me, I can’t stand Pelosi, but in fairness this was outdoors, and I am way against giving the maskholes any more ammo."
1,They need to come after Nancy and Obama..... They just held Super spreader events.... LOL.
1,"The thugs in police uniforms started the violence, and sharpshooters wielding military spec automatic rifles were shooting pepper bombs at people, one hitting a 10 year old boy. Others shot rubber bullets, and at least 2 mounted among them ran their terrified horses directly at the people.

No Tucker, this is NOT the Australia you know, and whose Army Engineers’ uniform I once wore with pride.

It’s now home to the socialist thugs running roughshod over the people. You’re right about one thing; Victorian, Queensland and Western Australian voters have recently voted them back in.

It’s unbelievable and, IF I could afford it, and IF I could leave (yes, locked in, locked up and locked down), I’d emigrate."
2,This kind of crap has been out there since the beginning the problem is people will not listen people will not take charge of thier own choices own life
1,"Maria Papademetri
You must listen to this. They shot dogs in Australia so people wouldn’t leave their homes to adopt. Much of what he is saying also took place when Stalin was in power. My mother told me of not being allowed to talk to anyone as they’re being told in Australia now."
1,"What about the next mandate? Do you really believe, after seeing this and Obamas birthday party, that these people are getting the vaccine? Or is it all for show so the masses are mandated? Vaccine is not mandated for the White House or Phizer employees."
2,"Power mad it’s dangerous, no caring or compassion for anyone . Very sick leaders"
2,"To be fair, it's NOT the federal government of Australia implementing these draconian lockdowns, it's the individual state leaders, over the last 19 months it's shown the the feds only collect taxes and defend the shores"
2,Democrats can do anything they Want to. It's EVERYONE else thay can't. Just remember if you're getting aeay with something there's always someone else going to get you!
1,People are ignoring reports like this and letting their fellow citizens be targeted and made to be criminals. Covid mandates and lockdowns are creating a reward system. Comply and we give you back your freedoms. Till they stop doing that too.
1,"Im in Queensland, Australia.
Certain States have different rules, Victoria is the most totalitarian, New south wales is a bit better, but stil mandating masks and forced vaccinations, but the other 4 states and 2 territories aren't in lock down.
There may be a 3 day lock down here and there if there are 30 ish cases, but it depends on how much of a Dictator the state health officer is"
2,Well we must love hypocrisy today. Because a lot of it is taking place right now and it seems like no one cares
2,The media here plays scenes of people at these rallies calling them selfish with the evil foreboding music in the background and then switch to hopeful uplifting music when showing people in line to get vaccinated calling them heroes.
2,"More Mandates are coming. If they can legally fire someone for not wanting to take the vaccine. Once they declare Global warming a crisis. Your travel will be greatly restricted.
Anyone in politics... regardless the political party they belong too. Should immediately be voted out of office. Sad to say... but for the most part. All of us on here are a systemic part of the problem. We get riled up but quickly calm down. Myself included."
2,We need to stand together & stand up for our rights!!
1,Who’s going to print the T-shirt’s “I’m a dangerous slacker cause a won’t wear a mask so shoot me” cause I will wear one. Totally not tasteful but the whole thing is beyond absurd and most Americans are beyond fed up and that also speaking up in defense also of this heinous crime too. The world has gone insane and it’s time to stand up!
1,"The only reason why I wear a mask, is because I can't afford the $200 ticket the police will give me here in Israel. It's horrible."
1,Shocking but so happy Tucker is speaking out!!! I hope ALL Americans watch this!!!
1,"I have great respect Tucker, and by no means agree with mask mandate. But they are at a table, outside, fixing to eat. Now how do you eat a 30k meal with a mask on. Even Republicans take them off to eat.
This is getting attention for silly reasons."
1,I can’t with all this. We are going to start killing dogs now because of covid. Society is sick.
1,It's time we stand strong against this bs! They cannot jail all of us o r get money from the poor? They cannot keep up with rules? Rules are made to be bent and laws are made to be broken as far as this ridiculous mandate goes
1,This is not some communist country -- this is AUSTRALIA! We canNOT let this happen here!
1,Who is giving these leaders these rules. They are obviously getting there rules from some higher authority and it definitely not the WHO it’s something else. This is a takeover of the world and people need to put politics aside and stand up against this tyranny!!!!
2,"""....the people making and enforcing the rules had no intention of following the rules"".........
YEP, that about sums it up right there"
1,Just like Obama's party they all know this is nonsense. They aren't saying so but they're demonstrating it very clearly all of them. They only put on masks for the TV camera.
2,Our mask mandates go into effect Thursday. Mask exceptions on the list: courts in session and meetings or sessions of the Nebraska Legislature 👀
2,"Not all Aussies are taking this lying down. Hence why there were thousands in Melbourne, lots in Queensland (who the police could only standby and watch because they were not in lockdown), and in Sydney. You’re affiliate in Australia (Skynews) is all over it and has a growing following. As you said, people will tolerate a little inconvenience but not hypocrisy."
1,"I can’t believe what I’m looking at. How can people accept being treated like prisoners being herded by thugs in uniform……… all because of a bloody mask.
It is really sinister watching this. And listening to that New Zealand nut warning people not to talk to their neighbors. This has to stop while we can still stop it."
1,"Tucker Carlson Tonight, you’re not completely correct in your Australian report. Not all of Australia is under Marshall law, just New South Wales and I think Victoria. Queensland is at this point still reasonably free, but it won’t take much for us to go under either. Interstate travel is near impossible though."
1,The Delta variant is completely undetectable. There is no PCR test or rapid test that can pick up on the Delta variant. The only thing they can believe is that fear is going to drive people to believe that this is a powerful virus. The Delta variant is a weak mutation
2,"What doesn’t amaze me is that you have a very big crowd that can easily overpower the officers arresting just one individual, but instead of helping they would rather record and just feel like they are doing something “important”. That… is selfish and ignorant… no, sorry, that’s selfish and stupid. My opinion of course."
0,"tucker - you stated tonight that gov. abbott refused to,send national guard t the border - not true. they are there now assisting border patrol in arrests. there have been other guard there as well from other states."
2,"Yikes, they had crazy Karen's back in those times too, but with loaded guns 😳😬🤦‍♀️....well this type of same hyprocrisy of rules for thee, but not for we happened at the G7 too, and there were videos of it documented so why are we all wearing masks again? 🙄"
2,The world has gone mad!!!! So many people just don't see it. Governments certainly have hidden agendas!
2,"As much as I appreciate the service that our law enforcement provides to our communities, I also know that at any given moment they can turn their backs on me. Not only did we see this happening in several blue states, but now we are seeing it in Canada, New Zealand and now in Australia. If people continue giving these authoritarian politicians more power, and later realized their mistake, by then it will be too late."
2,Wow what BS from Australia. They do not want people talking to each other to expose the lies that are being perpetrated on people.
2,"We've seen what the ""elite""/
will be-- doing!! I pray it shakes us to the core and simply refuse to do ANY unconstitutional act. Those who blame our ""protectors"" that are daily putting their lives on the line for you, shame on you!! Who are answering YOUR calls for help?? The tooth fairy??"
2,"It's coming people, happening in Australia. When is enough is enough. It's time ""WE THE PEOPLE"" take our country back."
1,We would turn Afghanistan in to the greatest country on earth if they sent all the Maga wearing non vaccinated there.
2,She was caught at hair salon ask about it and said some excuse and that she would not talk about it Any further no one pressured her let it go thus will also go away - it’s their way but they tell u what to do but do as they please and we wonder why the country is divided.
2,"Gr8. Fearless Pelosi can saddle up wth Biden, Harris & the squad & go rescue people out of Afghanistan."
1,"That's what happens when Citizens give up their arms, they become subjects and serfs."
2,"I have a theory that those people freak out so much about that crap because they've lived such shityy lives like stealing from their constituents, their nations and all around being degenerates that they are almost certain they are going to hell so they are doing literally anything to stay alive. Also take notice that their police and I'm sure ours in America will have absolutely zero issue with just following their orders."
2,It's so sad to see that Australians are now facing pure totalitarian fascism! I lived in Australia - Adelaide - in 2000-2001 and I enjoyed the relaxed freedom of Australians then. This is politics turned amok!
0,Tucker Carlson will you be leaving Fox now that they are requiring vaccines for all staff? It seems the hypocrisy is t just in Washington if you stay.
2,"Feudalism is the society they want to bring back.
""he dominant social system in medieval Europe, in which the nobility held lands from the Crown in exchange for military service, and vassals were in turn tenants of the nobles, while the peasants (villeins or serfs) were obliged to live on their lord's land and give him homage, labor, and a share of the produce, notionally in exchange for military protection."""
0,Friggin hypocrites. This is unacceptable. Why isn't something being done about it. Gutless Republicans need to show this video in Congress.
1,Hey Tucker I love your work man and your courage . Am in NZ and yes our esteemed leader it seems was trained by the best tyrants .
2,WHEN SOME PEOPLE HAD COMMON SENSE AND THE NEWS MEDIA SOMETIMES PRESENTED THE TRUTH! So sad those times are completely gone.
2,To bust the system every protester needed to turn themselves in to law enforcement go to jail and bust the bank account making them feed them it's all about the money
2,When will people WAKE UP and realize the sheer HYPOCRISY of this madness?
1,"This is the Democratic Party. Dangerous and hypocritical. Preaching we must all wear face diapers, while they go unmasked. People are hopefully waking up to the insanity!"
1,Good for thee but not for me. They are only mandating masks to turn us against each other. This happened to me yesterday at the Vet office where I was viscously verbally attacked by a woman and told to put on a mask. I was unprepared for this attack as everyplace is really left to your own discretion in our city right now. The only thing I could muster was I don’t do masks. She sat on the other side of the room videoing me and the whole waiting room and will probably put it on social-media. -I really don't care. Picking on a 100 pound grandma wearing a huge back brace from my recent surgery is how you’ll recognize me. I work on my health everyday of my life as I have autoimmune and back issues. I have felt great for the past 8 years and even more since this recent surgery. She needs to take a look in the mirror at what appeared to me to be a very overweight unhealthy individual and worry about herself. PS I still have the antibodies from Covid that I got while in the Holocaust museum filled with Chinese students here on their winter break before any of us had even heard of it. I was very ill for 10 days. PS- I LIVED!
1,"Tucker, our leader (the lady with the teeth🤣)
Just so happens she was the elected President of 'The International Union of Socialist Youth'
You can see her political beliefs have not changed.
We are locked down with under 30 deaths to covid total. 🤦"
2,Sounds like Australia needs to be liberated... send in the troops muhahaha
1,Australians let them take their guns a long time ago. Now they have no way to resist.
2,To bad the police are against their own fellow citizens. It’s hard to believe that the world is willing to give it all up so easily. I’m sure that soon the sleeping giant will wake up and heads will be hurt.
2,"Man, what the heck is happening to common sense and people standing up! So sad and disturbing!"
2,Politicians are and have always been more sophisticated than the rest of us tax paying types..
2,I like and Tustin to a lot of what you say. However. How about looking at the death rates and exposure rates. A fair bit better than USA and Great Britain. I think there’s something to learn there personally
1,"Covid-19 spike I'm Fl. Hmmm, could it be nc hundred s of illegal s were transport we there and was told the vaccine is OPTIONAL?!"
0,Good thing Australia already disarmed all there citizens.. lolz
0,"Just scary times. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻. Vaccinated and unvaccinated can still spread covid.
Forced vaccinations will hurt some. Medical exemptions have always been there for a reason. Common sense. Your doctor should help you decide this with informed consent. Some people think they are more important then others. No one deserves to die from covid. Access to antibody treatment should be available to everyone. It is humanity. No one is more important then another. I’m sad seeing this happen. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻💔. If anaphylaxis with first covid shot or obtain GBs or causes a stroke from blood clots. The injured then aren’t allowed in public places????? Because couldn’t get their card. Instantly. The weak physically are told it’s best for them to protect them. Scary. You stay home. Why I go out because I’m stronger physically then you. While they still spread the disease. It’s heartbreaking. 💔
If your vaccinated with a “cold”. It can still be covid and you can still spread it.
Need to enforce SICk POLICIES regardless of vaccination status. Not just punish vulnerable populations.
Next we will see voting rights taken away if don’t have covid card. I predict this coming. Insanity. Scary times!!!! God help us all!!! 🙏🏻"
2,Criminals in commissions of Crimes often wear mask too “Nanny Nancy”.... During the Civil War Slaves did too when they had no voice as their’s were leather and iron.... Doubt it??? Research it!!!!!
2,"Our health official in Nevada County, California referenced the Spanish Flu and jokingly held up gun fingers.

Everyone is so mad!!! We have called for his resignation. Dr. Kellerman. And our Board of Supervisors refuse to fire him for saying that publicly."
1,George Travancoor that’s why our governor relaxed rules on owning a gun. I’ll be ready for anyone that tries to force a mask or a shot on or in me.
2,"Do you notice how without a mask, Pelosi is still wearing a mask?"
1,"Australia is now in the grip of dictators, my once proud free democratic country, is no more. The next step will be a license to breath."
1,It does not become any clearer than seeing it with your own eyes . The elite and power hungry are slowly sacrificing the people of this country. The second amendment was put into place to fight tyranny and tyranny we are victims of until we decide to stop playing this game.
2,"Um as I recall, Kamala started the political anti vx movement when she said “But if Donald Trump tells us we should take it, I'm not going to take it.""💩"
2,"A million little restrictions can be accepted by so many, when they can’t stand back and see the big picture."
2,"So much for wanting to visit Australia, looks a lot like North Korea now . Never give up your guns, our politicians still fear us and that is a good thing ."
1,"That’s what happens when you freely give up your guns. Sadly, this is only the beginning in Australia"
2,"WOW! The New World Order has started in every country. The elite wealthy do what they want and the rest of us are a part of the collective. We are basically told to sit down and shut your mouth you are common folk, we are nothing!"
1,When we gonna stand up and just say no????? I don’t wear one even when asked I got the Johnson shot because my wife asked me to because of her job she takes care of the elderly as an administrator at a retirement home. But the people telling us we have to wear one a mask because it’s so deadly but don’t even believe it’s that deadly them selves
1,People can’t turn their heads anymore thinking nothing can happen here! It’s happening and Nancy is leadings it. She’s crazy.
0,They make the civil rights movement come back alive in a different way
2,My daddy said his mother told him stories of the government nailing doors shut to keep people indoors in the last pandemic. Did anyone else hear of this happening?
1,They gave up their guns and that's what happens!
1,"This said it all, look how brave our leaders are not fearing the virus"
1,It's not about a virus...if it was the borders would be closed. It's about control at this point...
1,I am Australian I can see the lunacy in this and millions of Australians do but we are powerless our government has also been hijacked by leftist communist ratbags and our police became the Gestapo overnight unbelievable
2,That’s because they are all brainwashed. If people would start standing up for our freedom and our rights.
2,"Yep, it’s nuts over here. Tucker Carlson Tonight in reference to the church gathering. They were dobbed on by people for meeting. The church was fined $5000 (AUD) for having no QR Code (Registered government digital contact tracing system) and 31 individuals were fined $1000 each. The NSW Police Commissioner also said he is considering closing down the church permanently."
1,Isn't that indicative of the fact that something is going on. And you can bet that the folks in power had protection before this virus was released.
1,The government stole Australians’ guns for a reason.
2,Leaders create this chaos then blame the cops who they force to control it. Notice their hands stay clean.
1,"Don't post this just on social sides post this on her page LoL.. if this would be a pandemic and be so dangerous and all this drama this witches (B) saying it is, there are the ones who would be in a bunker .. this is a control game and why is no one shows her or who ever get cut this pictures and late them explain it to us WTF THEY THINK THEY DOING .. EXPLAIN THIS where is the Covid .. so much BS makes my head spin.. and ppl believe all this covid crap"
2,Frightening how the sheep follow along... Australia is so far gone... we're not far behind.
1,But the first thing the government did in Australia is take their guns. Now they have no power to resist.
2,Why is this being tolerated by the masses??! We out number them.
2,"Those videos from Australia apply to Victoria and NSW, Most states aren't locked down, and it's certainly not nationwide. Having said that, people in Australia are pissed off about lockdiwns because the federal government refuses to address the continual leaks from hotel quarantine that are causing covid to spread."
1,"Im from Melbourne and i can confirm that this is all true, leaving your house will get you a $5000 fine but because people arnt paying the fine the government now wants to seize property to make up for it, its insane"
2,What is a “Mild Protestant”
2,The “slacker” who was shot was maskless in the street and a health inspector led him to a store to get a mask when the slacker hit him over the head and started beating him. The inspector shot in self defense. Both received charges. Google is free yall
1,"Terry Leef Abood you might like this. What's good for the goose isn't necessarily good for the gander. Really ticks me off seeing Pelosi and the rest trying to control my life. ""We the people"" are forgotten and in some ways dying needlessly to further their agenda."
2,They really shouldn’t be rich these dark elements in society they should prove and justify or go the hell to jail
1,the democrats are going to try and push this until the vote in 2022 mail in vote is the only way to win
2,"Where are these people who consider themselves "" elite "" going to run when the Country finally cones after them?
Like the mafia, there won't be anywhere that they can hide to escape the punishment that they brought upon themselves"
1,"America does not leave Americans behind Nor do we play nice guy with the enemy.
This is a posture of weakness. We will do what ever it takes . Stand Up Americans Wake Up
What this Administration is doing is Outrageous!!! I'm asking for the President and the administration to Resign. Get out of the way!!! If they don't do what it takes to remove them immediately Congress Republicans,Dem
ocrats & Independents Do your job !!! The Military can take care of this Listen to the Veterans who fought there.
God Bless Our Military and Veterans
2 Chronicles 7:14"
0,"Your reporting on Australia is in accurate. I am currently in Queensland where there is no Covid 19 and no restrictions, this is the same for many states. Sydney however has had an out break of Covid 19 D the state there is trying to get it under control, thus no large gatherings. The protesters were told not to go, as gatherings spread Covid. They went there with the intent to break the laws. We have been fortunate in Australia to avoid deaths from Covid and are proud to say only a few deaths not 1000s of deaths that followed uncontrolled riots like the US. Perhaps the way fwd would be to tell protesters they are banned from wearing masks then they would protest that by wearing a mask."
2,Sounding more and more like Nazi Germany by the day.
1,"If the video was in black and white, it would mimic a party on a plantation held by the good ole Southern Democratic Segregationist Party!"
1,It gives me the message that it's having trouble playing this video. This is not the first conservative video I have not been able to view on Facebook today. I think they are censoring again.
2,I can’t believe people still believe any of this show!!!!!! It’s disgusting and people need to start asking questions!!! Wake up!
2,Vote these people out of office that is how we will take the country back . Get out and vote in your local elections they are more important than we think ......
1,It’s insane my siblings live in Sweden and are in the medical field they stated they did not have tons off deaths and did not wear masks so again insanity
1,"The hypocrisy has turned into madness, thanks to the left. As usual there are no rules or laws that apply to the ruling class."
2,we all must stand together against any so called “ruling class” …
2,The police in these countries need to turn on there leaders....
2,Nancy seems to be remembering the issues for the 1918 pandemic
1,Unbelievable that they still have Dr. Fauci on TV and people are again hanging on to every word he says. God help us all! Only God can save us now. Keep praying everyone! Evil will not Prevail!!
1,Government officials police and the military are now Australian super spreaders each time they speak they spread covid
2,"For those of us, who had such a hard time understanding of how the german people before ww2, could allow the insane nazis to get into control, now we know!. All it takes for evil to triumphant, is for good people to do NOTHING!. America better wake up, because we are next!. - Mark"
2,"Ok Biden can save hime self.and amercians,, The talaban is not the legt government of afganistan so launch a drone and take out all leaders of taliban and put legt government back in place."
1,Australia has gone full blown communist.
1,"Never, ever give up your guns / weapons."
1,I bet Australians wish they fought to keep their guns years ago.
1,"South Australian here, yea the states under labor control (the leftards or democrats) who have imposed the most ridiculous lock downs and rules ironically have the worst daily case numbers in our country.. im in south Australia, and we are going to work, myself in civil construction, and dont have to mask up unless being inside a shop or the likes.. its the left wing ideology thats proven to be no help, but scare and anger the people.."
0,All good here Ellen is 6 weeks or so we will be 70-80% vaccinated and things should go back to normal. It’s stressful but at least we don’t have to look back.
1,"Thank you Tucker for reporting what is happening in NZ & Australia, you are a brave man, may God bless you and keep you always"
1,Only reason the population of Australia put up with a shutdown is Australian government took all the firearms. That is why we need to fight this government and keep them from taking away the second amendment.
2,Notice those in England and Australia who are enforcing these mask mandates and lockdown are not doing the same. No masks on either
2,Tucker it's the same in Ireland 🇮🇪 the elite politicians doing the same but no vaccinated can only dine outdoor.no pass no entrance to be seated in pubs and restaurants
2,This is China all over. CCP. They do the same to their people. Such a huge overlap.
2,"Tucker, don't you know these are all sophisticated, vaccinated people that are all above us servants who are the super spreaders of the world."
2,God help us. People must take control back before this happens to us. I shudder to think what kind of life my grandchildren have to look forward to IF we don’t stop this insanity NOW!!!!
1,"Have you noticed, if you watch this on utube , it is edited! Why? The pictures are filled in with Donald Trump in the corner, not the videos/ picture of What Tucker is talking about like the Pelosi gathering without masks. Why edited?"
1,We're being conditioned to accept rules for the surfs but not for the elites. That's why they keep throwing it in our faces.
2,I was just going to say that! During Spanish flew everyone covered up. Then WW1 ended and it kinda disappeared. Everyone masked .
2,"They break their own rules every..single..
time. Stand up or this will never end. Please wake up before its too late and we're doing what Australia and New Zealand are doing"
1,Australians getting arrested for going outside
2,"On balance adequate. The footage shot in Australia is illuminating, however; you did not emphasize that the Australians are putting up a fight--American
s are not."
2,"Your life means nothing to them and they will
Kill you just for the heck of it so You Might as well die fighting for freedom of your loved ones and 🙏💞🛐🇺🇸 and pray like never before"
2,"Unless your Obama and his guests i presume!!. Or any of the worlds elite, including Johnson and his hypocritical colleagues here in the UK."
2,"Tucker has been vaccinated...he
spewed his venom over that too. He's got nothing else to vomit about. Speaking of servants, how's that silver spoon taste Tucker? Nice name."
1,"Hypocrisy at its finest! they DEMAND of us, doesn’t apply to them! The thinking of leaving our American boarders WIDE OPEN is an open invitation to thousands more Covid in Texas and elsewhere! Sam Gonzales Lydia Gonzales De Vasquez what are your thoughts? Lisa Cavazos Darras Lisa Daniels Feldman"
2,"And yet nothing happens, evil is ruling, this seems like God's judgment"
2,"I have always thought Australia was one in kind with Canada discounting the weather. We here in Canada have seen similar instances in Toronto and Montreal. My main point is, are the police not there to protect and serve the people? This whole thing, even if there actually is a pandemic why brutalize your own! Nothing about these times follow any kind of straight lines. Rule changes at every turn, they say follow the science without any consultation or debate. Science now is what the government leaders say it is. Having had the illness is the best defence from ever getting it again, but that’s not very profitable and if they can break down your natural immunity with a few jabs well you might just be the next casualty and that’s worth a few bucks. To say I’m dissolutions by what has happened is putting it mildly. Well we will March on."
2,Politicians are famous for hypocrisy. This dingbat is on top of the list.
1,I think we’re all in denial this is communism. We all need to wake up
2,Didn’t Australians give up their guns awhile back?
1,"The Australian stuff sounds a lot like life here in Manitoba, until last month! Things are quite normal now, by comparison, but employers and schools are mandating vaccination. Sone of us are quite concerned about how that will play out. I think that just refusing will probably be enough. They can't legally compel us"
1,"FACT Check Tucker Carlson Tonight, “No one is Australia is laughing at this, no one in Australia is standing back far enough and seeing the lunacy on display” is incorrect!!! It is a minority but there are many of us who are not happy at all and seeing how crazy Australia has gone! The country of freedom has disappeared and now it’s communist Australia 🇦🇺 Very sad☹️ 😢"

1,It's because they can't have guns for defense.
2,"Hypocrisy has reached new heights in america and unacceptable.

We do not bow to the politicians who are supposedly elected to serve.

Today's out and have lost their way and believe they are designated through elections to rule.

Time to remove and fire those who believe politicians rule american citizens.

Goes against american tried and true values no matter how many statues antifa and BLM topple"

2,The Police can not be trusted anymore. when they know they are breaking the law and they attack citizens they are paid tyrants period. It will all come to a civil war in all of these countries. Its coming sooner than than you think.

2,"These elected hypocritical establishment figures all were caught in 2009 with the UBS Bank scandal that exposed them as having 52, 000 bank accounts not paying tax
... Anytime a US politician bureaucrat or elite go to Davos for a climate meeting they're selling influence and profiting in their offshore bank account where nobody can see it."
2,"Tucker, you keep this up and they’re going to put you in the same box with Trump. She will be tearing up your “address to the nation” speech behind your back with clenched dentures."
2,What the hell is going on??? Why would people allow their country to do this???????
1,yes it is pretty bad in Australia at the moment I live in Victoria and in the last year and a half we have been in lockdown for over 200 days prisoners in our own homes you are allowed to go to the shops Within five k’s for essential items and you are allowed to go to work if you are considered an essential worker it is pretty depressing Feels like I have wasted the last year and a half of my life gotten absolutely nowhere done nothing that is why there was protests over the weekend because a lot of us are about to snap yeah this is not the Australia I grew up in it is hard to watch it’s not right
2,You know they are going to say they were all vaccinated and they were eating so it’s okay! 😆
2,"So so Terrible Sad! I’ve been to Australia- I love Australia! Well I did, They’ve done lost their minds. So sad for the people of Australia 🇦🇺"
2,Breach of decorum lol... where's the picture of the forefathers wearing their masks while signing the declaration of independence...
2,"Ah, they have a cure for it they're not giving to the public. Think about it, we all know it's real. Her and the rest of these leaders aren't one bit scared of it. Why not? Why worry about us if they don't worry about themselves?"
2,Hardly a diverse crowd amongst the non help either... not really seeing many border crossers welcome.
2,"The scary thing is, is that here in Australia the media, ALL MSM is demonising the protesters.
They are giving them outrageous negative publicity.
These are the people that are going to save us, not hinder us.
THE PEOPLE ARE BRAINWASHED!"
2,So according to Pelosi all the men at her fund raiser are not real men!!!😹🤭
2,"No covid cases so far in the south island, New Zealand yet is still at the level 4 lockdown where only grocery stores, gas stations and hospital emergency services are open.

2,Wow didn't see the people serving wearing masks... I guess I shouldn't be shocked
2,Why not just put their feet down don’t send them to the collages which also means not giving ANY money to the colleges and they will be in turn shut down can’t run a college with teachers if no money coming in along with no students to teach 🤷‍♀️ makes sense to me
2,Will history repeat itself? Will Americans wake up to the power grabbing of its elected officials and return to making their own informed decisions?
1,"Notice New Zealand is being told that they have learned from other countries around the world that you can get Covid from just walking past somebody. What study did they get that information from? What other country did they learn that from? Or is New Zealanders being lied to?
Each country is telling their people something different to continue the lies fear and control."
1,Australians are ready for Chinese rule

1,"You notice The Prime Minister isn't wearing a mask, one rule for some another rule for others."
1,I believe in the 1918 pandemic that mask mandate was stopped because it was proven that it caused respiratory problems
2,"That is a bit excessive, it's people's stupid fear that allows this to happen"
1,Pelosi should have been required to wear a mask long before the coronavirus ever came along
1,But the mask police will say you can’t eat or drink with a mask on…

2,WTH tucker??? Where's the Afghanistan coverage????
1,If the ceo of Pfizer won’t take his own vaccine what does that tell you? If the CDC does not force its employees to take the shot! No one in Biden’s admin is forced to take the shot! What the hell does that tell you????
1,And people are willing to mask our children... disgusting and evil.
2,Totaliterism at its worst. So sad for the Australian peoples. My people too.
1,You know I don’t want to share air with palosi either. Can she hold her breath please?
2,"If one is paying attention, they can see the parallels being drawn between Australia and the United States. I fear that by the time Americans decide to do something about it, it will be just as Tucker is saying here - it will be too late."
2,How it should be now. Keep seeing the uppities massless and post all across the nation pics! Then maybe some people will wake up and stop the bah bah like a sheep
1,Saw that last night. She is one of the rich elite Demonrats. Not the peon worker bees like the rest of us.
1,Biden is full of it and why people listen to him is beyond me. 1st off Florida is not full of Covid with people dying left and right. Biden just doesn't like Governor DeSantis!
2,At our local school board meeting last night one father striped down to his undies and mask to make his point. He felt everyone should have to wear a mask. He said if others did not have to wear a mask he did not have to wear clothes.

Communism, socialism continues, look at all the examples worldwide."
2,"It’s coming to America, another shut down will be here because you know, it worked the first time!😠"

1,This absolute BS must stop. Arm yourselves because it looks like we are going to need to overthrow our sadistic “leaders.”
2,I think she is joining the president with mental issues and don’t remember what she says from one min to the next
2,I didn't see one person of color except the servers . Wow talk about a perfect picture of the hypocrisy from the elite
2,"Just say, ""NO"". They can't pass a law that they, themselves aren't subject to. Frauds, the lot of them!"
1,"Wear masks, take the jab, keep social distance, but don't forget the next wave is on its way. Keep it up citizens you are doing well with your communism course. Mind training is hard but you wil get there."
1,First thing I notice is not one person of color at Pelosi's fund raiser. Not one. So tucker ask the Squad why is that.
2,Mark Helmick He speaks of New Zealand's lockdown over 1 covid death and Australian lockdown. Martial law like I have only seen in old military videos.
2,All of her guests are also well into the risk zone age.
2,"Ok for me but not for thee! Control of us peons is the name of their game! When are we going to wise up to their hypocrisy, like the people did in the past!"
1,"What's that old saying what's that old saying do as I say not as I do, what gets me so mad cuz they got all these people coming in on the southern border no mask all these people from Afghanistan no mask and yet their own people they're making mandatory mask 😷🎭"
1,Stop arguing about masks and look at HR 4. They’re trying to take away states rights to require voter ID!
2,"I'm convinced that many of these cops are frustrated schoolyard bullies who couldn't cut it on the playground.

Bear in mind that all these illegal and tyrannical mandates would be pointless and impotent if COPS didn't enforce them. Let that sink in."
1,"This entire Administration is acting like an Aristocracy.
I think they are forgetting what happened to the last one who tried to rule our lives. Remember King George.
If I was a Democratic hippocrate I would be very afraid.
It just took only 75,000 Taliban soldiers to run us out of Afghanistan.
What do you think half the Country could do to Washington if they continue to attempt to rule us like a Monarchy."
1,Thank you Tucker Carlson Tonight for talking about the madness in Australia 🙏 Next week our truckies are going on protest blocking highways to voice their opinion on mandatory vaxx to cross borders.
0,Bet them aussie are really happy about giving up their guns now.
2,"I'm Sorry but I have to say something about this sound off of information about our countries leaders about the covid situation and what is in jeopardy here. BUT DID ANYONE ELSE HEAR THE REFERENCE TO THE SERVERS AT THAT $30,000 DOLLAR PLATE SPEACH ??? SOUNDED TO ME LIKE MR. CARLSON TUCKED IN THE WORDS OF "" BROWN SERVERS "" TWICE IN HIS REPORT ON THIS MATTER..
I DON'T MIND HIS REPORTS BUT I BELIEVE THAT HIS REPORTS NEED PROOFREADING BEFORE GOING ON THE AIR.
THIS REPORT WAS GOOD BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER."
2,Why are people not rising up!
1,"Please, tell me when they are going to ""finally"" start investigating ""Nancy Pelosi, the State of California and the office of the Speaker of the House?"
1,PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBWR- MANDATES ARE NOT LAWS!! This is all about CONTROL!!!!!!
1,Here in Victoria Australia we are not allowed to drink alcohol without a mask. Go figure it is not the air but a corporate regime for us to obey the words of the corporate elite nothing more nothing less. Sad really.
2,Australia is a penal colony again.
2,This was a long time coming. The new normally has been brought to you by the Old normal. Repent! Which means think differently.
1,Nor That woman have on a mask.. Why isn't anyone challenging these people. The news media aren't 6ft and none wears a mask inside.. yet not a sound.
1,the Australians made a mistake when they trusted the government and turned over their weapons
2,Repeating history of Nazi Germany... American people need to rise against this tyranny
1,"Im glad Jason Whitlock said it. Im glad someone finally said it. Its ALL satanic. Politics, entertainment, communism, LGBTQ, wokism, marxism; it all flies in the face of Christianity all the while they attack Christians of bigotry while never explaining a single instance. The Left attacks the opposition with the very thing they are doing. As soon as Jason said it, I was like THANK YOU!"
2,"The exact number of taxpayers dollars
85 BILLION in weapons, Aircraft,Unifor
ms,and Transport Vehicles. All left behind and someday they will be used against us!"
2,"It's a representation of how it's us and them. The workers are wearing masks but the others are too good for that, even though they preach it. They aren't even hiding what they're doing anymore!"
2,"Hey Tucker, love your show but you got it wrong about Aussie bloke sneezing in lift. Remember TYPHOID MARY - they locked her up in isolation for 20 years because she refused to isolate. This bloke is contagious and refuses to quarantine or self isolate. So I have no problem with them locking him up in forced quarantine (comparison to FEMA camps etc is a bit silly, really. It is just 2 weeks isolation which many countries are enforcing, and if he cops a fine or jail term for breaking the law, so what). Yes our Govt is insane, but that's because, unlike most of the world, they are still aiming for ZERO COVID, which is rapidly slipping through their inept fingers. And high school kids were NOT forced to vaccinate without parents in a stadium - it was totally voluntary, and many opted to not vaccinate. There is enough crap going on in the world to expose, without hyping stuff up - it just diminishes your credibility. Disappointed, but still a big fan :)"
1,So why is it the self ordained elites dont wear protection at public venues as Obama & his cronies did at his 60th B-day party on Martha's vineyard recently? What do they know that we dont? Hmm? What the hell is going on? Wake up Americans!
2,Canada is a few weeks away from the same gvt behavior.
1,The VP goes to S E Asia? I guess there really isn't a pandemic. Ignoring the border and ignoring the Americans trapped in Afghanistan.
1,PLEASE! a start going after the “do-nothing“ Republicans to draft articles of impeachment against the entire Biden administration and Nancy Pelosi. They must go
2,It's very true and iv seen more of this stuff going on all over the world and its dictatorship plain and simple and people need to waik up alredy before it's to lait
2,notice none of those marching were armed
1,Notice all the leaders are not wearing maks while telling everyone to wear them or else
1,"Yeah, that’s why no one at the event in which Pelosi was speaking were wearing masks, except the servers."
2,Time for the people to take back their countries!!
2,Any guesses as to gun laws in these two countries? Wake up folks
1,I refuse to wear a mask or stay home… I will wash my hands and not get close to anyone….. I have lives with someone who had it and even was in the Covid unit for 8 hours while my vaccinated uncle died…. I will NOT comply! Th was cops who are “enforcing” this 💩 need to grow a backbone!
2,I’ve watched people argue over whether or not Mr. Rogers would get the 💉. Like... 👀🤷🏼‍♀️ ok? 🤯🤯🤯💀💀💀 Are we really that far gone? Please tell me I am not a part of this generation. Please tell me it’s all a dream. 😅
2,"They’re eating, though. We all have learned by now that the virus is afraid of food and drinks. It miraculously disappears when you bring out those things. Duh 🙄😂"
2,I thought Australians were supposed to be tough people next they'll have you walk into an oven and you'll walk right in
2,Australia was once a penal colony!
1,Think about this she didn't like Trump so she is the one leaving our military behind she knows Trump loves them just like she undone the border knowing he was tring to fix it everything he was about she undone this is all control in all countries covid is coming around again do to all the one's that's been vaxed month's ago this is why they push the shots
1,did that NZ woman just say that the delta variant can be passed on to other people by simply walking next to that person? is she insane? where the hell are those studies everyone believes? no wonder people are scared to even open the window and get this flu....what a bunch of nonsense
2,New Zealand has a bunch of crapNew Zealand and Australia those people are idiots they're scared to death now that's cuz they're
2,"“Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.” Ronald Reagan
Hmmm is San Francisco reistaling that law? Asking for a friend.
‘Serious breach of decorum’ ?? Isn’t that the equivalent of eating a salad with the big fork?!? Everything I ever needed to know about Pelosi can be boiled down to her ‘hair salon’ incident from 2020, where she got caught with her pants down and claimed ‘it was a set up!’ Stick it, Nancy. What a trashy human being.
New Zealand is run by a woke communist its sad
The hipocracy though it's disgusting and appalling is not New or a Surprise!! On the plus side we can be happy they will ALL go down in history as liers, cheaters, hypocrites and crooks!!! My opinion of course.
Love your work Tucker Carlson Tonight but, we have 8 states in Australia, not every state is in lockdown, they like to take it in turns 🤣 currently NSW and Victoria are in lockdown, a couple of other states just have a mask mandate whilst indoors but you are free to move around, as long as you dont want to move around your country as most borders are shut and wont let you in.🙄
If there is anyone on this thread who can help New York go RED for Governor in 10 months.....plea"

1,"stionable election results!"""
1,"This is the women who fines The house of representatives
$500 for not wearing a mask."
2,Are media using the word servant on purpose?
2,too far gone America on it's way at warp speed
1,Obama had a Birthday party with possibly 600 guests of the rich and famous type and nobody wore masks. Mandates don't really apply to the elite in the democrat party or to some of their RINO friends because the mask mandate is about having power and control over others. The jews were forced to wear a yellow star on their clothing when outside.
2,"Decorum???
So they admit mandates are purely a matter of “good taste”, “polite behavior”, and/
noun
the state or quality of conforming to conventionally accepted standards of behavior or morals.

And has nothing to do with actual necessities??? 😒"
2,They shot rubber bullets point blank range (1m 2m distance) at that demonstration btw
2,Create civil wars so the Cabal can sell armaments...
1,"This is a dystopian world where servants wear a mask, and look all the same, while the privilege look down on them. Handmaidens tale."
2,"Look at it still way .
Being out doors yes less chances of getting the virus ,after having the covid vaccine.
Being indoors more chances of catching the virus."
2,Jeff Shortridge. Watch the end of this video where the police turn on Australian citizens. This will be America soon. Don’t put to much blind faith in the police. Support them but keep an open eye
2,they're at a table outside...who cares..we traveled all over last year..no one cares if your dining out and your at your table.....a stretch to try and stir the pot.....i'm sure you follow every law to the letter....mask and distancing should apply to only to the unvaccinated.
2,"Chaos caused by evil control.
This is all a sham
We will not allow them to take power from us!"
0,but pelosi can have a big party and not wear a mask. am glad that the waiters did because they could have been infected with all her lies
2,yes and is Canada reaching out to them and rescuing those people I guess they're not Justin's people losing its Justin's people winning
2,"pelosi is just the messenger?
get the big boss who orders these things?"
2,"What about her & other government, big pharma reps like Fauci wearing muzzles?"
1,the question I must ask is WHY are these police enforcing this ideocracy?
2,"Have a listen to Tucker esp. the person that posted on my Comments a couple of months ago ""do you really think mandates can happen""?"
2,Erika Loren what do you have to say about the people you support being so hypocritical? Especially ones in such a high-risk group?
1,So quick question. Based on the limited video. Does this event violate any of the mandates in place in that area?
2,Where’s old nana Pelosi on the debacle that is the Afghanistan withdrawal? 🤐😴
2,"Don't you just love the verbiage they're using to control people? It's not spreading...it'
s Surging. Raging."
2,"Hey bring me my food peasant,and don't spread your Germs you Germs.
Power Hungry Totalitarian politicians in Australia must be Stopped.
Freedom Forever.
Please help us America we ❤️you."
2,"The whole of Australia does not agree with this, trust me we are angry. We do not consent. I am horrified that they killed those dogs. At first I thought it must be a mistake, there must be another reason, but no they killed them to stop people moving between 2 country areas. Heartbreaking. These charges are all dismissed in court too, police were caught on a hot mic admitting that the rules were BS."
1,Australia is just working on getting ahead of the curve in becoming part of Oceania out of Orwell's 1984. Tyranny is cool! 🤬
2,Don't let Biden or who is running the goverment to touch anything else all he does just withers and dies he is leaving a trail of stink and slug
2,These videos are starting to remind me of news clips off of movies like robocop and v for vendetta etc its so surreal...
2,"They all feel like they rule this country,not work for it"
2,"""the public was able to endure inconvenience, but not hypocrisy"".

It was true then, but not so much today. Fully half this country are sleazy hypocrites. It's not just leaders that you've shown us, I've seen dozens of pictures of liberal friends partying without masks. Recently, when they were publicly chastising people for not wearing them.

I did not hear that the Australian Police State shot and killed dogs merely to stop people from travelling to rescue them That's disgusting, and I know that liberals here would love that. They don't care about dogs, about kids, about race, about anything other than themselves and their own power"
1,now if they want to play this crap ok then what if AMERICA decides too demand this then. if any server serving my food or any one in a store we need too see there papers of any other kind of health issues . cold flu any thing they need papers showing they are either sick or just getting over or other kind of sickness they had or do have.

1,These women need testosterone. Look at the decision makers…
2,I see the American people have already forgotten that Nancy Pelosi had a hair salon open during the quarantine and she was not wearing a mask then either.
2,Real men wear masks real politicians don't commit treason.
2,We are being enslaved all over again ! When will it stop ?

0,"Since only the good die young, this witch will live to 110. Only a lightening strike can save us."
0,So when we is everyone in this country going to stand up against the insanity? Seems many are ready to just roll over and take orders from their master.
1,Didnt Australia disarm its residents?
2,Once Australia gave up their guns things have really changed
2,manhunt for a guy who sneezed...I know it isn't funny but 😂. People have lost it.
2,They’ll shoot my dog? When did the ATF take over Australia?
2,"I'm usually on board with Tucker Carlson Tonight but I live in Australia (north Queensland, in Bundaberg) and we don't even have to wear masks let alone some of the other things he said about us. We haven't had a covid case up this way for quite some time now. Yes down south in New South Wales and Victoria they have gone off the rails, but it's not nation wide."
1,The pictures from the streets looks like Belarus… Creepy.
2,"I don't care about politics when it comes to health concerns....the
virus is real...it does harm people about 10 time more than the average flu...everyone should decide what's best for themselves. Everyone should also respect one another choices. Major local breakouts should be handled locally when hospitals are full. There is a safe vaccine and no one should die from covid anymore. Sitting here whining about just make us look stupid."
2,New Zealand 🇳🇿 is one of the most leftist Countries in the world.

2,"The small number of police are able to control these crowds because they single people out and gang up on them like a pride of lions and the rest of the crowd act like gazelle who’ve avoided predation.

The demonstrators need to get organized, focused and predatory in their approach to the police.” And turn their tactics against them.

By this I don’t mean do them harm. I mean subdue and neutralize them with restraints then disarm them and let them go."
2,Ohioan here in New Zealand…. He doesn’t even mention half of it!!!!
2,The only the only reason this is happening in Australia and New Zealand is because they took away your guns if you had guns they would not do this s*** to you Australia the people that are running it I hope your worst fears come true and Return To Hell where you come from

This man is on fire! 🔥👊🏻❤️"
1,This hypocrisy and elitism is ridiculous!! Wake up!!
1,"SInce our leaders have no respect for the founding principles of this country, Americans need to change this. General verbal attacks on the Democratic party aren't enough. Just as Democratic politicians like Maxine Waters told follower to get into the faces of Republicans, conservatives need to do the same to confront these politicians bent on destroying America for their own power. Protests need to be held at the residences of these politicians to interrupt their tranquility."
1,Do as I say not as I do! Total hypocrisy!

0,"Duh. The moment they think they'll probably lose, they immediately start fabricating fraud. Trump was talking about the ballots being a disaster before anyone even cast a vote. Was he the first president to ever get updates on ""the ballots"" in advance? Well clearly they get a lot of support claiming voter fraud, so this is probably just their new strategy when they don't think they'll win."

0,"They know they’re going to lose. But for them that’s still a win. They’re going to be much stronger going into the actual gubernatorial election in 2022 than they would have if they didn’t do this recall. That’s the point of the recall. To give them another campaigning and fundraising season before the election next year. 

Normally we wouldn’t be talking about who the Republican candidates are for governor this far out from the election, but because of the recall, these guys are household names now. They’ve already won at what they were trying to do. Hopefully it doesn’t win them the office of governor in ‘22"
0,"One of the characteristics of fascism is the public does not believe in the integrity of elections.  This serves fascism's purpose because then people do not vote.

0,"Also if they do somehow squeak out a win in the recall, statewide it puts them at a disadvantage in ‘22 because it means they will have a record they will have to defend. Imagine Larry elder trying to defend his record next year, which would undoubtedly be super unpopular. He’d lose re-election for sure. However, if he wins this recall, it will be good for the GOP nationally because they can push propaganda saying how even “crazy commiefornia” was fed up with democrats and chose a Republican governor (despite the fact that he can win the recall election without a majority of the state’s votes). They will use this as evidence to push the party further right and it will help them fundraise in other states, the logic being that if democrats are even too crazy for California, then they’re clearly too crazy for states like Missouri or Ohio. We really can’t let that happen. We’ve got to prove to middle America that our candidates are far more reasonable and pragmatic and that the extremists are the republicans"
0,"Sorry, when you suggested Larry Elder winning the recall, I threw up in my mouth  a little.

He could never win in California using conventional means. I think he has other positions in his sight. Her has made a name for himslef amongst the Trumpiest of Trumpets. He will lose here  regardless but unfortunately, we won't have seen the last of this person who was virtually unknown 6 months ago."
2,"His future is definitely something to keep an eye on. From everything I’ve seen from this guy, regardless of his political beliefs, he does not come across as someone who is qualified or ready to become governor tomorrow. He would be a disaster, even if we only have to deal with him for a year and a half, that’s a year and a half too long. But I expect him to announce his 2022 candidacy for governor very quickly after he loses the recall, and in that election, he’s going to get a lot of help from establishment republicans across the country, more than he’s getting now"
0,Oh god no. He is Trump times two. The guy would be a disaster.
0,"He would be awful. Crazy that he’s the front runner. I thought for sure faulconer would be. Faulconer btw is already running in 2022. So we’re likely going to see a head to head battle between him and elder next year. Would be cool if they split the vote from each other enough that were able to get two democrats running against each other in the general, but I suspect that elder will have the edge against faulconer judging by how CA republicans are stepping in line behind him"

Not going to work out well for GQP.

Fellow Californians:  the ballot is right there on your dining room table or wherever you put your mail.  Open it, vote NO, then drop the ballot off in the mail or at a ballot drop box.  There are ballot drop boxes all over the place and outside every library branch!  

Do it NOW--we only have a week! 

This REALLY MATTERS.   We have Republican chaos agents, running a terrible, anti-vaccine, misogynist, anti-voting rights candidate named Larry Elder, he's leading, and the way this stupid recall is set up, he could become governor if we DON'T VOTE.

2,"I don't know about lazy... we have a higher proportion of individuals either prevented from voting, or for whom voting is more difficult."
0,"In California, a recall election can be put into motion solely by getting a petition signed by a proportion of state citizens equal to or greater than 12% of the number of voters in the previous office election. As such, to force a recall election of Gavin Newsom--who won with 62% of the vote in 2018--only required 1.4 million signatures, or 3.5% of California's population. The recall is costing California $276 million and represents an attempted power grab by Republicans to take advantage of a non-regular election to unseat the democratically-elected governor.

According to the law, the recall is based on two questions: question one is a yes or no question about recalling Gavin Newsom, and question two is who would replace him were the yes vote to receive a plurality of the vote. So, technically, 3.5% of the population forces the other 96.5% to turn out in an irregular election to vote ""no"" by a plurality, or the most popular ""other"" candidate running (currently Republican Larry Elder with about 26% popularity) becomes governor. If a plurality votes ""yes,"" regardless of who they prefer, a candidate with less than 30% popularity can supplant the governor elected with over twice that popularity during a standard, regular election."
2,Yeah but they’re more motivated to turn out than the Democratic voters :/
0,You're on a democratic party sub mate... I don't think anyone here will be influenced very heavily by this...
0,"Recall laws in California are very lax.   


Only 65 signatures need to start the drive to recall and only 12% of the total votes counted in the last election needed for the recall to proceed. FWIW, Newsom beat his last opponent by 24%. However at 12.5 million votes cast, only 1.5 million needed for a recall to proceed. It gives the GOP a second bite at every election if they choose to take it. Seriously broken.  


I urge all California, left, right and center, not to sit this one out."
0,"The reason they got 12% of voters to sign is because Covid extended their time to get signatures by 3 months. So they simultaneously bitch about Covid measures and owe it to Covid measures that they got a recall at all. 

12% of voters shouldn't be able to waste the time of the other 88% with this bullshit."
0,"You are amazing for doing this. Is there anyone else you can call? You seem to be a trusted voice of reason.

This also reminds me of Nov. 4th. I had to call my aunt the day before to ask her if she is voting. She wasn't going to because my cousin (her daughter) always goes with her but had to work. I told her I'll stay on the phone with her while she waits in line, thank goodness I was working from home halfway across the country. So I listened to her random stories for an hour after calling 3 times to get her out of the house to the polls and sending her the polling location. 

She lives in NV so it was 100% worth the effort to get another vote for Biden. Then i convinced my exhausted cousin to stop at her polling place after pulling a double at work. +2 votes for Biden in NV! 

Seeing how close NV was warmed my heart for my little cross country voter outreach."

It almost seems hard not to vote yet you are convinced it is still hard for people? Which people are disproportionately affected? I genuinely want to know.

0,Watch Republicans slam companies for not supporting this for being “woke”.
2,"While corporate money in politics can be considered bribery, most of it is legal in the US. Many of these companies will fund anyone on committees that oversee their particular market, so just about every congressman, state or federal, gets political donations from big corporations, and if they are committee chairs or get lots of press, they get more, regardless of political affiliation, as long as that corporation feels they can expect preferential treatment access. Every bill is backed by congressmen who take corporate money. I doubt AT&T is donating to ban abortion specifically, they are likely donating to many state and federal-level stooges hoping they will regulate their industry in AT&T's favor. If those stooges also happen to be right-wing jack-asses? AT&T probably doesn't care."

0,GQP has NO intention in raising the debt limit. So just be prepared for that outcome
0,- unless the debt ceiling is raisedand ONLY congress can do that. its will be a disaster as GQP has ZERO interest in doing so. Let the chips fall asathey do with first chips?  Perhaps reducing govt payment of all types to redstates and redstate citizens.  ITs war so lets start responding in kind
0,"Republicans are still trying to sabotage Biden through a laughable debt ceiling. Please ask anyone of them, if they have any debt ceiling in regards to their personal finances? I didn’t hear talks of debt ceiling from republicans when Trump drove the economy to the ground with a mega deficit. Another laughable republican economic plan is their so-called “trickle down economy”, a Koch backed theory that the rich shouldn’t be taxed as it tends to hurt the economy. If republicans truly cared for the economy, they wouldn’t give tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations. Neither would they try to recall Newsom, whom despite the long lasting effects of the pandemic on the nation was able to balance California’s economy with a surplus."

0,I wonder if one of their motivations in passing these regressive laws is to drive out liberals and moderates from their state in an attempt to combat the possibility of changing demographics turning their states from red to purple and eventually blue.
0,"Perhaps. 

Thing is though, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin all are majority liberal cities. They get around that by the politicians picking the voters, not the voters picking the politicians.  Texas gerrymanders the hell out of districts to keep it red and there has always been complaints of election fraud that never go anywhere.  

The crew that is in charge now are corrupt AF.  Ken Paxton has been indicted for several felonies while he has been AG but he always slithers his way out. Dan Patrick used to be a big coke head and Abbott is just a cronies crony.  They have managed to completely fuck up that state."
2,It should not be this close. Not in California. This is worrying with the 2022 election coming up.
0,Just vote no. The recall is a fascist attempt by the GQP to circumvent democracy.
0,"American politics gives me anxiety. 

While I’m not a citizen I do live there on and off for work. Haven’t since COVID.

1,"Unions, AKA the *Democratic Establishment.*  (Also little old Black ladies.)"
0,"I'm worried too, but for this it's not really that California Republicans are gaining momentum. It's solely because of the idiotic rules for recall elections where someone can replace a slightly unpopular governor with a tiny minority of the vote."
0,"Totally agree.  When I saw the recall effort initially, I just laughed it off as more GQP fuckery.  

I just can't believe there are really that many people in CA that are in support of this.  Really not a good thing going into the midterms."
1,It's not hard. But some Democrats are disgustingly apathetic and I can't understand why. Why we're still playing games is beyond me.
0,"To be fair, it's really only in danger of happening in California due to their absolutely idiotic format for recall elections. Otherwise, Republicans would literally never be able to elect a governor."
2,Not Canada! That was supposed to be my safe haven for when everything in America  went to crap.
0,Yeah. It's too easy to unseat a governor who is only having a slight dip in popularity or if there is a motivated minority voting in a low turnout election. Plus the way that the replacement is selected produces a new governor with nothing near a popular mandate.
0,Isn't PG&E being held liable for for tens of billions of dollars in damages? Blaming that on Newsom seems like misplaced blame.
0,"No. Paffrath is polling at only 10%.

Good luck holding PG&E accountable when a crazy Republican is in power in CA."
0,"Are you referring to the PG&E settlement? I'm no fan of PG&E, but forcing the largest utility in America into a punitive bankruptcy wouldn't have helped anyone. The simple truth is that PG&E took our money for years and left us with shit infrastructure and we should be enraged at that, but we can't get blood from a turnip. 

Don't retcon the reason for the recall election to be all about the PG&E settlement. The recall was started by a racist, anti-vaxx former sheriff of Yolo County, who coincidentally was just diagnosed with COVID. It is fundamentally undemocratic to allow 12% of the electorate to replace a popularly elected governor. It might be legal for now, but that doesn't make it right."
0,This is why republicans are always trying to recall the governor. It's much easier than winning an actual election.
0,It's not democrats that are apathetic.
2,How's Mexico holding up?
0,It is misplaced blame.  Trump withheld federal emergency funds and his arsonist supporters lit the federal land national forest on fire in 2018. It's trump's fault.
0,I don't vote republican
1,"Yeah, but they *probably* wouldn't have gotten this one off the ground if Newsom was less of an arrogant jackass - e.g., violating his own Covid restrictions and declining to send his lawyers to challenge the deadline extension so as to not ""legitimize it"". So he shares some blame, but still far better than the alternative."
2,The cartels are pretty terrifying. How does New Zealand sound?
2,"I appreciate this sentiment, but people loudly complain about him going to an elite dinner party which was in a semi outdoors area wasn't really breaking his own restrictions.  It was a grey area.  But that isn't import because if it wasn't this it would have been anything else.  Enough people hated the restrictions that they would sign for a recall regardless and just parrot whatever rhetoric they choose."
2,"It’s all optics.  Democrats and Republicans are in an asymmetrical optics battle.  They constantly trounce us with this because democrats will punish their own for missteps, while republicans won’t. 

That doesn’t mean they won’t try to primary people who don’t fall in line, they do.  But at the ballot in the end they’ll always vote R."

There's no other fucking explanation for why they vote directly AGAINST their self-interest, time after time after time, year after year after year. 

Even though they're poor, their loyalty lies with millionaires, billionaires and corporations. Can you imagine being THIS psychologically manipulated?

They constantly complain about minor minimum wage increases causing inflation and higher prices for goods and services, not considering that executive salaries and shareholder profits are the actual problem. 

I'm CONSTANTLY telling people on Facebook that they're not going to pay $20 for a Big Mac if Billy Bob makes $7.45 instead of $7.25 for flipping burgers. Then I ask them if they're interested in seeing the quarterly shareholder report."

From there it's gotten more twisted. 

Ironically, the right and left DO share a common enemy. And if both sets of eyes were on the ball, things would change. Won't happen though. I think it's too deeply ingrained."
0,"This happens regularly in any other advanced economy though? UK, Australia, Norway, New Zealand etc etc. So you can do it. 

It's because Republicans have this fear of anything socialist. A fear created by the to control the few. It's to such a degree, these days ""communist"" ""Marxist"" are shouted at people with no real understanding of what those words actually mean but making sure they can wipe out any economic descent.

 they then go an vote against their own interests under fear of economic collapse cos minimum wage workers got paid an extra few dollars an hour lol. 

I worked out the other day, Jeff Bezos worth today 200bil (well few days ago) could pay all 798 000 Amazon staff himself for the next 8 years until he runs out of money.

To agree to a totally free capitalist society is to accept that this is fine. To keep going at this rate may actually collapse the economy, people will eventually revolt when the scales tip too far. When they realise we are billions and they are just the few."

When you make 40k, for example, and think that you are in the same league as Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson, you have officially become certifiable. Imo.

If one is so wrong surely it wouldn't be hard, certainly if you acknowledge it as wrong, you know the reasons yourself and can specify them for the public.

Especially with twitter who ban posts on covid they label as having a potentisl risk of spresding misinformation. By doing this they pretty much acknowledge people are incredibly credulous and naive. Otherwise why else would they ban it? Surely the individual could judge for themselves whether it is misinformation or not.

Besides. How do we reslly believe a corporation like twitter has our best interests?(As a citizen of America) They are openly are leftist and actively censor snd silence opposing views. Trunp is banned while we have terrorists like the Taliban alloud on there.

In my opinion they just censor opposing views because they know there is the fear of convincing them they(the poster) are right. In which they don't want that for propably some self centered reason or they want to maintain along with all other sources a monopoly on news with leftist indoctrination(Trans, LGTBTQ+, Feminist movement?, and whatever else.

I've seen this advocacy EVERYWHERE and a minority of conservstive or rightest views(atleast on social media)"

My interpretation is that it's just that Republicans constantly go on about how ""It was Antifa who stormed the White House, not Trump supporters!"" however whenever someone suggests creating an impartial committee to find and arrest whoever was at the White House that day, they suddenly get extremely defensive.

The Texas 'heartbeat ban' isn't medically accurate because there's no heart that early in pregnancy, providers say

""Heartbeat bills"" are misnomers because there's no heart nor beating at 6 weeks of pregnancy. 

Doctors can only detect fluttering cells that will become the heart, and call it ""cardiac motion."" 

A 6-week pregnancy is an embryo, not a fetus, and fetal heart development is a continuum.

The new Texas law banning abortions after 6 weeks of pregnancy, like others like it, is often referred to as a ""heartbeat bill,"" indicating a cutoff point when doctors can detect a fetal heartbeat. 

As Texas Governor Greg Abbot said in a Facebook video right before signing the bill, it ""ensures that the life of every unborn child who has a heartbeat will be saved from the ravages of abortion."" The law is expected to be challenged and, if it prevails, will go into effect September 1, 2021. 

But Dr. Bhavik Kumar, a family medicine physician and abortion provider at the Planned Parenthood Center for Choice in Houston, told Insider ""pregnancies this early do not have a beating heart"" — and that's a medical fact. 

For one, a pregnancy that's six weeks along is still an embryo. It's not a fetus until the 9th week after conception or 11th week after the last menstrual period, according to Healthline. 

Plus, most women don't even know they're pregnant at six weeks, let alone get a doctor's appointment to confirm it. 

""At six weeks, most women would not have any clue they were even pregnant if they weren't carefully tracking menstrual cycles, and that doesn't even take into account the millions of women with irregular cycles who might go six weeks or longer between periods as a normal part of their life,"" Dr. Stephanie Ros, an OB-GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of South Florida, told Insider. 

She said at that point, the embryo is a quarter-inch long. ""It's barely noticeable on ultrasound, we often have to use transvaginal ultrasound to be able to see it at all,"" she said. 

What's really happening is 'cardiac motion' from cells that will become the heart

The so-called ""heartbeat"" that's detected at six weeks isn't a heart nor is it beating. ""There's electrical activity within cells that will become a heart, and we see that on an ultrasound machine as a flickering that can be audible through the machine,"" Kumar said. ""We refer to that as cardiac motion."" 

""Certainly different people have different feelings around seeing that and what that means,"" Kumar added, ""and that is up to each person to decide how they value that."" 

Indeed, the president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which represents more than 60,000 OB-GYNs in the US, made a similar point in 2019 in opposition to ""heartbeat bills.""

""Pregnancy and fetal development are a continuum,"" he said. ""What is interpreted as a heartbeat in these bills is actually electrically induced flickering of a portion of the fetal tissue that will become the heart as the embryo develops."" That tissue continues to develop throughout the first trimester. 

Only in the past few decades has the technology been advanced enough to detect cardiac motion that early, Dr. Saima Aftab, medical director of the Fetal Care Center at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami, told LiveScience in 2019. The fluttering, she said, also doesn't indicate the viability of the future heart or the pregnancy. "
2,"I get it. I’m team thanos, I want less people on earth. If we pronounce people dead when their heart stops, then it's not out of this world to start life when the heartbeat starts. And if they did the bill for 9 weeks for the heart to develop, we would still have the same outrage."
1,"Cue the ""we need to deny welfare to unwed mothers who blatantly 'decide' to have a baby"" crowd."
1,"I really want to have a discussion, about this, No politics, no name calling, just a simple discussion, I understand what this article is saying, but I want to know why it does not bring up adoption, just give the child up to an adoption agency or surrender it to the hospital upon delivery this way the hospital can give it to an agency that can give it to a family that really might want it?"
0,"Funny because I, a blue state resident, is keeping red states like Texas afloat by the taxes I pay."
0,"How does that alleviate the burden of carrying a rapist's child?  How does that (to put it bluntly) undestroy their body?  How does that prevent the hospital bill, or the trauma of childbirth?  How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria?  How does that make it less of an economic burden to take an unwanted child and foist them into a poorly organized and definitely underfunded foster system (it's Texas, in case you think they care) that _mostly_ results in molestation, prostitution and abuse?  How does that not further the burden of guilt placed on someone who never wanted that child to begin with?

Utterly and completely destroying a good section of the work force, emotionally, physically, financially and in all ways permanently, (unless they have a neuralizer, panacea or a winning lottery ticket respectively) is not good for the economy.

And that's just considering the unlucky and unwilling mother.  What of her coworkers, or her significant other?  They have to pick up the hours or those companies simply do without, resulting in lost revenue, quality, and supply.  Have you ever worked a 12 hour double shift, or an 8 hour triple shift?  Because I fucking have, and I wasn't even involved.  Now you have to deal with burn out and turn over from an entirely unrelated set of people, time into training and damaged product or shoddy services resulting in slow-down FOR 9 MONTHS.  And that's if they can come back at all!  The U.S. at large basically doesn't even have a support system for pregnant people if you compare it to other first world nations.

There is no ""what if we try x."". This is a bad law designed to make broken homes that a political base can scapegoat and slavewage 16 years down the line.  It is designed to be economically expensive because that's _the whole point._"
2,"Do you know how much an abortion at planned parent hood or some other abortion clinic is? Honest question I do not know. I found planned parent hood says it could be $0-$1,500. but I am not sure what other places charge, I know in a hospital it can be 5,000 or a bit more for vaginal birth or higher for C-section. How can any women really afford a abortion then or delivery period then? 

You talk about How does that (to put it bluntly) undestroy their body? or the trauma of childbirth? How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria.  Have you seen the side effects of both a hormonal pill abortion or a medical abortion? For hormonal pill, it is not unusual for a women having to go to the hospital because the bleeding does not stop, but continues to get worse. Some women become sick and mentally damaged seeing that amount of blood and the cells of the baby after cleaning up that mess, During the surgical abortion where they stick a vacuum up there, it is not unusual for the doctor to cause damage to the uterus and other organs that actuary harm the chance of having another baby in the future, along with bleeding, and causing tears that might need to be surgically fixed. So you will have to go to the hospital for surgery. which case is all traumatic in my opinion. and more of an economic burden now they have more bills to pay. (not saying vaginal birth or C-section is better they all have their risk too)

to your other argument, why cant an employer higher a temp from an agency? There are temp agency that people do sign up with to find part time work, they usually work part time or full time during a short period of work, do you think those short term workers would like to have that job for a bit?"

I doubt it will go forward, but the more Bolsonaro continues with his threats, the more hopeful I am Congress will decide to get rid of his ass."
0,Bolsonaro is a Trump clone. So that’s not surprising.
1,Fake news! Wake up people. No one talks about a military government in Brazil. All you hear is people pleading military intervention to put a corrupt system out. Witch is not possible anymore thus the economy of the country would terribly affected. The military in Brazil already said this is not a possibility anymore. The government in Brazil is facing a terrible resistance from the old mobs since the actual president does not allow corruption.

In the Bible, when God removed Nebuchadrezzar, God made him so crazy that he left the palace and went to live **among the cattle**."
2,"Brazilians are clowns...I know it  ran away from the country as soon as I could. The truth however is more complex and it is not fully portrayed around the world. There are things, a few of them where Bolsonaro is right and on point, others show how ill-suited he is. With that being said, the options were even worse in the last elections.
The Supreme Court in brazil is the biggest joke there ever was, it needs to be completely reformed (The US supreme court should also be reformed, by the way)
The brazilians have a supreme court where ANY lawyer, appointed by a POLITICIAN can become a member, no need to be a judge, no need to be someone suited for the job, and that is a lifetime position! ANY supreme court that is unbiased and trustworthy need to be populated by FEDERAL JUDGES, appointe by election amongst all federal judges in the country, and I said JUDGES, not mere, ill-prepared lawyers. The political appointment process needs to be eliminated, and until it is so, no one will trust the courts. (that holds true in Brazil, US or any democracy).
Also, the voting issue, Bolsonaro is for electronic PLUS paper ballot, so it could be audited, similarly to the US...imagine an election where the electronic votes could not be audited? Yes, that is Brazil. But guess, the brazilian (comunists-inclined) opposition is against that. There is no transparency throughout society, and a society that has its powers opaque to its population, is a democracy of the rich and powerful, (like Russia, Belarus, China....and the list goes on) and all of these countries, including Brazil and US are heading that way unless structural changes are made....and those are usually painful. Inhave little hope though."
0,"You are saying shit. Bolsonaro supporters want a coup to keep Bolsonaro in the power as a dictator, it is what they truly dream of. 

Bolsonaro fighting corruption? Haha You must idolatrate  him to say this nonsense. 
Even the Lava-jato operation that has put Lula in jail he fought against. Now, we  know that his whole family is involved  crimes of stealing money of their employees in the government. He also protected the guy that as asking bribes when buying vaccine."
0,"I agree, there are a lot of reasons why Bolsonaro got there in the first place. I even voted for Bolsonaro in 2018, but because I was disillusioned with the polarized reality of that time and thought he represented a drastic change and action, but as it turns out he was another right-wing populist nutjob, and I slowly began realizing it just like many americans did with Trump. You rightfully point out the Supreme Court is politically appointed, but guess who appointed a judge who freed Lula from jail? You rightfully point out corruption is rampant, but guess who is the one who destroyed the Car-Wash Operation? Yes, Bolsonaro, because turns out, he is a corrupt crook along with his entire family. In the beginning, I used to believe that ""Bolsonaro is a fascist who wants to be dictator"" was just leftist conspiracy, but the more he began actually voicing against democratic institutions, the more I realized all these speeches about ""cleaning the swamp"", or about ""saving the nation"", or about ""the corrupts within congress"" have always been far-right dogwhistles and I had fallen this conspiracy rabbithole, which I have slowly been escaping ever since the pandemic began.

So no, there's no such a thing as ""communist-inclined"" opposition against Bolsonaro, because a lot of prominent right-wing political movements such as the MBL broke off with Bolsonaro, so his opposition is pretty broad even though there are indeed left-wing people in the opposition, just like every opposition against a far-right government. No, there is no such a thing as ""Bolsonaro is for electronic plus paper ballot"", because even if he was for that, the true intention of his when voicing for this agenda is to make people distrust the system and de-stabilize democracy so he can come out as ""the man who will solve it all"", and this entire agenda of electronic plus paper ballot is another dogwhistle for ""the democratic system is bad and I want to be dictator"". Yes, there is no transparency throught society and yes Brazil is a banana republic, but the ""twist"" is that Bolsonaro himself is part of the infamous ""Centrão"" of brazilian politics, you know, the ""banana politicians"" themselves, of the rich and powerful?

To summarize: the only thing Bolsonaro ever did for Brazil is to pave the path for the gangsters of Lula to come back and continue their legacy of corruption in the name of the poor, he destroyed the legacy of the sane right-wing who only wanted to fight the corruption of Lula and the PT, and most importantly: the deaths of thousands who fell into his far-right rethoric that the ""virus doesn't exist"", or ""if it exists, China made it up"", just like what happened to many americans with Trump. So fuck Bolsonaro, fuck his far-right nutjobs and fuck his terroristic ""milicias""."
0,"Highlight of the article:

> “Pelosi and Schumer have enormously difficult jobs — they really do — and it’s easy to disparage them, to criticize them, but they have no margins with which to deal with,” Mr. Sanders said in an interview. “It’s not a job that I envy, a job that I could do for three minutes.”

It's natural to be disappointed when we can't get everything we want, but let's keep things in perspective. With a 50-50 tie in the Senate and a mere 8 vote majority in the House, the Democrats are walking an ultrathin tight rope. Even then, they've been getting things down at a historically breakneck space.

This is not a time to be bickering among ourselves, the left of center should be united in promoting the Democratic agenda. Case in point: there are 49 Republican senators whose states are more liberal than Joe Manchin's."

What usually happens during a mid term is that the president's party will lose seats in both, just like Trump lost a large chunk in the house and a couple in senate, there has only been two instincts of it not happening and the president's part actually gains seats. I think the most recent was during Bill Clinton and the house gained during a midterm."

In 2022 the house and the senate will be up for election but Pres Biden will be in the middle of his 4 year term thus a “midterm” election.

I lived through the Reagan eras, the country has moved forward,  including LGBTQ  rights. Is it as fast as I'd like? Absolutely not - and why I'm involved in helping local candidates run for office.  Politics is slow AF, and the dems have a very large and diverse tent for ideas. Theres the old adage,  ""dems fall in love, Republicans fall in line"" which holds true and why we don't see th Qcult kicked to the curb (or tea party).

Yeah, it took trump to turn out the dem vote. Issue is, the ones who can and need to move the country forward at a quick step,  are millennials,  who just aren't old enough to be reliable voting bloc. 

The major focus really needs to be on un-fuhking the gerrymandered states and allow for more easy access.  This would truly ensure progress and provide a cushion /relax fear of pushing legislation forward that needs to be done,  and not worry about midterm backlash as the Republicans would be nearly dead in the water."

0,It's a little bit more complicated than you're presenting it. We're on the razor edge of holding power and barely holding together a coalition with moderate democrats. As a progressive myself sometimes it feels like this non yielding outlook is naive. In order to get what you're demanding requires us to make gains in the house and Senate. Throwing away your vote in protest almost guarantees you'll never get what you want.
2,I'm not trying to persuade you. You are as dense as the fascists.  I'm probably going to just leave.
0,"If you want all that, stop talking shit on Democrats and make sure they get elected.  I've lived in Virginia for 20 years, and for the first time last year Democrats achieved a statewide trifecta:  the governor's mansion and both houses of the legislature.  Since that time, Virginia has legalized cannabis, raised the minimum wage, secured voting rights, expanded public healthcare, passed environmental protections, and a host of other things you no doubt value.

You know how they did it?  By having a solid majority where Democrat legislators from more conservative areas could defect on certain issues.  Republicans did NOTHING to help any of this happen, but Democrats still had the numbers because their majority is solid.

""Both sides are the same"" is the stupidest, most counterproductive thing people are saying right now, and it needs to stop.  It's not based on fact.  It's something half-informed people say to make themselves sound skeptical and savvy, but in the end it only destroys any chance of making progress."

2,"Vote for the people who start the fire or the people who don’t put out the fire, either way you burn."
2,">ways of not doing it

They were talking about side options for companies and squabbling over nuance but it was a solid push for m4a with a few different flavors. 

>independents

I don't think so, they are democrats but at the edges of the current tent and appeal to progressives and *some* independents (and fringe ""libertarians."" Whom are often ignorant of what libertarianism is and want to be contrarian, or - and I contend, a large portion are made up of bots bad faith internet actors. Look at the Bernie subs and bizarre overlap with thedonald + redpill+ language).

Edit: this isn't to say Bernie voters are not real, I know plenty who were,  they just didn't act like or talk like what you see in those subs or online.  Most of the Bernie bros hate major portions of the internet (millennials) for security concerns.  At least, the ones I know irl."

0,"The Republican'ts are so desperate to turn this into a ""beige suit"" moment that they don't realize it's 2021 and it's going to backfire on them gloriously. Progress is coming, and progressives will need to VOTE! Slogans are useless. JUST VOTE!"

2,How is this Ken fellow still AG? Isn’t he under investigation?
0,"The right-wing Evangey Christian QRepublicunt party thrives and feeds on cruelty. Especially, on those most vulnerable."
0,Republicans always fear mongers regarding guns. If you pass laws restricting guns it’s just the beginning.  They’ll take all our guns away. Now they are literally doing the same thing with abortion and women’s rights.
0,Texas is turning into Gilead
0,"Texas won't secede because... Honestly I'm too exhausted to explain why the state can't at this point. It just can't. As for most rational Texans, we're American, or at least we try and uphold the things that originally made this country and state great, however those assholes ""in charge"" are very un-American, they spit in the face of those that know what it means to be Texan. Thankfully we have some elections coming up soon. 

As for stepping foot in the state, don't. You're not missing out on anything (honestly what the hell would someone even come here for?). Save your money and buy yourself something nice with it. Deny this state your sales tax. You want to hurt a man, hurt him in the wallet."
2,"I'm going to have an unpopular opinion here, but it is not all of Texas. It is the oppressive political system they are in and if they secede, the women affected by the barbaric laws they are making will have even fewer rights. 

I understand the frustration with a portion of that state, but the what the Democrats in that state have been doing shows the desperation of a large section of the population. The productive action would be to call for justice and national influence to be put on those passing these laws. Please do not forget that the state is not a monolith and you condemn all of them with statements like this.

Edit: I guess I didn't know how to spell secede."
2,"We need to invade. Topple the state government, arrest the leaders, all that good stuff."
0,"When I hear about people trying to harm native women and children the first thing I think ""This is definitely un-American"" 🥴"

0,And how has he not gotten indicted for being at the rally before the Capitol was ransacked?
0,Doesn’t mean anything to republicans. As long as you the brown people and liberals you can run any office.
2,You know what? You're exactly right!! I apologize to the good people in Texas who are trapped in this situation. It wasn't fair to me to paint everyone there with the same brush. Thank you for pointing that out. I let me temper get the best of me
2,How about Texas democrats start selling it better and fucking up the GOP instead.....when dipshits in Texas like Beto O'Rourke go on record saying he will vote to ban the guns most Texans have as a prime example...Texas Democrats look like they're just as fucki g stupid as the rest of the damn state.  Until Texas Dems get smart & sell it better to their rural constituents you're gonna get fucked up the ass every time.
2,"They're doing it themselves, notice how there's been no legislation at all concerning the failing energy grid and winter is coming. Those people are obsessed with cultural issues that don't effect their daily lives at all, unlike their failing energy grid. Darwinism in action"
0,"One of the major disadvantages of modern technology is the fact that idiots like the ones in Texas aren't weeded out at a young age. Technology has prevented natural selection, which would normally be a good thing, but not in this case."
0,"True, the lack of Covid precautions is weeding them out though, lol"
0,"It's ironic how republikkkans will give billions of dollars to rich, big businesses ""to help the economy"", but giving the average person money to buy goods that would actually stimulate the economy is a non-starter.

Keep people down is the only way they stay in power.

Instead of paying people's electric bills. Why not pay to have solar panels put on their house. But that takes money out of the pockets of the people giving ""OUR"" representatives money.

Hmmm....."
0,I am starting to think that they want the working classes to stay poor and desperate  so that they'll be easier to exploit.... am I wrong for this?
1,"Spot on, their language is also says the same.

1,"Garland has been a disappointment, ngl. To be honest, a decent amount of Biden's cabinet to me is just blah."
0,"By enforcing the FACE Act, protecting women that go into clinics with federal agents."
2,What was your expectation arrest Trump ? that’s not how law works
2,Women is protected by Texas law it’s providers who were in trouble
0,"Garland is only one among a line of lawmen that turn out to be wet farts; such as Patrick Fitzgerald, Comey, Mueller, Cy Vance… 

It easier to just accept that they aren’t here to help us but to maintain the integrity of the system."
2,"Yes, but the FACE Act, in its wording, protects both women and facilities."
0,"The thing is, if ""pro-life"" conservatives truly wanted fewer abortions, they would 100% support better sex education in schools and easier (or free) access to contraceptives, because those are the only two reliable methods of reducing the number of abortions. 

They go on and on about ""saving the life of the child"", but what about the quality of life for that child? Are Texas voters going to improve their foster care system? Will they support giving financial aid to mothers who can't afford the children that they never wanted? I don't hear any mention from them about what they are willing to do to support these unwanted children. 

Why are they silent about helping these unwanted children? Because they don't really care about the children. They only care about punishing women for being sexually active. They want women to suffer because those women aren't conforming to their conservative ideals."
0,"Pro-Life Religious Conservatives also love advocating for people who are on life support but will otherwise not get better. People who cannot advocate for themselves e.g. the braindead or the unborn are a great campaigning point for the conservative right because it requires no resources and allows them to both scare people and make people angry at the perceived moral backwardness of progressives. See this podcast about Terry Schiavo for a great example

"
0,Yeah no wonder rightoids chose the heart over the brain when deciding what’s alive
2,So what restrictions are we placing on men then?
0,"In all fairness, while a fetus doesn’t yet a conscious, they are still likely to be born (unless there’s a as opposed to a brain dead person

Regardless, before the fetus is viable, it has no brain function and is on the same level as a brain dead person. The heartbeat argument isn’t a good one."
0,"Republicans once tried to steal a brain-dead woman from her family to keep her alive as a way of responding to exactly this argument.    
"
2,Is it illegal in Texas to put the fetus on life support and then pull the plug?
0,"Well, I think some Republicans are smart enough to realize that if they outlaw pulling life support on people who are brain dead, hospitals would be overwhelmed with care for individuals who had no chance of walking out the door again.

But Republicans have no problem telling women they need to be life support for a fetus, whether the woman chooses to or not."
0,The same people yammering on about abortion being murder believe that pulling the plug on a brain dead person is also murder. Remember Terry Schivo?
2,These monsters oppose that too. No matter how much their grandma is suffering they will refuse to end her misery.
0,"There is no logic when dealing with people willing to do mental gymnastics to fit their square beliefs into the round holes of reality. Let’s not get into the argument of let’s force motherhood on girls but not force fatherhood on boys. Or here’s a good one that’ll put them in a logic loop, if an illegal immigrant is pregnant does that mean her child is a us citizen?"
2,"This is a messy analogy. Obviously a fetus at six weeks is “alive” both sides know this. A brain dead person is at the end of their conscious and a fetus is at the beginning. That’s the real difference.

I don’t think republicans chose the heartbeat detection because that means human life. They think it’s human life from the start. They just know they have to keep it legal in SOME capacity, no matter how minor. The heart best is a symbolic choice for them. And it just so happens to be before most women even know that they are pregnant."
2,"Thinking back to Terri Shiavo, I'm pretty sure conservatives were arguing not to unplug her."
0,i’m all for abortion but how is someone about to die and someone ab to be born comparable
1,Interesting argument but the difference is that braindead people will never be cognitive again whereas fetuses are still growing into cognitive people
2,Let’s go with just not killing people at all. That would be nice.
0,"Throw in emergency contraception as well(Plan B, or the “morning after” pill). Because people make mistakes."
0,"I was born to an ill-treated mother who hated girls, couldn't succeed in her efforts to in induce a miscarriage, and couldn't cope with having a 5th child at 25.  In my 60s I still suffer from the mental and physical injuries. I wouldn't wish my childhood onto anyone. 

Women must be free to choose, not just for their own sakes, but for the sake of their children."
0,"This is of course correct. They don’t want abortions to go down, they want women to stop having sex (except with them of course). It isn’t about abortion, it’s about sex and who they think should and shouldn’t be having it."
0,"Its 100% about judgment and control. If you allow free access to contraceptives and sex ed, you are condoning sinners. To them, its a sin trade- sex or abortion."
0,I’ve long held that any pro lifer that has their own kids instead of adopting is a hypocrite.
2,They should be pulling the plug on a lot of the COVID patients in ICUs. What a delusional waste.
1,I mean an abortion is just pulling the plug as well. The plug in this case is a womb.
0,"Everything that the religious right supports makes sense in the context of punishing women for sex and does not make sense in the context of preventing abortions: abstinence only education, prohibitions on birth control and lack of government support for families. At some point in time we have to stop giving abusers the benefit of their word."
1,Yes but the definition of “life” and “alive” can be debated based on what you believe. According to science everything is alive in some way as long as the cells are alive
0,That was one very public case. Brain dead people get taken off life support every day and not a peep from the right. They also have no issue with taking a human life if they feel the human doesn’t deserve to live(executions).
0,"There is no difference. 

Either you support life, or you don’t. 

The republicans do not. 

You cannot claim to be pro life and be in favor of the death penalty.

You cannot claim to be pro life and be in favor of someone who refuses to wear a mask, knowing doing so may kill a child."
0,That’s horrific and sad. So many tragic stories that get conveniently ignored by people who call themselves religious. I am so GD tired of these people ruining the entire world for everyone else. So tired and so angry that I hope they do not get vaccines and get to meet their sky daddy sooner than later. The preverbal silver lining.
0,"Woah, that seems to be quite a severe reaction to a joke about the unconstitutional stupidity going on in Texas. Guess you aren’t competent enough to have a baby or raising children either. Womp womp."
2,The type of people who shouldn’t be raising children include people who hide behind a screen and throw needless insults at strangers. I’m sure whatever little spawn comes from you will also be an asshole.
2,I agree that some of these people just don’t want what they perceive as an easy out for irresponsable sexual behaviors. Yes But a lot of these people very genuinely believe it’s wrong to end a human life in the womb. And not everyone who believes that is religious or even conservative.
0,"Irrelevant, neither have the right to use someone else's body or resources to continue existing. 

If a person needed one of your lungs to live, should you be forced to give it to them?"
0,BUT THE NEWS SAID “IT WAS THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT!” AND MY FRIENDS SAID “THEY WANT TO PUNISH WOMEN.” WHY ARENT YOU AGREEING WITH ME!?
0,"Why should it matter? It is an embryo not a baby. It is a woman's choice, nit the court's or government's while still not viable outside her body. Forcing a woman to carry is inhumane. Back to illegal, unsafe abortions?"
0,"""Noone has the right to use someone else's body or resources to continue existing""
The point is true in all aspects but it still extends way after a person is born, Infact, baby, children and even many teenagers may not be equipped to survive. In so the argument you provide also excuses a parent putting their infant baby on the street and leave."
2,"No. I mean, I think that’s a weak analogy. But yes, I agree abortion should be legal.

Abortion is killing a human. But sometimes it’s legal to kill humans. War. Abortion, endings brain dead people."
2,The media is full of shit on both sides. I believe abortion should be legal. I also think it is infanticide. And Im a Democrat. All these things can be true at once.
2,That is actually perfectly legal in many states - ERs and FDs are designated safe surrender sites for women who cannot cope with motherhood

2,"So let me see if I got this right.

A corrupt politician who is rich refuses to do anything to control the spread of a disease for which his rich friends are invested heavily in a treatment for.
 The politician then acts as sales rep to the patients who have caught the disease he refused to control?
Is that right?"

2,He wants to beat Trump in 2024.
0,The Cubans in Florida are no different to being dictators as Castro is.  Cubans don't be in democracy as long as it benefits only them and don't believe in social welfare.
0,Kevin McCarthy should be criminal charged for obstruction of justice.
2,"Thing is they know they are screwed.  No matter how angry anyone is over covid restrictions, voting matters, abortion etc.  They have started to erode away without providing the entire squirrel to chase.  They also realize younger generations DONT FALL FOR THIS SHIT and their days are numbered.  Get out and vote."
0,"Everyone should look for the republikkkans FB, TWITTER, any social media posts from the Jan. 1st- 14th and send a copy, screen shot to the house Jan. 6th committee.

Just, like ""they"" are using to suppress women's  rights in Texas. Vigilante justice for them."
0,They are actively engaging in obstruction of justice. So much for the law and order party.
0,While we are still waiting for Trump to be charged lol - If only law was equal for everyone.
2,"If the truth intimidates you, then you’re probably a criminal."
0,McCarthy must feel he can be very blatant and get away with it.  I mean threatening the phone companies with retaliation...that's pretty obvious.
2,They have been in the crosshairs for months. When will the committee stop delaying and pull the trigger.
2,I wonder if anyone is actually scared of these treasonous shitheels.
0,I can't help noticing how with all the disastrous weather events lately with people losing everything they own and being put out on the street in the middle of a pandemic that the Evangelicals and their pet politicians who have no ability or interest to perform governing to aid or assist people continue to lie and actively hurt people instead- it's like I never knew before that such morally bankrupt people existed in this country before.
0,They are actively engaging in obstruction of justice. So much for the law and order party.
0,"YEA we all noticed Kevin McCarthy, John Joseph Gotti routines  he done to the Telcom companies and like most dumb ass crooks he did pay attention when  Attorney General Garland gave them a blank check to investigate by any means necessary"
0,The courts are a political football now... pack them and get so much of the progressive agenda pushed that these American talibanners migrate to Afghanistan!
0,"I have been thinking of doing this, I am in Adam Kinzingers district, and I know they are going to try to primary him with some real knuckledragger trumper. Then vote for the Democrat in the general. At least then get the lesser evil because the Republicans will most likely win in this district, unfortunately."
0,"You wanna know why domestic terrorists aren’t treated like taliban? Because the gop counts on these buckets of shit to vote for them. These sociopathic, “christian” jihadist incel terrorists are the bread and butter voters for the rethugs."
0,Fun fact: Both are far-right and racists. :D
2,"Are they both driving Toyotas?

However, the bottom pic is of Afghan police, not Taliban fighters.  "
2,Y’all-Qaeda
0,Wow! I thought Toyota was the preferred weapons platform of the third world. It looks like the Taliban is helping Ford make inroads! There’s more than one similarity between the far right and the Taliban.
0,Very scary.. but True! We have many Trump supporters in my town... I'm afraid😳.
2,"Bruh the on top are holding paintball guns rather be shot by paintball than the taliban.

I'm going have to clarify. No gun has a container on top. No gun has a big as air compreaser on the bottom and if any gun has that stock on the bottom like that has to have some big ass recoil because the barrels of those guns are way to big for any bullet. This is just stupid zoom in if you have too. Compare it to stock paintball guns ."
0,"I will never understand black Trump supporters...black republicans, meh I guess... But black Trumpers are fucking mind boggling."

2,Now ford is the terrorist truck what happened to Toyota!
0,"So, what if the fishy right-wing terrorist got the idea from Taliban terrorists?  Is this one reason that stuff could have been restricted?  How many other techniques did they copy?  Yuck.  They could even have talked to the Taliban online.  I think I remember that stuff being up, though I didn't look it up.  I don't want to be dumb."
2,These are the pictures they want the world to see. It really benefits other certain countries when we’re brought to a third world level.
1,"If we ""far-right terrorists"" are like the Taliban does that mean we get automatic weapons too?"
2,"fun fact,  a paintball gun doesn't kill anyone.  this in an embarrassment comparison"
2,Very scary paintball guns
1,"lol, that is rather stupid…not mentioning that actual Democratic leaders gave Taliban so much equipment, that most countries would have problem competing with it haha"
2,So similar. Both obviously shooting to kill. Get these hooligans out of the streets.
2,They aren’t the same and you know it. If you keep comparing them to stuff like that they’ll just radicalize even more on their stance and hate y’all more. Maybe just maybe try to not degrade the other side? And try to sympathize? Yall the party of peace and tolerance but it seems to me that the other side never blatantly insults y’all.

In fact his New Deal policies are still glorified in High School today, all while glossing over how he segregated the TVA and ordered the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII.

0,"Well, if you know it and it's in the NYTimes, he's hardly covering it up; at least not very effectively. The Taliban probably want to be a legitimate government recognized by other governments. Of course, they will still be a traditionalist patriarchal theocracy; in other words, a Christian Dominionist and Evangelical wet dream.

I mean if they're supposed to be so damned hot about Western Civ, what do they know about it? Is it just the part where they dress up in tactical gear and pick street fights? Because, honestly, I don't think that's just a Western thing.

It is quite an irony that the truest defenders of Western Civ are our ~~nefariously leftist~~ liberal-arts universities thought, by the right, to be such hotbeds of leftist indoctrination."
2,Thanks for explaining. I should have done more research into them. I just kinda wrote them off after hearing about them during the election.
1,I'm proud to be American too. What's dangerous about them exactly?
2,"Right so if you’re bad at covering something up, that makes it okay? What are you saying? And why won’t you just call the Taliban terrorists like they are? That’s not really a controversial label. And also, how can you say Trump was “siding” with the Taliban by making deals, but then when Biden misjudges the Taliban’s invasion, and is forced to make deals with those terrorists directly BECAUSE OF HIS OWN MISTAKE, the Taliban is just “the ones that have to be dealt with”. Yes, they are now, but please think about WHY and how that could have been avoided.

Trump was an absolute idiot and a creep, but it’s ok to criticize Biden when he messes up too."
2,"I believe I've seen the shortened version of that video before... But even then, the arguments they were giving were all superficial and no real substance involved. I also noticed the black conservatives also tried to dominate the conversation for the most part...and it kinda still all backs to conservative view points of ""I've got mine, fuck you guys"""
2,Why do you call them leftist?
2,Mostly the violence
0,"Quite right. I thought the tone was visible, but it wasn't, so I edited my post. Our universities have a wide range of political stances, but the accepted trope on the right is that all the professors are either Marxist Svengalis or virtuous right-wing conservatives hounded out of academe. Of course, it's idiotic. Just ask Hawley or Cotton, those Harvard prettyboys."
2,"Um, not really. It's not like it's a Western Civ book club that has one guy who broke a window and now the WHOLE CLUB is unfairly branded as window-breakers. The point of the organization is to incite street fights and parade around in uniform. Often with police, invited or not. In this, they are little different than the English blackshirts.

That they make noises about Western Culture doesn't impress me any more than do the noises jihadists make about religion."
2,"I was asked a question (that has been deleted) about ""what civ"" I'm ""proud"" of. Interesting question!

I was raised steeped in Western culture. Grandparents in the German film industry, photographer dad, actress mom. They taught me (some) German and French. Went to international school. Studied physics and medieval studies in a college with a Great Books program. 

I can't think of a better way to spend an afternoon than at the Met or MOMA. 

Am I ""proud"" of Beethoven and Mozart? I had nothing to do with them. I enjoy them, I love them, I am deeply moved by them. But pride implies personal achievement. Just look it up: 

1. feeling deep pleasure or satisfaction as a result of one's own achievements, qualities, or possessions or those of someone with whom one is closely associated.
""a proud grandma of three boys""
2. having or showing a high or excessively high opinion of oneself or one's importance.
""a proud, arrogant man""

I am quite proud of a short play I wrote that got a good review in the NY Times. It brought me to LA where I met my wife who was a TV writer. (Our little joke is that we met through the NY Times.)

I am proud of my father's work, with which I had little to do, but I helped him in the darkroom and changed his film sometimes. 

I work in the space program and I'm proud of that, though I'm in a support position and have nothing to do with designing or selecting missions.

But to be ""proud"" of Monet or Voltaire just seems bizarre to me. I love them and would defend them, and I'm deeply moved by them, and would be devastated if the works were destroyed. But pride doesn't enter into it."
0,But Manchin and Sinema believe the filibuster (a senate rule) is somehow more democratic than the enumerated rights such as the 14th and 15th amendments of the constitution.

We need to return to the stand and talk filibuster.  When you sit, you quit. Then we vote."

2,"It’s not just Manchin and Sinema. 

Joe Biden also wants to keep the filibuster."
2,Agreed! A senate rule shouldn’t outweigh rights given under the constitution.
0,"That’s what concerns me too. If we eliminate the filibuster and the GOP grabs the majority? Texas’s law will look like child’s play compared to what could be done at the Federal Level.

Personally? I think that we should go back to the old filibuster rules(talking nonstop until the speaker wears out)."
0,"The last time republicans took over the senate, McConnell eliminated the filibuster. That’s how they confirmed all those federal judges and SCOTUS conservative judges. So yeah, Manchin and Sinema are pretty naive to believe if republicans win the senate, the filibuster will still be around."
1,"Lol, yeah. The GOP has really shown a pattern of following the rules in the past. 

This shit right here is why the Dems, who represent like 60% of the country's population, can't get anything done. When the GOP get power, they fucking use it. When the Dems gets power, they waste 18 months trying to be polite and bipartisan, then get fucking crushed in the midterms.

Voting rights, reproductive rights, climate efforts, income inequality reduction, and every other democratic effort is going to fail in the name of tradition and decorum."
0,It’s fun how you think McConnell isn’t going to eliminate the filibuster at the first available opportunity the moment they take control in 2022.
0,"And please understand abortion is nowhere to be found in the Bible nor the constitution. BTW, anyone who believes in pro-life should back vaccines and mask mandates aimed at saving lives."
2,"Biden’s era of good governance is way behind us. His years in the senate are very different from what we’re seeing today. During Trump tenure, we’ve seen a complete erosion of moderates and bipartisanship in congress. The guy is like a high school kid asking for his BFF to fight on his side. Biden can’t get his agenda passed, unless either Manchin and Sinema stop annoying us with their “filibuster is democracy” non sense, or republicans won’t use it to sabotage the democratic agenda."
0,"That’s what concerns you? 

What concerns me is McConnell absolutely eliminating the filibuster just to punish Dems for talking about doing so, and everyone being all “he can’t do that” as he proceeds to do it, followed by “well nothing we can do I guess.”"
0,"If you don't get rid of the filibuster then the GOP wins the midterm elections.

Then they get rid of the filibuster.

Then they take away your right to vote"
2,"That was the so called nuclear option, and was voted in by democrats during the previous administration. Lets not make the same mistake again."
0,"Go for it then, and end the filibuster, and then come on here crying because the GOP got a majority and used your rule against you. They didn't write the nuclear option, we did, now you crying cause they used it. They didn't break any rule, they used the rule we wrote."
1,"It's fun how he used a Democrat rule to do it last time, and people like you can't understand how every new rule you put in place can and will be used against you. It feels good for the moment though, right. How's watching everything you accomplish with that rule get torn down in 2022 gonna feel."
2,"It. Is. Not. Just. Manchin. And. Sinema. 

I’d be willing to wager there are around 8-10 Democrats who would vote to protect the filibuster if it came down to it on the floor."
2,"My biggest fear about Biden, once I realized he was the only one who could win against trump, was that he knew how serious this moment was, but wouldn’t step up to it. 

My fears are being proven true every single day."
2,"They could’ve gotten rid of the filibuster when they had slight control…but didn’t….why?

Because they knew that getting rid of it would mean that every time the power structure changed, previous legislation could be undone with a simple majority."
2,"Sure, but you don’t use the nuclear option when convenient, for the simple fact, it overrules the filibuster."
1,"
Why were the democrats forced to go nuclear? You know why. Cut the “it’s the democrats fault for going nuclear” crap. 

Would you rather they just shrug their shoulders and do nothing? 

‘Come on."
2,Well... they actually are the ones who ended filibusters for supreme court justices.
2,"I won't be complaining, but to be fair I've completely given up on this shit hole country. We've got like 2 actually liberal senators, 52 conservatives, and 46 who are very concerned on Twitter. I'm just hopeful I can emigrate before it gets much worse."
2,"Imagine thinking the filibuster is gonna save us after Republicans take control in 2022. 

Wow. 

You clearly haven’t been paying an ounce of attention, have you?"
0,"Quote it. And please, I don’t want to hear “thou shall not kill” that’s not abortion."
0,"Again, Biden grew up in a very different era of good government and don’t expect him to change. McCain was from his era and so “were” Lindsay, Collins and Murkowski. But since Trump came in, it hasn’t been the same on the republican side of the aisle. Not that Biden isn’t doing anything wrong at all. In fact, he’s on the right side of history. We’re simply faced with a different era of bad government led by conspiracy theorists in congress and state governments with ZERO knowledge of American government and history per se."
2,"You have no idea why they did what they did.  

I was a lifelong Republican, until 2017.  The GOP of today does not resemble the GOP of 2015."
0,"So you mad about the Republicans using a procedural rule that Democrats came up with to do something you didn't like. And using that as justification to make an even more easily abused rule because it benefits you at the moment, with no concern for the Republican abuses that are almost guaranteed.  Talk about short sighted."
0,"Huh, I’m saying that the only thing the Bible says about abortion is a recipe for, quite literally, performing an abortion, commanded by God, in the tabernacle nonetheless. I don’t know what “thou shalt not kill” has to do with it. 

"
0,"We’re going to have to agree to disagree. 

Maybe it’s because I’m 38, and my entire adult voting life has been watching bad government and watching the Republicans win, even when Democrats have power. 

Trump isn’t the beginning of something, he’s the culmination of decades of bad government on Republican terms. He’s the inevitable endgame of the Republican Party. 

If we can’t expect Biden to change, then we deserve to lose in 2022 and he deserves to be impeached by the Republicans in 2023. 

Historians in free countries— which won’t be ours— will look back and consider this all to be a progression, not a sudden shift from good government to bad government with the election of Trump.

The election of Trump was the natural reaction to America daring to elect a black man, and you’d better believe Republicans will burn the country to the ground before they ever see Kamala Harris in the Oval Office. 

We our on borrowed time, a narrow window, and Biden is counting on institutions to save us when they have already failed."
0,"You’re looking at the whole thing from your own simplistic point of view. You do know republicans became the party of “NO” under Obama right? They wouldn’t allow democrats to pass any bills at all. Please don’t make this about me. Unless you understand that republicans spend their entire terms in congress sabotaging democrats, this conversation is futile. Many republicans came by and went, but Gingrich, Boehner, McConnell and McCarthy have been the worst in modern history. Democrats legislate, republicans on the other hand, spend their entire time resisting democratic legislations without offering any alternatives. Pro-life and white supremacy aren’t what make the nation move forward. When was the last time republicans introduced any bills for the general welfare? Tax cuts for the wealthy?"
1,"I’m 100% sure the person living in the fantasy world is you, who for some reason thinks the filibuster is part of the Constitution and will save Dem progress. 

Bless your angry heart."
1,"Anyways, let’s come back to this conversation in about two and a half years when McConnell ends the filibuster and you act surprised about it. 

It’ll be right around the time they’re impeaching Biden, just because they can.

Can’t wait to say I told you so. 

But, sure. The filibuster, man. Totally the savior of American democracy."
0,"Yeah, Moses’ Book of Numbers. I thought you were against abortion and my only point was that republicans keep throwing their anti-abortion stances out there and it’s apparently based on Christianity, yet they’re unable to prove which scriptures in the Bible ban it."
0,"This passage from Numbers is always mentioned and always dismissed. Most pro-life people will interpret this as a recipe for causing sterility, not abortion. Either way, pretty disturbing."
0,"In modern history and right after Gingrich, the only time republicans were this extreme was when Obama came in. No one is saying there was never any disagreements between democrats and republicans, it’s expected and as a matter of fact, it’s part of the democratic process in which the system of checks and balances is based on and compromise being the ultimate outcome. And yes, Trump did finalize the radicalism of the Republican Party that went directly after the very institutions of the federal government. That’s not disagreements, it’s anarchy, sedition and treason. I’m fully aware of the racist, anti-semitic, homophobic, Islamophobic and sexist agenda of the Republican Party to attend to its confederate base, but it didn’t amount to an insurrection on the Capitol until Trump came in."
1,"Yea, like 4 years under Trump being the no party. Grow the fuck up and try and understand that you can't do anything that they can't do. Make a new rule, they will show you how to use it. But by all means do what feels good for the moment. Who cares if they use it to pass a national abortion ban in 3 years."
2,"“The only time Republicans were this extreme is when Obama came in.” 

Sigh. 

You’re very close to getting it."
0,"“Make a new rule, they will show you how to use it.” 

Guess the Democrats should just continue to play chess with rules according to how Republicans want them as the pigeons shit all over the chess board, then."
0,"You jumped to Obama without paying attention to my comments on Gingrich first. I can go all the back to the very beginning with the founders. Do you want to start to Thomas Jefferson? Because I’m pretty sure, the crisis we’re dealing with as of now is due to DJT and his Russian backed QAnon. BTW, I know what the fake Tea Party did. This thread simply isn’t dealing with that topic. Trump launched a failed coup d’état, that’s an attack on the entire United States government."
2,"Continue to follow the fucking constitution, and rules that have stood for a hundred years. Make some new ones, and you better believe they are going to show you how to use them."
0,"And you’re, for some reason, just forgetting about that whole era when Republicans embraced McCarthyism, or maybe that’s just good government.

Or when the Republican Party embraced the southern strategy. 

Or when the Republican Party essentially stole the 2000 election. 


Again, the crisis we’re dealing with now did not start with Trump. 

The insurrection on the Capitol was the inevitable conclusion. 

McCain gave us Sarah Palin. 

Murkowski and Collins and Romney aren’t the good guys that are going to help us save democracy. 

There are no moderate Republicans, and haven’t been any moderate Republicans in a long time. 

We’ve had multiple opportunities to stop this crisis from unfolding, it’s just the Democratic Party, in spite of all evidence to the contrary, continued to at least pretend to believe the GOP was operating in good faith, until the insurrection happened. 

Anyways, I think we’re both basically in agreement and on the same side. 

I just think our crisis began well before Trump and the insurrection happened."
0,"It’s fun how you think the Republicans are gonna give a damn about the Constitution when they take back control in 2022.

Anyway, the filibuster wasn’t originally part of the constitution."
0,"Democrats need to finally learn from the GOP. Judges, nobody gets approved during an election year unless it's Dem appointed PERIOD, NO EXEPTIONS EVER. With the abortion law in Texas, Dems, listen to me, USE THIS PRECIDENCE TO GO AFTER GUNS. In the Dem states, outlaw all firearms and use the people to enforce it. That's the key, if the State isn't enforcing the law, the law can't be challenged, law stands. Come on Dems, I know it's not in your passive nature, but let's get tough, it's time. ""But we don't want to stoop to their level"", grow up and start winning for once"
0,"This is so true. We consistently underestimate the ruthlessness of the GOP, and refuse to take a stand no matter how badly they abuse us."
2,"Going hard left is really a bad idea, you've got a lot if support right now from moderates like me.l"
2,"> Opinion

Fact, actually."
0,"If GOP cheats and lies, then they aren't ""for America"", right?

They should be dismantled for being anti-American, or unconstitutional, or something. They are making a mockery of our country, and Not supporters at all, right?"
2,"So very true.

When your objective is destruction and division your job is  much easier than actually trying to build something."
0,"Universal Healthcare. Abortion Rights. Voting Rights. Climate Change Policies. Are not going hard left. These are basic facts of most if not all major economies. 

In Canada “going hard left” is talking about UBI or drug program (already available for 65+) or free dental care. 

“Moderates” in the US need to look at how the rest of major economies work."
2,"Standing still and status quo are not providing any results. 


So what else you got?"
0,"There is no such thing as a moderate democrat at this point. A good example is Joe Biden. Joe is now, because the GOP has shifted so far right, basically a 1980's republican. You are either progressive or in the wrong party."
0,"Well…..that’s what the GOP does. They minimize their failures and maximizes others.

And don’t say that “both sides are the same”. This meme is the first I knew about the four killed in Niger."
0,And the twice impeached failed president [stopped going to Dover airforce base to pay respects to the fallen Soldiers](
2,"My headcanon about this is that Sean Spicer convinced him it didn't happen because if he did deliver remarks about it, there was a 100% chance of him mispronouncing 'Niger' on camera."
2,Thanks now I can pass this info on to my Republican Father.
0,"By putting our ally Chad, on the no fly list, trumpy caused the death of these four soldiers. When trumpy did this, Chad immediately pulled their soldiers out if the area. It was the first day going out looking for insurgents without the aid of soldiers from Chad. Why weren't there tons of investigations into this? Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi, though."
0,"So the trouble with the right wing is that nothing is hypocritical to them because the way they think is that as long as it serves their political goals it's right and proper. 

This is so fundamental that they're not capable of true hypocritical thinking because their so backwards that they can't line the two hypocritical thoughts up. 

George Orwell called it ""Double Think"" and it's legit terrifying."
0,Buttery mails! SMH. I hate the GOP
0,"And let's not forget that he had no business being there--apparently it was some kind of favor to Putin, and he sent mercenary soldiers, not Marines, who then left behind the soldiers, including one who was still alive, but then ambushed and mutilated (that's the one whose mother he said ""he knew what he was getting into"" to).   He caused their deaths.   

The even worse hypocrisy was their absolute radio silence on this--Trump literally CAUSING the needless deaths of four American soldiers--after years and years and years of screaming about Benghazi (which was an attack on the US Embassy in a known hotspot, the same as other attacks during the Bush and Reagan presidencies--AND Hillary had requested add'l security, and the GOP had refused it)."
0,"And four Nigerien troops were killed too. 

Also, a typical Trumpian ""Blame Obama"" attack: 

>On 17 October, during a press conference, Trump was asked about his silence by a reporter and commented on the incident. Trump responded by saying that he wrote letters to the families of the victims, and accused his predecessors, specifically President Obama, of not or rarely calling the families of deceased soldiers."
0,The GOP does this because they get away with it every time.
0,"He also got a SEAL killed in his first military action. Crickets.

Edit: and this was *just* off of the Benghazi series of investigations that republicans found nothing actionable with, even after 11 hours of sworn testimony.  Imagine Trump in the same situation."
0,"Well, see, in Trump-world the only deaths that count are not under Republican watch.  The rest of the deaths are jack shit."
2,Never forget who Trump and Republicans really are
0,Well got damit we got a real president now LA David Johnson
2,And both parties are the same?
2,"It was on their way back to the home base when they stopped for water at the village of Tongo Tongo, about 120 miles north of Niger’s capital. There, the group was ambushed by Islamic State-linked militants armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and small firearms."
0,Don't  forget these soldiers were just losers and suckers according to trump
0,"Don't sign up for the military if you don't want to die. My GF's entire family is republican and they asked my opinion about all these deaths happening with the withdrawal from Afghanistan. 

Why do they all of a sudden care about these deaths when we spent 20 years either being killed or killing people?

Fucking blows my mind the stupid shit these people say."
2,"How many lives did we save by leaving Afghanistan? 
Those 15 that died were heroes and they saved potentially 10’s of thousands of lives. 
This is why we should be talking about. This should be the headlines. 

Instead the rhetoric from the extreme left and right are ruining our country. There’s a better perspective out there we just have to try a little harder to empathize with our fellow men. We have to become obsessed with making that happen instead of giving in time the easiness of fighting eAchother."
2,"You have the white house, the house and most of the senate, why would you spread 4 year old nonesense. You need to be saying what your doung to imorove the current situation on like 10 different fronts. Stay current or get out voted. Take some responsibility for once. No one cares aboutbthe finger pointing"
1,These solders didn't die because of an absolute shit show of decision making by the president. Soldiers die in war. period. However what happend in Kabul was entirely preventable and a direct result of Bidens botched withdrawal oppertation.
0,"Remember when we just blew off the Kurds, our allies, leaving them to fend against both Assad and the Turks?  But we are incensed at Biden leaving the the Afghans in Afghanistan after getting over 100,000 of them out?"
0,Any time they say they ‘support the troops’ this as well as their hostility towards the VA and veterans homelessness and mental health should be brought up immediately.
0,"To be fair, allowing Trump to pronounce Niger would be a very dangerous request."
0,"Well, they don't necessarily care about Afghanistan either. It's just a political opportunity to blame President Biden."
2,Funny how obsessed with Trump you guys still are lmao
0,Using the deaths of soldiers for political gain is an incredibly low thing to do. Do not sink to the Republicans level.
1,Are you saying it was ok for joe the unicorn to kill 13 service members?
2,"As a vet, I CAN tell you that vets are props for the powerful."
2,I remember. The widow was the woman in Florida who got a phone call from Trump.
0,This was on the news.  The only places where it was censored was on right-wing fake news propaganda.
2,"I mean ... neither the dems or republicans want attention to *what* those soldiers were doing in Africa, who they were killing, or which oil company was paying for it."
2,"Mhmm. Absolutely zero ability to self reflect at all and think ‘hey maybe the way I’m going about this is wrong or hypocritical?’

Like the way they think Muslims and other religions are so *obviously* wrong but can’t apply those same critical thinking skills to their own religion. Like if a Muslim believed just as fervently as a Christian did, don’t you believe they think their religion is the one true one just like they do?"
2,This literally sums up the trump presidency
2,">On 17 October, during a press conference, Trump was asked about his silence by a reporter and commented on the incident. Trump responded by saying that he wrote letters to the families of the victims, and accused his predecessors, specifically President Obama, of not or rarely calling the families of deceased soldiers."
0,No. Democrats criticize Biden. They aren't trying to ignore anything just because Trump was worse.
2,Good call. I try to pay attention to whataboutism but sometimes it's easy to miss.
2,How many republicans have attended trump rally’s after the election he lost.?
0,Trump couldn't remember her husband's name.
1,Not sure how it minimizes Biden’s failures in any way
2,"He wasn't the center of attention, how is a mentally deranged narcissist supposed to react?"
0,"I always shudder with amazement how any veteran could ever support Trump over Biden in any way. The difference between the two on Veteran's issue is about as far apart as one could get:

2,"Same.

Glad I served under a Commander in Chief that I respected."
0,"Okay... but we've been pointing out literally this meme over and over again since like, 2004 at least. 

""No way they could make John Kerry look like a pussy, he was a highly decorated combat veteran while GW was getting high in Texas"" 

""They've said all this stuff about Obama being a Kenyan Muslim who eats dogs, but they'll HAVE to change their tune now that bin Laden is dead""

""No way that Republicans in Kentucky would pick swamp thing Mitch McConnell over a distinguished Air Force pilot with all the funding in the world""

It's like dude, you don't get it... these people could not give less of a shit about ""the troops"" or ""the flag"" and they certainly don't care about being caught up in some technical hypocrisy. They like cruelty, they like the war. They love that violence is being done to people who they dislike, that's all. It's a really simple, yet totally terrifying."
0,"I don’t know what this means. For 4 years we demanded trump stop talking about all the things he said Hillary did wrong - now Biden wins and we’re talking about all the things trump did wrong. 

I know it doesn’t go over well in the Reddit hive mind but Biden won. Trumps out. We need to stop talking about him and hold our current politicians accountable for the good and the bad."
0,"Not sure how  trump blaming Hillary, who was never president, has anything to do with democrats calling out republican hypocrisy. Granted I don't follow Biden’s press conferences very closely but I can't seem to recall him trump or Pence by name very often at all."
0,"The problem with your position is that it ignores that Trump did everything he could to sabotage Biden. And his appointees have been slowed down. You are aware that Ted Cruz has prevented Biden's State Dept appointees from being confirmed, right?"
0,"This post is focused on the hypocrisy of republicans not the fact that both during Trump and Bidens administration US soldiers died.

Calling everything that calls out hypocrisy ""whataboutism"" is dishonest at best and malicious at worst."
0,"It still occasionally blows my mind, everything else about him aside, that the media acted like it was a big deal that at George Bush's funeral, Trump didn't make it about himself. They acted like it was a big deal that *the president* behaves with the decorum I'd expect from a healthy 5 year old."
1,"I’m talking about this post - per my prior comments. 

Why are we pulling up how trump behaved? He’s out. Biden’s in. Saying “reminder - this is his trump behaved” comes across as saying “well it’s ok Biden screwed this up because what about trump!” 

I’m fine being in the minority on this opinion I just wish the left would stop being so hypocritical."
0,"Come on. It is honestly, literally, “what about what Trump did, it was way worse” at least be big enough to admit it. I am And I was saying in 2015, “what the fuck, Trumpty Dumpty is a freakin sociopath, NO! “"
2,"I think you're misinterpreting the ""it's fine Biden screwed up"" aspect, I don't get the impression he's being let off the hook. I can't blame anyone for continuing to highlight the previous administration's shortcomings in comparable situations to what the current one is being held brutally accountable for."
2,"You can interpret it that way if you want but I don't understand it that way. The title calls out the Republican hypocrisy for blasting Biden now while being fine with Trump back in 2017.

By that standard calling out the different reactions to similar situations aka hypocrisy is from now on always ""whataboutism"" and we will no longer be able to call out hypocrisy at all.

Also what is blasted here is neither the situation leading up to the events nor the failures that led to them but rather the reaction to them."
2,"dude isn't this post and entire context just Dems doing the same, i.e blasting trump back in 2017 and being fine with Biden now? You can change the text to ""Your reminder that when four American soldiers were killed in niger in 2017 Dems raised hell"" and title to ""Dems hypocrisy"" and post it on one of the conservative subs and it'll fit right in.

I've experienced political shithousry in other countries but it's on another level in the US, ~~politicians~~ actually more the supporters, of both sides do the same thing when their guy is not in power. They also do the same thing when your guy is in power. When trump was in t_d was all about obama and drone strikes and now all the dem subs are *but trump did worse*."
1,"So what exactly would you call a “whataboutism” then? It is bringing up a perceived misdeed, of the past, from the opposition, to deflect from the criticism of a current situation. Exactly what this is. Just like when the Trump supporters would bring up Clinton or Obama to avoid addressing things Trump did. (Sure he might’ve said “grab ‘em by the pussy” but that was just locker room talk. Clinton actually sexually harassed his underlings) Doesn’t that sound familiar?"
0,"Dunno in which reality you live but while there are certainly die hard democrats who see no fault in what Biden does the amount of worship Trump gets from republicans is on a whole different level.

There is literally a hearing about the Afghanistan withdrawal initiated by democrats about the Afghanistan withdrawal.

Trump instigated a mob to storm the capitol and got much less heat from republicans than Biden now gets from democrats.

 just as an example.

So no. It is not even close on both sides and thinking that both sides do the exact same thing is again either misinformed or just plain dishonest."
0,"Right. I am a lifelong Democrat but I am not so eat up with partisan bullshit that I deny the obvious. When we do it we are pointing out hypocrisy, when they do it they are deflecting. Ok, live the delusion."
2,"It is exactly as you describe it. Whataboutism is bringing up something that you think was worse to make another mistake seem less bad.

I only disagree that this is the intention of this post. The intention is as I read it to make people remember how different republicans REACTED to the things Trump did wrong compared to how they react to Bidens mistakes now.

The huge difference to me is that the title attacks republicans for their hypocrisy and does not focus on whether Trump or Bidens mistakes were worse."
2,"I was never questioning the validity of the complaint, one way or the other. I was simply pointing out that it is the same tactic. Don’t you understand that the right also believe they are pointing out the hypocrisy of the left when they do it?"
0,Well duh … that’s why they’re gerrymandering districts and making it difficult for dems to vote.  American democracy at work.
0,"We’re still in a battle for the soul. If America chooses not to vote blue in 2024 we’ve lost the battle. After all this bullshit it’s just amazing people can’t find away to vote. The US wouldn’t be the first country to slide into fascism. That said, a good sign will be if Newsom wins the recall by a large margin. But look a CA 48th district, after all the crap Democrats don’t show up to vote."
0,I'm going to say something controversial:  Fani Willis does not think she can find 12 people that would convict Donald Trump.  She knows that there would be jury nullification.  I mean they have Trump on the phone clearly interfering with the Georgia election.  It doesn't matter.  Trump would have enough supporters that would vote not guilty even if they saw him shoot someone on fifth avenue.

0,"It's unlikely to go anywhere unless Tucker starts just using full-on racial epithets.

Most of the mainstream rightwing stuff is careful enough to keep things duplicitous enough for plausible deniability. ""We weren't calling *Mexicans* criminals, we were calling *immigrants* criminals!"" If something is *unambiguously* racist or hate speech, then yeah go ahead and report."
2,"I don’t want YouTube to censor anything but those shouldn’t them up on my searches or recommendation unless I use “Fox News” in the search box. YouTube promotes hate videos on my search that’s my problem, for PR they block bunch of videos but they allow most videos to appear on your searches. Tech companies has to fix the algorithm but they are scared it will affect the user activity on their app."
2,"I’ve just stopped looking at YouTube’s news channels. The comments, no matter who’s in office, are full of whining babies I couldn’t care less about. They need to find something better to do rather than being pathetic losers who talk to the 10,000 other losers also trying to ‘make an impact?’ about the political situation. I too watch Fox News for comedy. ~~F~~Tucker once started saying we should all identify as the opposite gender to break records and that shit was hilarious."

2,What exactly does Reich mean when he says Democrats need to wake up? Is he implying that there's reticence towards change and crushing these freaks? Reich is great but I expect a little more than just foot stomping and demanding the magic wand that doesn't exist. The only Democrats need to wake up about is freaking VOTING. The end.
2,They are making it legitimate by filing lawsuits. People follow news but never the actual hearings. US should have spent more on education and critical thinking programs in schools.
0,"Frankly, if Democrats don’t show up to vote the country will slide into fascism. Look at Texas, Georgia and Florida. That restaurant in Florida that doesn’t allow Biden voters as patrons should clue people in. You just can’t expect to not vote and have things fall in your lap."

Griffith is in the Sedition Caucus and hasn't called for any accountability for any of Trump's actions. He hasn't supported any efforts to hold people accountable for He votes lockstep with his fellow Republicans no matter what is best for his constituents or the country. 

Republicans are trying to keep the focus on the feigned outrage over Afghanistan."

2,"

Click on ""Download the Party Platform"" and take a look at ours.

You have to be careful; your state group wants to kind of oversee what literature is put out. Simply because the Dem messaging should be consistent and fact-based. 

Are you working with your county party? Your County Chair should know what to do. Or your Congressional District Chair."
2,"Yes, that's exactly what you want to do. Facts and information about what Dems are doing and want to do.. not all negativity about Rs. 

What state are you in? You should be able to look at your state party platform. See what your party is doing at the state level and integrate that with info relative to your community."
2,Yes I reached out to my county parties chair to ensure we are getting something out. She agreed with my assessment and hadn’t realized how short we were on any kind of resource for the tables.
2,To be honest I started working not even considering the state or county Dem party could have different So thanks for that idea.
0,No walls... The idea of a border wall is so stupid. Regardless of where you put it. Oregonians  talk about one on our southern border all the time. Lol the Cali's would just come through Nevada. A boycott would be a cheaper solution.
0,Pretty crappy solution for all the Texas Democrats like me that are trying to change things
2,No.  This reminds me too much of my conservative friends talking about doing the same for California or New York.
0,There are some good people in Texas. We can't leave them behind or the Texiban will destroy them.
0,"Better yet:

Let the entire south secede. No war, no guns, no violence. Just paperwork. 

The thing is, no federal money either. 

Let’s see if the Texas economy is enough to subsidize all those red states without federal supplements.

Hell, they can keep most of the flyover states as well. 

Let’s just make it the Northeast, the West Coast, and everyone else is all on their own…"
2,So does that mean men do have a voice when it comes to abortion now? Or does that not compute?
1,Then shouldn’t us men get a seat at the table for the abortion discussion now?
1,If you can program A Generation of children to believe this kind of bullshit you can easily convince them that America is systematically racist and the vaccinated can be infected by people that aren’t sick.

2,even the devil realises human society is fucked
1,"My god. What is happening with Gen Z? Can't we returning to the old years where there were Girls and Boys, Women and Men?"
1,"Then men have a say in abortion? Is that the new official ""liberal"" stance?"
1,So it's alright to murder a baby because some people with body dismorphia have babies? WTF is wrong with these people?
1,"If you have two X chromosomes, you’re a female. Last I checked, only humans with two X chromosomes could get pregnant. Doesn’t matter what you identify as or what your birth cert says. Science in this case is fact and if you are pregnant or have gotten pregnant, you are female"
1,"Let me check if a man ever had a baby. 

Nope. Never. 

You know why? Men do not physically have a vagina. 

That’s a scientific fact. But reality doesn’t mean anything to the far-left. If they “feel” it, it’s a “fact.”  

The clowns have taken over."
2,"Wait so it's no longer a women's issue because women don't exist. Meaning men CAN have a valid opinion on abortions. Suggesting otherwise suggests that trans men aren't real men.

It is transphobic to say men can't have an opinion on abortions."
1,"And we wonder why mental illness is more prevalent on the left?

It's because from the moment they're born, they are fed nothing but alternate reality, anti-science propaganda. 

How in the blue hell can you not end up messed up if you believe the world is X, only to grow up and discover that 98% of the world is Y and you're part of the 2% that believe otherwise."
2,I have no compassion for the ignorant.
1,"Well let's see, to leftists, wrong is right, bad is good, down is up, and losing is winning."
1,"Because these dummies think a girl can transform into a dude so when she gets pregnant they think men can have babies...

Reading that logic is like trying to follow a psychopath's mind... unpleasant"
1,"hang on , seriously... I think she might be mentally ill ?what she's saying is beyond lefty nonsense its actually genuinely deranged , even the most ardent of Trans ""female"" activists don't think they can get pregnant ?! you sure shes not a troll?"
2,"she should be banned from social media for stupidity, she doesn't even know what fact means"
2,Jen Psaki begs to differ.  She stated clearly that only women could get pregnant and make hard choices re. abortion.
1,"This is the same kind of person that says men can't make laws about women's bodies. Yet, according to her logic, men can get pregnant? Hmmm."
1,Lol Females are defined as having eggs and getting pregnant under the concept of mammals. You can do some sort of procedure to put eggs in men; but that is obviously not  a man anymore it's a cyborg.
2,Idiocracy was not supposed to be a documentary.
2,I didn't know her post meant every single leftist thinks this way. Hmm. 🤔 what an educated reddit post title.
1,"Anyone else feel like this whole gender thing is a bit of an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" type situation?"
1,Dang the libs need to go to a mental asylum
2,y'all Americans lmao
1,"Leftism is a truly disease, and a with a quick visit to the Front page of Reddit you can clearly see how badly it devastates brain function."
1,"I'm honestly not sure if they are humans anymore. Wondering if the report and the vaccines have anything to do with one another. Seems more likely Liberals are actually just aliens, body snatchers. The vaccine is the delivery mechanism.  


LOL. Please don't think I'm serious.  


But that's what it feels like."
1,I forgot which ivy league school did a study and found that 64% of those that consider themselves liberals have seen a doctor about mental health issues at least once.
2,What if a female doesn’t identify with the term woman but can still get pregnant?
2,"I'm pretty sure that in the human species ,the female is the only gender that can get pregnant."
2,"Wait, I don't understand. Someone please clarify.

Is she referring to Female -> Male trans people who still have the female sexual organs necessary to give birth? With the incomplete surgery techniques we have today, it is still possible to get pregnant after the surgery. Wouldn't they would fall into their own category instead of being called a traditional woman?

I don't know if that's what she means. Of course on the surface it looks completely ridiculous, but maybe the above is what she's thinking..?"
1,I never knew stupidity was contagious until I met a leftist and realized they are allowed to reproduce !
1,"I genuinely don't understand how a grown man can vote Democrat. I would rather be associated with *Qanon* or even Flat Earters, than with countless legions of people on the Left, take your pick."
2,"That is true, I heard that people who speak English can get pregnant, that is a fact 😂😂"
1,"Been saying it for awhile now, liberalism is a mental disorder."
2,So a man has control of his body a woman control of her body? Good to know!

0,I’m going to demand my job give me paid ma’ pa’ ternity then! 😂
0,"so what are all of your plans for how long you're going to keep pretending to be surprised trans people exist?

fifteen years, twenty-five years? how long you think you can get out of this"
1,I think that person is referring to how people with different sexual identities can become pregnant. The lack of understanding of this could actually be construed as the brain disease.
2,"To Mrs. Gandy’s claim, this is true for male seahorses and perhaps some other species I’m not aware of, but this is not the case for humans.

  My guess is she’s using the scientific definition of gender while we’re using the legal definition which basically a polite way of saying sex."
1,"I'm not sure, because of the username, but I'm getting the sense that this is a troll. but maybe not? I'm not sure. The fact that we can't tell the difference tells you something about the left."
1,"Pretty sure it is a scientific fact--short of being an organism that can reproduce asexually--that only females can get pregnant.  Something about that being the rule for pretty much every species with males and females.  The left is nuts.  Just because you believe something, that doesn't make it fact.  It makes it your opinion.  Opinions are not facts and wishing them so will never make it true.

Being trans is fine if that's how a free individual wants to live.  I literally don't care.  However, it is completely false to claim that men can get pregnant.  It is their opinion that men can get pregnant because it is their opinion that men aren't defined by measurable biological sex characteristics.  Men cannot get pregnant.  Women who want to be men can."
1,"Ok I'll bite. 

Please tell me where the logic falls down.

If a women transitions to being a man, yet still had a uterus, then they can get pregnant and therefore an abortion.

I'm not trying to argue. Genuinely can't see what the point of disagreement is."
1,"I get the sneaking sense that that's actually the point of the post, and it's actually not a leftist post, but rather someone trolling the left. The fact that we can't even tell the difference shows how ridiculous the left has become."
1,"They are called birthing people now. Remember.
The word mother was not inclusive enough.
It also sickens me how so many people are so for infant murder."
2,Nope. Just the ones who will be getting the abortion. Full stop.
1,Brain damage from those vegan diets and getting vaccinated every two weeks for a virus that cannot be immunized. Pretty sure that's why they also want to be forced into totalitarian rule. Severe brain damage and extreme dependence on the teet of big government.
1,"Depends on your opinion.  We only believe in diversity of genitalia and race, not thought."
1,"Well... I'm with you but how about this?......   
  For the folks that say a woman can have an abortion if they want and a man has no say so, then the man should be able to decide whether he wants to pay child support or not!"
2,I think it's always been batshit. But so many people have access to the internet now. And stupidity breeds stupidity
1,"Imagine someone saying this just 10 years ago. I guarantee 99% of Democrats would think that this is fucking crazy. 

  
They are just so easily brainwashed."
1,Ever since we started having “fact checkers” which is like the Ministry of Truth in 1984
2,"The opposite of a fact would be a falsehood.


>  A lie is a statement made by one who does not believe it with the intention that someone else shall be led to believe it

Or something close to that at least.  "
1,Seeing people denying this biological fact makes me wish there was an actual way to change your biological sex at will so people will shut up about it.
2,"Well said, with little parenting they are in for a big surprise when they need to bring in income to pay living expenses. No more time to ""protest"" day and night when you have a 9-5 job to attend. my office hires recent college graduates, I have been there over 6 years now, more than ever we are denying candidates after the 1st day working interview. It may be coincidence but so far I see a trend of lazyiness and unwillingness to proactive"
2,She's referring to trans men who haven't got bottom surgery
1,"> The funny thing is that they are right. Transmascs and non-binary people with female genetalia can get pregnant. But watch how quick I get banned, because you don't care about the facts, all you care about is ""FuCk ThE LiBs""

They're not right.  Only women can become pregnant.  Men who pretend they are women are not women and can't become pregnant.  ""Non-binary"" is not a sex.  Humans are male or female.  Females can become pregnant, males cannot."
2,However English speakers born without ovaries can’t get pregnant. Lol
1,"I don’t think trans people don’t exist, I think they living a lie. 

You can’t simply change your gender and go against science and biology simple because your feeble reptilian brain “thinks” so.

I feel like a potato sometimes, doesn’t that mean I can identify as one and force my pronouns on others? No, because one you force others to say something, it’s not about respect and more about manipulation and force.

And back to transgenders, I believe everyone should live their life. If you wanna be XYZ behind closed doors go do so. But don’t make it my problem, and force yours views on me. I think everyone should love themself for who they are. 

Don’t even get me started on forcing kids to choose a gender. It’s stupid and pointless. If a child wants to do something, let them do it, unless it could permanently harm them or hurt them, like hormones. And let’s all agree that a 3 year old might not be able to count their fingers twice and get the same number, let alone choose what they want to be in life. If you were to ask a 3 year old what they wants to be when they grow up, they might say Spider-Man FFS."
2,I'm not surprised they exist. I'm surprised they're allowed out of the asylum.
2,"I'm guessin the whole transitioning part? I align with you but I understand the conservatism on this.

One has to understand that LGBTQ community is a part of world's culture not just America. It's a global community. One that can't be done away with."
2,"I had someone I work with comment on Facebook the exact sentiment of the op, unironically. Some really do think this."
1,I mean yeah.. The left is ridiculous... But the right is taking horse dewormer for a virus that doesn't exist....
1,So why do Cali libs care about Texas abortion laws then? 🤔
1,"I always see liberal media say ""What is the Republican Party's obsession with blue hair?"" and play dumb in the article, as if there couldn't be a more obvious indicator of political beliefs by the cookie cutter look that has evolved. It's funny. I have nothing against blue hair, I just think it's funny that obvious signaling is presented as a united front for those that support the politics behind it, and act like it's surprising that other people notice it."
2,"Back in my day, crazy hair and clothes were our way of rebelling against government and authority. Just like everything they steal it. Now to rebel I have to look normal. The future is stupid."
2,Like Trump's?
1,I’m pointing out the obvious hypocrisy of the left saying men can’t weigh in on abortion debate but also men can get pregnant.
2,Exactly. Before most people would just tell them to shut the fuck up. But now they find each other online and continue the echo chamber
1,XXY is sterile so don’t have to worry about abortions
1,"the term trans men its purely  a term I use to be polite , they are not men and never will be men  ..science"
1,"A person who identifies as male but was born with female parts can get pregnant, fact."
2,Because its a societal issue... Not a state issue.
1,"Hm? I didn’t say that at all. I said if a man is pregnant, then that man should have the right to decide what to do with his own body."
1,"Oh I know, I'm agreeing and just saying they don't care about the hypocrisy at all. 
 They only care to hear the opinions of those who fall in line with their insanity, while hypocritically claiming they care about diversity."
1,"They can identify as whatever they want, but this hypothetical person is still a female. An XX biological female human being. Female is a biological term. Whatever is going on inside their head doesn't change their biological sex."
2,"What lie? 

The left IS ridiculous.

The right IS taking horse dewormer."
1,But men can't call it a societal issue because.......? (Insert elitist liberal hypocritical nonsense here)
1,A man can't get pregnant.  I think you mean a woman who identifies as a man.
2,she lives in a fantasy world where her weird world view is universal and uses language like things  have  already been decided in her favor even  though the  vast majority don't agree with her at all
2,There are actually very experimental surgeries on uterus transplants for Trans going M to F but I doubt they mean that since you wouldn't need a abortion if you are actually trying to get pregnant with a huge rare experimental surgery unless something went wrong.
2,"The virus does exist.

Ivermectin is not horse dewormer."
2,The medicine that won't a Nobel Prize in 2015 for its effects on humans? Gtfoh you dipshit. Google shit before you embarrass yourself anymore.
0,Because no one should control another persons body - there was a war about this or something
2,No I mean a man who was assigned female at birth but is a man. But there can of course also be an intersex or nonbinary person who has a uterus.
2,"The first sentence is just blatantly false. Without surgery that is just not the case, except in a super small percentage of genetic mutation cases. Almost universally males have XY and females have XX. This observation is also universal in every mammal on earth"
2,"Sarcasm also exists... Its been the stance of conservatives that covid is a fake for a while... I was being sarcastic.

It is also a cattle-dewormer. And works on PARASITES

Covid... Is a virus."
2,"So much wrong. 

Its an anti-parasite. It won said prize for its work vs parasites. 

Covid is a virus. 

Full stop. 

PS. It 'won' a NPP, not 'won't.' But keep telling others not to embarrass themselves."
1,Then explain how the left is still calling this a wAr oN WoMeN
1,Removed and banned for liberal talking points.
1,"I never met or seen a conservative that believed the virus was fake. Not even Trump. 

Also Ivermectin is IN some horse dewormers, it's primary purpose for being is not as a horse dewormer."
0,"Yes. Trump did call it a hoax. (Which is another way of saying fake) 

Its still only effective against parasites... 

Covid is still a virus."
1,"No... I 'got you' on the definition of a virus v a parasite... The rest was to prove you're full on dumb not just half way. 

Dr's, much like states are unfortunately, woefully, pathetically inequal. Its like comparing the basic humanity of Texas vs Cali, its not a proper comparison. 

Those Dr's should lose their jobs."
2,Yet it IS an parasite med being used for a virus... It deserves the agro.
1,What if you're a pregnant woman? Then it's okay? Just trying to understand the liberal nuance of justifying any and all immoral stances in order to personally benefit
2,I mean if you want to deny him the respect of telling you what he means. The media and leftists were the only ones who thought he meant the virus itself wasn't real.

Billions of dollars goes into creating lies and propaganda because it works. This isnt JFK democrat party anymore or the Bush Republican party. Your representation shouldn’t be religious level of faith to a political party."
1,It’s crazy how liberal Reddit is. I think it’s brainwashing voter bots or something it’s like the plague. I’ve considered deleting it because most everyone on here is a Biden dick rider. Nice to see some like minded people on here
1,"Wouldn't ""Dump Joe Biden"" be more accurate?  I mean..I doubt even Jill wants to fuck him."
2,cant believe someone would vote for that douche unreal how dumb people are
1,"Joe Biden is the most professional loser I've ever seen. The guy has gotten away with plagiarism throughout his ""career"", election fraud, having a piece of shit son etc. I doubt Democrats will remain in power after 2022-24 if their house of cards start falling next few years."
2,"Someone named Orange_Star commented on me somehow treading on a groups domain. Sorry to say it this way, but I love my republican brothers and sisters, and I could have once called myself one. Now all I do is watch others be radicalized in an echo chamber of absolute nonsense.

We need the Democratic and Republican Parties to have this country run as intended.

2,Wisconsin state I believe.
1,"The Democrats stole the 2020 election, Biden never won in the first place.  But this might all be a blessing in disguise... the incompetence and radical agenda of the Biden administration is showing the country what the left is really about and hopefully that will result in a landslide victories for republicans in 2022."
1,"Sorry.  We were too busy at work.  Checking in at lunch here.  This is pathetic and idiotic.  Biden is a terrible President and I desperately hope the we can put up a candidate who can defeat him in 24, but this accomplishes nothing more than making Republicans look like a moronic fan club to anyone in the middle."
1,Nah. This is who we are. Fuck Joe Biden.
2,"Attacking governments is kinda what Patriots do, hate to break it to you."
1,"You're not entirely wrong, but it must be remembered that Democrats collectively and repeatedly vote to put the radical left in charge.

If you hand the radicals the keys to the bus, and keep giving them gas money, knowing they are radicals, you don't get to claim it isn't your responsibility when the bus goes off a cliff."
2,It just seems like you have no real Argument or point to make against us although you're still angry and so you're just insulting us based on no logic or proof behind your claim. What's irredeemably sad is the fact that you have no leg to stand on and so you're clinging to insults you would hear a 9 year old saying instead of admitting that you're wrong
1,"I share this opinion too. Biden never truly won, I watched it happen on election night and the days after. Although because he's in office now it seems like its given Democrats a taste of what they actually voted for."

2,"Not all of them, a lot of them yes but even some Republicans listen to the left"
1,Latest polls show it would still be a close election. That’s how much the left hates Trump. They would rather vote for the second worst possible person for the job that ran as a democrat.

We were given the paper ballots and told to fill in our choices with black sharpies, then slide the ballot into this machine that supposedly read the ballots.  The problem was, the sharpies were bleeding through the front-and-back ballots leaving numerous ""extra"" sharpie circles.  Several of us demanded new ballots that we would fill in with regular pens but were told NO, we had to do it their way.  There's no way that any ballot reader machine was getting the correct reading on those ballots.  This was in a top critical county that went Trump in 2016 that normally leans slightly left so no surprise they went out of their way to cheat."
2,"I do notice they show the teleprompter when trump is talking, whereas they don’t when Biden is talking."
1,"Auxilary, this Subreddit is for Republicans to discuss issues relating to the Republican Party, you have no right to come into our Domain and try to silence us, not to mention making an uncalled for, personal attack on a Reddit user for their username.

1,"Combination of that, but even moreso the fact that the Dems have morphed into a party that doesn't care about morals, truth, facts, or results..  And are obsessed with handouts, freebies, white racism, and wokeism.  They've successfully managed to delude the younger generation on all this. 

So they're going to get at least 45-50% of the vote no matter who is running."

1,"why is the left so determined to repress  ANY alternative to mainstream treatment for C19 , the only reason that makes sense to me big pharma has massive influence over them"
1,"If this is false I would sue for sure...cnn , fake news as always."
2,Total norm for CNN Fox ought to run a fake story about Lemon and Fredo Cuomo being closet crossdressers and Wolf Blitzer being a Deceptacon.
1,Def sue cnn then we can see what else cnn lies about
2,"It’s the use of the term “horse de-wormer” that is fake. Per Merck’s website, ivermectin is to be used to treat the nematodes of a certain parasite in livestock and humans. Also per their website, “no scientific basis for potential therapeutic effect against covid 19 from pre-clinical studies. No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with covid 19. A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.” Merck is the company that created ivermectin."
1,"Of course they’re willing to lie to push a narrative. This is nothing new. 

Most all “journalists” are far-left activists. They’ll happily push anything, no matter how ridiculous, to ‘prove’ that anybody that doesn’t think like them is an idiot. 

And their phony “fact-checkers” friends will gladly back them up."
1,Sue for sure. It is defamation of character. It would be an easy win. Then donate winnings to Project Veritas. Nick Sandmann won. CNN needs to be prosecuted.
2,"I guess that I am by definition a RINO given that I do vote Republican but only because they represent more of my positions than Democrats.  I'm pretty centrist politically speaking.  So, please pardon me if I'm not one of the folks this sub is supposed to be for.  But I just feel it necessary to point out how intellectually bizarre the rhetoric against Ivermectin is.

Now, I'm not an anti-vax guy.  I've had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine and have no problem getting a booster if it's necessary.  I was also one of the first people in my state to get COVID in March of last year.  But I respect everybody's choice about what to do with their own bodies.  I'm not taking a position against anyone's rights or decisions.  The point I'm making is solely to reveal what I believe to be an intellectual weakness in the anti-Ivermectin crowd's arguments.

The anti-Ivermectin crowd rails against it because it's ""not meant for humans"" and other similar arguments.  However, Ivermectin is FDA-approved for human use.  And do you know what is **not** FDA-approved?  **The vaccine.**  

So, here you have these people insulting your intelligence over the fact that some folks are taking a drug originally not meant for humans but that eventually became FDA-approved for human use and recognized as having legitimate, beneficial uses in humans.  But those same people are out there pushing crazy ideas like vaccine mandates and prison time if you don't get a substance shot into your arm that is **not** FDA-approved.  

I'm not usually one to just lay into somebody and call them dumb, but in this case, I think it's safe to say that many of these anti-Ivermectin people are, in fact, dumb.  At the very least, they fail to see the intellectual inconsistencies in their positions.  One can only assume that if those same people were diagnosed with a blood clotting disorder that they would refuse to allow a doctor to prescribe them Warfarin.  You know, since Warfarin is rat poison."
2,You may want to check Merck’s website in regards to ivermectin in regards to covid. They are the company that created ivermectin.
1,"At this point we might as well be a monarchy where the is a figure head. Our country is ran as a buisness. Import, import, import, spend, spend, spend. Money runs this country as do the corporations. Politicians are men and women trained in manipulation and word play through their education. They gain power, maybe for selfish or selfless reasoning but it always ends up with them stuffing their pockets. 

How else you think things dimwitted democrats have such money? Pelosi is worth over $100m. She didn't get that by GIVING like they all say they want us to do. Big pharma and many, many other corporations pay them off. They talk about being Sweden or Switzerland but that'll never happen when you run a poorly managed buisness where more money leaves what its ment for to go to pockets of assholery. 

Sorry for the rant. Been alittle wound up recently."
2,It is 100% idk msm is claiming people are doing this. A hospital had to come out and deny that a doctor said they could not accept gunshot patients sue to beds being full of people who died in this.
2,"The Pfizer vaccine is FDA approved though, at least for ages 16+"
2,"You almost had it then lost it in the second paragraph.  Corruption runs deep in congress. Not a left side or right side. NRA, oil and fuel companies funds GOP .  Green energy  pharm funds the left. Problem is no term limits. Problem is the middle class and lower class working people cant afford to donate $10k to their representatives to keep them in a seat in congress. So what does congress do? Look to the top 1% for funds. In return, bills and laws are passed that are more in line with corporations than in line with we the people. Our donations are petty and not enough for them. 

Our founding fathers warned us of a two party system. Its destroying our country.  Last time this country came together was/2001. There was no hate against race, religion and sex within America against  each other. that didn't matter. Now we cant even come together for a virus thats making millions of people sick making 10s of thousands of people die. My parents were and still is trump supporters but they still took their chance on science  and took the vax.

My opinion. Our country is more in line with Corporatocracy than anything else."
1,"yeah its sad people dont wonder where people like Pelosi life long grifters worthless insects , that have done ZERO worth mentioning , get so much money from ,"
1,"The rest aren't, though, which is the whole point.  The whole ""get the vaccine"" crowd have pushed any vaccine you can get your hands on.  And they've been doing it since well before the Pfizer vaccine was approved, so the fact that it is approved now doesn't give them a leg to stand on.  They still pushed experimental substances that were not FDA-approved to be forced on people while using disgusting rhetoric against people who tried other experimental treatments.  It was always an intellectually dishonest position."

2,"I honestly don't think it is going to have much of an impact. I deal with hiring in Florida where the extra benefits were gone over 2 months ago, and it has only gotten more scarce. Way more scarce if I am honest.

I would assume it extends variably to the rest of the country, but only speaking for my area, the major problem seems to be key industries not recovering fully hold back others. The biggest one I hear from prospects  is childcare. Many childcare facilities that existed pre-covid don't exist now. And the ones that do charge significantly more than they did before, because supply is low and demand is high, so they can easily. Everyone knows childcare is expensive, but when it goes up 30 or 50 or 100% or more over a year, many of the people who were working just dont make sense anymore unless they get a raise or a different job, and thats IF you can find one that can and will take your money. Theres waiting lists everywhere for childcare.

There's been a return somewhat to having a stay at home mom or dad in many families because working where they worked before is now negative money. Our economy has been used to having more adults in the labor force, as opposed to a single household earner. A return to that in any significant percentage easily continues the trend we are in now. Low supply and crazy demand."
2,I see the economic collapse is still coming together right on schedule.

1,Unemployment shouldn't be a way of living. Nobody should be on unemployment for more than a month or so.
2,"Speaking as someone who was laid off because of COVID last year and who was using the extra benefits, it's about time. After I got laid off, I qualified for a state program that I used to go back to school 100% paid for, and have about a year left until I graduate. Trying to find work in the IT field with no experience is tough though."
2,I just wanna know what all these fucking Marines are gonna do to keep busy...
2,Most people in the states with low cost of living will just collect regular unemployment since they probably have a pretty nice savings. Imo I don’t think the labor market will return to pre covid levels until next year.

1,"This is not the time to spike the football.  Unemployment benefits are a smokescreen wedge issue that Democrats are going to use to climb back over the ledge that Afghanistan, COVID and the economy pushed them off.  The campaign ads write themselves: ""Republicans want people off benefits so they can go back to the jobs that are in demand: servile, demeaning unskilled labor that keep people in a cycle of poverty for generations.""  Instead of letting the clock run out, maybe conservatives should have come together to push policy that expanded the middle class.  That way, when Democrats did block it (because it has Republican names on it), they would have to eat more shit at the ballot box.  Instead, our guys handed them a W, it's fucking retarded."

At first, yes, of course, these benefits were needed and wholesomely welcomed. But then the prolonged shutdowns  and stay at home orders created this golem in humans; which was lazy, un-dedicated and slothful. Maybe some of these people already had this golem in them and these benefits just fed into it more. Maybe some of these people were hard workers and developed this golem because of the hardy benefits. Whatever this case, the government should be held accountable for this, but they won’t."

But what about the single moms with a bad ex. No family in the area or they have jobs to go to. So they can’t watch the children. She is soul provider and she was an essential work. Kids couldn’t go daycare because it was closed. But she has to pay the bills?  Daycare closes and the other places are either full or can’t expand. So mom starts staying at home.

Someone has to work to build that house you’re living in. Someone has to work to hunt and gather that food you are eating. Someone has to work to research, create, manufacture, assemble, and deliver that iPhone to you. Someone has to work to keep the cell towers and satellites operating so you can continue to browse Instagram and tik tok. Someone has to work to provide you your avocado toast.

> People are tired of the working conditions and expectations that have developed, and have finally discovered their worth as employees, 

Financially you are only worth what someone else is willing to pay you. You don’t get to determine your own financial worth. Otherwise, I’d determine my financial worth to be $10 Unfortunately, I don’t have any skills that are worth $10 therefore no one values my financial worth at $10  

> People want to be able to survive and be happy without having to kill themselves working 70 hours a week. 

Then get a new job. If working 70 hrs a week is not paying for your needs, you either need to reduce your expenses or get a higher paying job. A few years ago I was making I didn’t like making that little money. I decided I wanted to make more money. I went on google and looked up high paying jobs. I found one area  that was high paying that I was relatively interested in, and I googled what qualifications I needed to get one of those jobs. For this specific job, it was a specific college degree. Now it doesn’t have to be a college degree, for some high paying jobs it could be trade school, a software coding boot camp, a certification program, etc. But for this specific job, it was a specific college degree. I then decided to go to school to get this degree. It sucked, and between school and my job I was putting in 70-90 depending on the week. I had no life whatsoever for 4 years, and like I said, it sucked. But it was totally worth it. I now work in the industry that I had originally researched. 

If you aren’t satisfied with the pay for your current job, you need to get a higher paying job. In order to get a higher paying job, you need to acquire a skillset that people will be willing to pay you money for. Like I said above, this doesn’t have to be school, as school can be expensive. However, there are plenty of affordable ways to attend school, and I am perfectly happy to share these with you (or anyone else) if you care, and I would love to help. Regardless, trade schools and certification programs can also be great ways to increase your skillset. 

> Even people working 40 expect to make a reasonable wage and be valued as employees. 

Tbh 40 hrs a week really isn’t that much. At 8 hrs a day, 5 days a week, that’s literally of the day you don’t have to work, and you still have the weekend on top of that

> People want to be able to retire comfortably without having a $100k salary their whole life. People want to work to live, not live to work. 

You don’t need anywhere close to a salary for your whole life in order to retire comfortably. You can retire comfortably on far less (I guess it depends on what your definition of comfortable is). Again, if you (or anyone else) wants more information on how to do this, please let me know, or visit It’s really not difficult at all, and I’d love to help where I can. 

> The Right has had a significant problem with understanding the meaning of phrases built out of 2-3 words.

Okay"
2,"Thanks for the reading suggestion.
I, too, have been skeptical about the financing method of UBI, and it's a semi absurd concept for me. Europe already has quite extensive basic income systems, but they are bound to conditions. A few countries have UBI test phases from time to time.
I think it's an interesting concept and am interested to see how it will work out.

I can somewhat relate to many if these topics, because i changed workplaces during lockdown for a job that sounded less prestigious on paper, but pay was significantly better, more time off, more benefits, less micromanagement, less pressure ""from above"". And that functions quite as well.
I understand you can't have all the benefits in every job, and sometimes you'll need minimum wage to mop up the floor or something, but everyone need to finde their niche where they can lead a fulfilling life."

1,">The basis behind anti work is just providing the bare minimum shelter, food, healthcare to everyone so they're not 'forced' to work.

Everything essential for living could be provided to an individual but work would still absolutely be required. In fact it would no longer be optional at all. when services are provided for free what incentive is there to do it? I don't know how many people would work in a warehouse for free and the same goes for teachers, doctors, surgeons. These are absolutely essential positions that now need to be assigned rather than staffed voluntarily. You can't just not pay these people.

You can advocate for a higher wages thats fine, but removing or severely reducing salary *(Which would absolutely be necessary in a gov. controlled scenario)* has dire consequences. This is why the USSR had so many problems. Magnitogorsk is a prime example. So many people died in that industrial hell hole due to the sever lack of any real experience since they just assigned random people to work in the mines & foundries. I mean imagine being told to work as an ER tech with no option to leave or find another job else where.

In any scenario where a large group of people are permitted to contribute nothing to society. There is other which must suffer greatly to provide it. If you can't see that your either an idiot or don't want to acknowledge it.

What you want is to be rich without putting in the time."

If they get shitty, vote them out. Vote on your pay. Vote on expansion. Vote on recruits. 

We're just asking for democracy. The freedom to vote on things that affect you on a personal level.

This capitalist society we've been living in isn't democratic. The democracy we slapped onto our government system is just a bandaid, or more like a blind, to hide the fact that our real overlords aren't the politicians we vote for, but the  billionaires that buy the politicians that we vote for.

0,"Yeah the desciption of isn’t really doing me any favors, and if you sort by new, then you see the exact thing you mentioned. But (mind I am not actually a member of the sub) I typically see high quality posts exposing or complaining about the abuse of the working class.

Agree with u again, financial worth isn’t decided by you, it’s decided by the people paying you, and companies make less money the more they pay their employees. No one should be working for an unliveable wage, and since minimum wage hasn’t exactly continued to be proportional to the cost of living, many people ARE working for less than their worth. People are realizing they are worth more, and hopefully more and more people will realize in the near future. Maybe you don’t deserve a  $10 million salary, but you certainly deserve more than you make now, as does everyone else on the fucking planet. Your concept of financial worth works, but the people on the other side think everyone is worth pay as little as they can get away with.

Not everyone can just go work 70-90 hours of work or school, and I think the “just get a job” argument is one of the dumbest and most impractical pieces of advice. Not only is the recruiting process hell for everyone, but especially the disadvantaged. Now I’m glad that you were able to go to school and get what you wanted, but there is no reality where a significant amount of people could do that. Do you really imagine people unhappy with their job haven’t considered getting a different one? I apologize but this point of contention is bare bones, shallow, and downright ignorant.

I will say your tbh about 40 hours not being that much absolutely decimated my original statement regarding a 40 hour week. You’re absolutely right, people who only work of the day 5 days a week deserve to be treated like shit by their employers, and since they don’t work weekends, why do they deserve a reasonable wage amiright???"
2,"The problems with UBI as it has been marketed in the US, are twofold: 

1. They are talking about it as a replacement for Welfare - and the current welfare systems are far more lucrative for the recipients.  People will not voluntarily switch.  If forced to switch, they will riot.

2. Even in the amounts advertised, it can't be paid for in the US."

And please do not bring up Moses in a conversation about taxes. If you truly are a child of God, show some humility. Let me remind you of Matthew 25:41.

*'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.*

I'm not really in an argumentative mood at the moment.

Please don't take anything personal. Realize that my comments just reflect my personal frustrations with my life. I was an atheist most of my life but around 2014 I decided I was agnostic. Now I attend church regularly. To me it's really not about ""God"" but the community. Frankly, there's nothing about Jesus I don't like. Trying to be more like Him everyday.

My worst posts are in the evening or early AM. I'm not ashamed to admit sometimes I drink too much and think things are funny when I'm just being an insufferable retard."
2,"I rather they take what's offered than take stuff that doesn't belong to them. So I think we should collectively offer them limited assistance. Like food stamps or housing, but not a blank check, which they're going to buy booze or drugs with(probably). Very against UBI as well!

A lot of homeless just seem mental and desperately in need of help. I'm completely for getting these people off the streets it's fucking depressing and annoying. I don't think they deserve incarceration.

What if we took all the prison money and actually tried to rehabilitate these sad souls? They might just surprise us beyond our wildest expectations."
0,"Do you like gardening?

It's like I said... people would want to work in order to get better things. I don't think most people would be content with just a bed, food, and healthcare.

2,"What films consider hat work today, what they consider being mistreated is an extraordinarily low bar.  I worked on farms as a teen, and summers doing dirty asphalt work in 100+ degree heat come college.  Folks bitching about air conditioned Amazon warehouse jobs that pay in my area to start a “dystopian future”?  

Their definition of being “mistreated” usually means getting to work on time and doing the work as expected.  Then they want machines to do the work, and are surprised when that means less jobs."
2,"> See, exploitation shouldn't be allowed under law.

Generally it isn't.  An objective view of exploitation is a bit different than what you seem to think it is.

2,"The values of the house probably not by much if they do. But there will be a lot more houses on the market with foreclosures and people moving as they get new jobs or lose current ones. In 2020 no one could really move and start new jobs except for small number of cases. 2021 we see people start trying to get back to normal and we have shortages left and right which causes a supply and demand effect making my home 40% more valuable than it was the previous year. As more homes are on the market the supply goes up to meet the demand again so we could see a 5%-10% drop in value. 

Im not a financial expert by any means tho. Just some idiot on Reddit."
2,Probably gonna stabilize but a lot of foreclosures now that they can evict
2,"You gave me a tough job today, man. I like you.

While I appreciate your admission here (truly I do), we cannot allow your behavior here. If you truly want to engage us, do so without venting at us. We are not your enemy and your ideas might indeed be wrong, but you won't find out if they are and you won't imporve them if you just treat people like shit.

I do apologize, but I have to ban you. I will make it temporary, but it will be pretty long because you don't seem to be a Republican. Seriously though, I do appreciate that you realize what you are doing and seem somewhat remorseful about it. I seek to be more like Jesus, too. It can be really fucking hard, but it's worth it.

God loves you, man.

I strongly suggest reading the Gospel of John and Acts to see what Jesus teaches. It is so on point with what I am absolutely sure you believe to be moral, that you might even see that he's calling to you. All you have to do after that is ask him into your heart and believe he has been raised.

0,"I don't think that able bodied people of sound mind should be assisted unless they need assistance.  Someone who lost their job last year when most businesses were shutting down needed assistance.

Someone who is out of work because they choose to not work, does not need assistance, they need a swift kick in the rump.

Many of the homeless are not of sound mind.  We need to go back to putting these people in asylums where they can be cared for, rather than leaving them on the street."
1,Look up LBJ’s war on poverty we’ve been trying at it for going on 50 years now but the poverty rate has barely changed so giving people welfare doesn’t seem to be the answer
1,"Yes and we have dumped trillions at this problem and it never gets better. 

So your answer is to poor more money at it.  Government can’t solve this it’s not in their best interest"
1,"That is hopelessly optimistic. And almost immediately debunked by the current labor shortage. You remove the fear of eviction and supplement their income than nobody works. Because social welfare temporarily eclipsed what they could make by actually working. The greater the social welfare received by all the more people will be affected. If given the option most would rather settle than work for additional benefits. 

The real kicker is the less people work the more expensive basic goods would become. Since they need to encourage people to work who otherwise don't need too. The new cost of living would require an increase in social welfare provided creating a cycle until provider just gives up. The only solution here would be to mandate people work or directly assign them which kind of defeats the purpose of your above scenario."
1,Or what the tipping point is for other people to be so angry and disincentivized that they stop working. Which is a separate problem than the straight math of it.
2,Well I live in Alaska and we do have a permanent fund dividend that we get once a year that comes from taxes paid by oil companies but the thing is we only get $1000-$2000 so it’s not enough to live off and plus since Alaska has a small population were able to give it but if you took a bigger state like Michigan where my dad grew up the dividend would only be like $25 a person.
0,"So, anecdotally it's easy to make a company. Perfect. Let me gather my vast funding and do so. 

Nothing is objective about exploitation, my friend. Exploitation happens between at least two people, with one of them believing it's not exploitation. That's very subjective. 

I can tell you that the folks believe that extracting profit from a laborer is exploitation, and that's why they hate working in the current system.

It's not fulfilling to have your boss take upwards of 80% of the money you make for them. I can attest to that. Quite frankly, it's soul crushing. It shouldn't be fulfilling to have a bunch of *people* laboring *for* you. That's some kingpin bullshit. If you want to be king of the castle so badly, go play chess, instead of literally exploiting people for your own personal gain."
0,"Dude you’re not understanding what I’m saying. People who work 40 hours aren’t as valuable as people who work 100, obviously. I am trying to put across that people want to make a few more dollars an hour and not get treated like shit, but you seem to be too proud of throwing years of your life away working in a flawed system to understand that you, along with everyone else except the elite, are getting fucked"
1,"> If i understand you correctly, the problem with 1. seem more of a social issue than economic issue.

No, its economic.  The amount Yang was talking about was $1000 per month, and Yang was talking about getting people off welfare by moving them to UBI.  Very few people can live off $12,000 per year, so they'd still need to have another source of income.  Nobody would voluntarily switch from welfare to UBI - they make far more on welfare - and if forced, they would riot.  So we're talking about UBI *in addition to* welfare.

> And with 2. has it been calculated before?

328 million people times $1000 per month is $4 trillion per year - which just happens to be about the same as our total Federal revenues.  It would leave nothing left to pay for the rest of government.  Even getting rid of welfare would just reduce the amount of programs you can't pay for.

> is it really doomed? Why not give it a try?

It is really doomed.  It has been tried, and the effects were exactly what conservatives warned about.  If the amount was high enough to live on, not only was it even less affordable, people simply stopped working."
2,"Then again, sometimes the banks choose not to foreclose. I know somebody that lost their business around 09 and they just stopped paying their mortgage. The bank did everything in their power to not foreclose. Not because they wanted to be nice, but because the bank would have been under water on the house too. The bank even paid the property tax and didn't evict or foreclose on her for over five years."
2,Just report these trolls and move on.
0,No. No you didn't. 'Trillions' have been spent to keep homeless people out of view. Very little of this money has been spent on actually helping the homeless

0,"The labor shortage is caused by much more than just people not wanting to work. More than half a million people are dead now, and many of those were ""essential"" workers such as cooks and fast food workers, which is where we are mainly seeing the labor shortage. Covid has also made restaurants and other labor providers have shorter hours, reduced dine in capacity, and as a result they are providing less benefits to people. 

If you had to work and still not have enough to eat or have benefits vs not work and still not eat or have benefits, why would you work?"
2,"That's closer to a tax break than UBI, though. In order to be UBI, it would have to be enough to live off of, and as far as I know most pilot projects either give very little or only to a small group of people, which doesn't really study any of the effects we would be interested in seeing in relation to a larger economy and work culture shift."
2,"Agree, unlikely near term - at least a decade a way - lots of work on AI, machine learning, genetic algos, vision recognition, neural processing, etc that might change that - but it's probably going to take at least a decade or two to mainstream at scale

1,"So why do you think he's allowing in twice as many illegals as have ever come in before?  Keep in mind, the border patrol only catches between a third and half of those who come across the border, so we'll get something on the order of 6 million this year.

...and do you think employers who can't get Americans to take their jobs will turn up their noses at illegal aliens who will work for less, when the Federal government will turn a blind eye?"
1,"Not to belittle a tragedy but the people killed by covid make up an extremely small percentage of the population. The US is home to over 328 million people. Total cases over the entire pandemic is only 40 million. The covide death toll is absolutely not responsible for the labor shortage. 

To provide an example where a large event did cause some labor problems look at WW1. The war depopulated entire villages, but even that was due in large part to poor conscription and assignment practices. It saw around 20 million dead spread across Europe and other participating nations.

The black death also caused some labor shortages, but again it killed way more people. Estimated around 25 million.

The problems you cited above are a result of not having enough people to staff the restaurant. They are unable to function at full capacity with only a skeleton crew assuming they even have enough people to open in the first place. The solution is to bump wages, but many small businesses can't afford it without also bumping prices or corporations who just don't want to."
2,"Dude there are over 10 million unfilled positions right now, and a big percentage of Covid deaths were retired."
2,Exactly I would agree it’s closer to a tax break or a tax refund. Because again you can’t live off of it. And plus the money comes from taxes paid by the oil companies because the Alaska constitution says the resources belong to the people so instead of government sending you a 55 gallon barrel of oil they send you some money
2,"I would argue that it’s better to hold real assets (eg house) during an economic crash rather than having the cash. During a crash there will be inflation, so your cash will be worth less, but a house will still have inherent value. Please share your thoughts on this because I’m not sure if this is correct."

2,And they supposably want to hand out another 2k to almost everyone. What good is giving away money if it's worthless because of the inevitable hyper uncrease in inflation.
1,"It's stealing from those of us with savings rather than debt, and those who are retired.  So as usual, punishing success and rewarding failure."
2,"How is this stealing from those with savings and the retired?? Seniors will be taken care of in this bill, and I understand the ultra wealthy will be a tax break.. these are good things right?"
2,"When the government spends this massive an amount of money, they are borrowing or conjuring up money in some way.  Those dollars now compete with our dollars in the market for the same goods.  Supply of money is up, demand for goods is up due to government spending, leading to of the dollars in people's savings and retirement funds.   Those in or near retirement are typically on fixed incomes or invested in less volatile, lower return assets such that they can't keep up with high inflation.  Those in the workforce and earlier in thier investing years are invested in riskier assets who's return is more likely keep up with inflation and in theory their wages rise with inflation (in theory...). In any case, every dollar you have is worth less, and every dollar you have borrowed and spent is also worth less.  Reducing your effective debt if you're in the red, but harming your savings if you are not.

The ultra wealthy primary have money in corporations whos assets and value are pretty well hedged against inflation.  It won't harm them, it'll mostly harm middle to upper-middle class."
1,"So, what is the avenue of change that limits our government from the u.s. dollar? Government spending and tax breaks for the ultra rich seems to be a problem that we have to deal with.  Spending money on needles wars that go to the military industrial complex seems to be a moot point in all this. How can we get rid of special interests stealing from normal folks? Do we not target corporate interests in how they do business in the U.S. and beyond? Shall we make folks like Bezos and Musk pay more taxes to offset this spiral?"
2,"If you took 200 billion from Bezos and just handed it out to all US citizens, it would be about $600 per person, one-time.  It wouldn't change anything drastically.  The scale of government spending is so far beyond the ultra wealthy it's obscene.  My point is the ultra wealthy are not the problem or the solution.  They're an inevitable result of a global economy in my view.  They aren't necessarily evil or good, but one thing that's pretty universal is that they have changed the world on a global scale.

The exception to the above being when special interests and lobbyists are pushing policy not in our best interest with billionaire dollars driving policy.  We used to call that corruption or at least a conflict of interest or ethics violation.

I have no idea how to fix it, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, so hold my beer:

1) Remove the power and money from DC by drastically decreasing federal spending and returning power to the states.  I'm thinking decentralization of this power makes it harder to corrupt and more accountable to the people.

2) Cryptocurrency may be a game changer.  I'm sure with its own set of unforseen consequences.


I don't know what the numbers are currently, but Biden was proposing something like 10 trillion in spending over the coming years.  For my household, of which, I'm the only income earner, if we naively just divide 10 trillion by 330 million citizens, then multiple by the number in my household, that's about 150,000 the government is spending of my earnings, on my behalf.  The reality is worse, because the bottom 50% aren't effectively paying federal income tax (though of course they pay other taxes).  I'm sorry, I have better things to spend on than supporting bloated, inefficient government.  That's only proposed new federal spending, I already pay property tax, sales tax, gas tax (presumably for 'infrastructure'), local income tax, state income tax, medicare, social security, and the corporate taxes, etc built into the good we buy.

All things considered, the bureaucrats are probably really close to controlling more of the wealth we produce than we are.  I am not against all taxes, but the way I see it the bureaucracy in DC is effectively a parasite which is bleeding us dry with debt and wasteful spending.  I don't know where all that money goes, but I'm certain obscene amounts are being wasted or even being spent on causes directly opposed to the interests of the citizens paying for this mess."

1,"Fauci was well aware that specific research into bat cornovirus was taking place at the Wuhan Virology Institute. He specifically approved funding of this type of research. Yet, early in the pandemic he pushed the line that the virus spontaneously popped up in a wet market in the same frigging city where they were studying this specific thing. 

He knew, he lied, and he may very well have been the cause of the entire massive catastrophe that COVID19 and will forever be.  It's not a stretch to make this claim. 

It is entirely possible that the man who was instrumental causing the deaths of over 4.5 million people and the loss of trillions of dollars in economic activity is in fact the same man that is being celebrated as a hero by people like Trevor Noah, John Oliver and others. In fact, there appears to be solid evidence to this.

Someone needs to ask him why he pushed the story that COVID 19 developed in nature when he was very well aware that research into that specific type of very unique virus was being funded by the NIH in the city where the virus originated."

DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO QUIETLY DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM DR FAUCI.   They need to be constantly reminded that the man they put on a pedestal is one of the main reasons we have this virus unleashed upon the world.   Every Democrat you know needs to be confronted with this."

2,I suspect a great deal is getting revealed when teachers watch their children's online classes.  The level of indoctrination occurring in these classrooms is beyond the pale.
2,"? I have all sorts of flags that I put up depending on what we are learning. Don’t tread on me… Soviet Union … nazi flag… Texas independence flag …. 

I feel like this is half a story. What other things were in the room ? I’m guessing a US flag and all sorts of things the parente approve of. And heaven forbid the teacher have some sort of activity where the kids have to self reflect on their own beliefs. 

I’m sad to watch republicanism become the party of censorship and identifying “wrong think” so many of us talk about the participation trophy ruining achievement (it did) but here we are. Angry cus someone doesn’t do something the way you want. 
 

I hear “indoctrination” all the time but really What that means is people want kids indoctrinated with THEIR viewpoints. Heaven forbid a kid is introduced to Both perspectives. 
Tax paid classroom. Pls. Taxes paid for the 4 walls. The teacher paid for everything else in the damn room.

That being said - if the T really just used this as a preaching block, they can preach on the street corner. I’d have to see their curriculum and lessons to really know though."

Millions busted their asses through the entire pandemic and made less money than the people leeching off our tax dollars.  In 9 months that will be an additional 7 million people on welfare.  With high wages, increased taxes, huge inflation on cost of goods all because of the current Marxist, authoritarian regime running this country, how many jobs will be around in a couple of months with 7 million people earning less than what they received in handouts.  Don’t forget to add rent to the equation.  The moratorium is over.  I hope I’m wrong, but I have a negative outlook on this economy."

1,"> 7 million people that sat around for a year. Who wants to hire that lazy sack. 

This is something I said early on.  If I'm a hiring manager and someone comes in looking for a job who last worked in February 2020, they had better have an explanation other than ""Unemployment paid more than working"" for why, or I won't touch them with a 10 foot pole."
1,"How could anyone hire someone that hasn’t workforce a year and a half?  I can’t imagine how demotivated an individual that literally did nothing for 18 months.  How will they wake up every morning ready to go to work?  

What I love most is the complete 180 the unions took to defend union members that do not want to take the vaccine.  The teachers union spent over a year telling the public how vaccines and masks are the key to open schools, now they want to fight against vaccine mandates.

These leftist clowns always implode on their own policies and ideology.  Defund the police , no don’t fund the police.  We need vaccines, no vaccine mandate.  1996 Biden, we need to lock up these animals, 2021 Biden, institutional racism.

1,"I want to push back in the idea that the Dems are outright hemorrhaging minorities.  I think it's important to qualify what's going on here with minorities starting to vote republican. 

Let's look at the 2020 election. The Trump campaign made significant investments in reaching specific minority communities eg. Tejanos in TX, American Indians in NC, and black men in general.

With the first two, the Trump campaign used messaging that spoke specifically  to those groups. Acknowledging their history, and issues specific to them. In contrast the Dems reached out to those groups as members of the ""BIPOC"" Community. The idea of BIPOC people as a group was created by the left and is defined by their ""shared oppression"". This allowed Trump to win groups which republicans never won.

Trump was able to blunt the Dem edge with black men both through his personal appeal and superior messaging. Saying, if I'm president the economy will be so good you can get rich. But again the Dems just lumped them under the BIPOC label and told them if you like trump you're not black.

In conclusion Trump was able to either blunt the Dem edge or win outright with specific minority groups by tailoring messaging for those groups and giving them an optimistic as opposed to a pessimistic message.  The takeaway is that Trump's approach is replicable and useful, but requires significant investments in crafting proper messaging and finding the right groups to target."
2,Biden recently put some visa restriction on people involved in the current genocide against the Tirgray and Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia. There's currently debate around a house resolution(H.R 445) to formally condemn Ethiopia and Eretria for genocide and crimes against humanity. Pompeo and Inhofe are lobbying on behalf of the Ethiopian and Eritrean government in opposition to Biden and most of congress.
1,"Great question. Sorry for not including information (this is something that is practically common knowledge in my circle - apologies)

See [

Also Twitter is a good metric as well [ 

Currently there is 0 coverage from MSM - in fact any coverage is anti-Ethiopia pro-interventionist (akin to Libya).

Here are some sources to why I thanked Senator Jim Inhofe & Sec. Pompeo.

* [Jim Inhofe](
* [Mike Pompeo]("
2,"The sad fact is that the narrative of ""Tigray Genocide""  has successfully reached the international audience, despite the facts on the ground.

* Cause of war was the Nov 4th attack by the TPLF (Tigray People's Liberation Front) - the ousted former ruling party of Ethiopia for over 30 years (BAD DUDES).
* Amharas have been ethnically cleansed from many areas  (Wollega, Mai Kadra, Chena, Agmasa, etc...)
* TPLF using Child Soldiers to continue their crusade in Afar & Amhara regions.

Yet TPLF has rebranded it's name (in name only) to TDF)and cries genocide while killing civilians of all ethnicities (Crocodile tears). 

In Ethiopia, there are 80+ ethnicities. Yet, TPLF (The Tigray Rebels) are literally the only faction which is actually using ethnicity as a target - yet you probably don't hear these narratives."
2,The MSM has [posted]( about the atrocities committed in Ethiopia.
1,"I haven't came across this NPR article - thanks for correcting my hyperbole.

Most outlets that reaches our circle Amnesty International, CNN, NYTimes, BBC, & The Telegraph has reported one sided stories that coverup or sympathize with the TPLF (the aggressor) by appealing to their ethnic base despite them even targeting their own who disagree.

Let me just give you a glimpse to what I'm referring to:

* NYTimes + Senator Coons makeup stories to blame the Ethiopian PM as cause.
   * [
* The Telegraph jumping through hoops to blame Ethiopians of Genocide.
   * [

There is so so so much more - if you know an Ethiopian talk to them and they'll tell you. At the moment MSM isn't reporting the facts (at best cherry picking & downplaying). I'll be doing my best to TLDR the series of events - I'm just one dude trying to clear the misinformation.

Seriously talk to an Ethiopian. Ask them about news coverage. Ask them about the Democratic Party & Biden. If what I say is a lie you'll see it reflected in their words.

Promise I'll centralize all the info. Currently, misdeeds are lost in Tweets & Local News - this shit is much deeper than they tell you."
1,I have a coworker who’s not from Ethiopia but her parents are. The way she tells it is that it started out as basically a group wanting their own freedom and then the bigger government coming in and squashing the attempts. So the little guys started taking hostages and killing civilians Vietnam style and then big government started ethnic cleansing. Basically just sounds fucked up all around.
2,"Unfortunately, you'll hear 2 stories and it's mostly divided on ethnic lines and allegiance.

If they're from Tigray (most likely but not universal) will tell you that story you shared.

Ethiopia has 80+ Ethnicities, but one political group (from Tigray) is trying to make a comeback after being ousted from power - after 30 years of being the ruling party. The TPLF is not a small guy - it's literally a political group that has used Racism to divide Ethiopia.

TPLF's aim is to make itself look like the good guy using it's operatives across the world. They are a rich & extremely corrupt group that got the boot due to a popular uprising.

Democracy has emerged; and ethno nationalism (their bread & butter) is under threat.

Imagine having the US dividing states based on ethnic lines (like This is for Whites Only, This is for Blacks Only, etc...) That's who they are... racism is a political opinion in their mind :)

Here's a joke

* Republican talks about race... they're a racist
* TPLF kills, borders & imprisons based on race... they're a fledgling democracy
* ^ That truly happened (Susan Rice & Barack Obama said that) ["

2,This is the state of politics. It all sucks
1,The whole daily death count ended as soon as Biden was in office too.
2,But I'm still blaming him for covid deaths and our troops and citizens in Afghanistan and our allies that are being killed
1,"Maybe it's time republicans stop complaining about double standards, and engage in them instead. 

Republicans should be ok with the idea of political persecution of Democrats in washington. 

Implement term limits, and keep your soul as the electorate, and there's no issue with the extremes republicans should go to when punishing democrats politically."
2,Really that is BS all they want to do is give money away to people who really don't deserve it
0,"Maybe because most Biden voters have been vaccinated and are no longer dying of Covid. To those who got the shot, the pandemic is no more dangerous than the flu. 

What more can a President do when everyone who is willing to listen has listened and now can go back to living a normal life?  Is he responsible for those who only listen to China-backed anti-vax disinformation?

1,"> Bruh that’s because everything Biden has been doing for corona has been just so much better than what Trump did

The only thing Biden has been doing for COVID is doling out the vaccines Trump had made, and trying to set up vaccine passports so minorities can't participate in the economy."
2,No lol it’s all media. All companies. All politicians. All subreddits etc. if they support the person then what they do wrong gets swept under the rug for the blame gets pushed to someone else. Iv seen it here plenty with random republicans. I see it over in every day.
2,The one he provided a bit of support to develop yet somehow his followers seem very prone to believe strange conspiracy theories about. Perhaps it would of helped if had started to actively promote it back in January when he secretly took the jab?  Maybe?  Possibly?

I am old enough to remember Bush Sr working towards a balanced budget since he felt deficit spending was deeply immoral. I am old enough to remember Reagan standing against authoritarian governments. I am not quite old enough,  but vaguely remember that Lincoln guy who fought *against* the Confederates in the Civil War. 

Gone is any desire for a smaller government and gone is any desire to have candidates that have a shred of personal character or stand up against authoritarian dictatorships such as Russia and N Korea."
2,The man is a damned disgrace. A national embarrassment.
1,You call that a president we call him joe biden
1,Biden is a piece of shit on a napkin
2,Yep. They celebrate a lifelong societal parasite but disrespect heroes who defend our country.
2,im 48 years old he is by far the worse world leader ive ever known
2,"It’s easy to explain 
One gives votes 
The other doesn’t…"
1,"biden makes me cry in embarrassment
can you believe people still support this guy? 😞"
1,He’s kneeling because he fantasizes about being the cop that did it.
1,Dems are the most spiteful obstinate group of reckless and morally corrupt people. All they want is to devastate the core foundations of decency all because someone they courted back in the early 2000s decided to not play ball with them and instead ran as their opposition. The strategy is to convey ineptitude and all the negatives they couldn’t pin on 45 during this potato regime. They embody all the worse they criticize in others. A self licking ice cream cone.

2,A literal nothing burger. Let's stop doing to Biden what they did to Trump.

Well, what can you do?"
1,Finally someone beats Jimmy Carter as the most worthless President in history although they both agreed that Middle East oil costs to much but there’s nothing we can do unless we hire someone more Trump-Like to take over for ole Joe.
2,"He did that as well when asked to speak about and that goes back 20 years. Checked his watch and said while he was answering questions post-speech that ""I'll take one more but I have to get outta here."" He has no soul, no conscience. It's all about Joe yet Joe is no longer all there."
0,And you've *never* committed any type of faux pas I assume?  The last handful of republican presidents have their fair share of them....  Have you ever been at a bar to watch a football game and didn't support the troops by not standing for the Televised national anthem?  Let they who is without sin cast the first stone
2,I think you mean drug addicted loser that threatened to shoot a pregnant woman in the belly that got caught trying to pass fake money to a store owner that wanted to fight with the police and became a hero. Wtf
2,"Simply my take, but Tik Tok is used for spying on people and collecting their personal private data. I don't think any military-related things should be documented on that nasty app."
2,when I was in we were told we can’t use it in places that require clearance. That was it really.
1,Express your opinions on sloppy Joe here is the red carpet
1,"if your sad over a druggie woman abuser  criminal , you have issues, Floyd was a vile ..trash.. person find someone else to feel sorry for , how about real victims, like Ashli Babbitt?, or does she not count cause she is white?"
1,"Why?  The third picture was him virtue signaling kneeling for the loser in the fourth picture, like the rest of the leftist dumbasses"
2,"Sadly, not an American citizen myself. I'm sorry to criticize your president, but I found his actions repulsive. I really don't care if he was a Republican or Democrat, it's irrelevant. What is relevant, however, are his actions."
1,"> Have you ever been at a bar to watch a football game and didn't support the troops by not standing for the Televised national anthem?

Right, because that's remotely in the same ballpark. Biden got these people killed, then couldn't be bothered to show an ounce of decorum for the 45 minute ceremony. He then went on to roll his eyes at the mother of one of the dead marines, among other things, and wouldn't shut up about his own son."
1,"Haha seriously? You have the Commander in Chief and hes checking the time instead of respecting the fallen soldiers of his FAILED PLAN. Yes, President Trump was going to evacuate the troops but sleepy Joe had no plan. He fucked up, he disrespected the fallen soldiers for making sure it wasnt time to take his dementia medication. Joe is a joke."
1,"In this case, those people were dead explicitly because of the actions he took.  Had he followed Trump's plan, we'd have been out of the country months before that attack occurred."
2,"Officer had to stand his ground. Gave plenty of warning not to enter cross that doorway. I fell very sorry for Ashley’s family but the force the officer used was justified in this case. 

In the case of Floyd. It’s well documented that he should not have used that amount of force. Digging up someone’s past to try and justify it after the fact doesn’t work."
0,Ignorant statements like that are the reason a lot of centrist think this sub and Republicans are racist. I hope you realize how wrong you are one day.
2,3rd picture is him doing a cringe kneel only for political points. Not because he actually cares about the situation.
2,"If you're not an American, frankly, I don't give a damn.  If you haven't been living under a rock you'd understand that this was a forever war and nobody was going to pull out perfectly.  20 years, hundreds of thousands of lives lost, yet all you care to critique are the few thousand people warned to leave that didn't and 12 of the thousands of soldiers that have already died?  The entire last decade was a disgrace and you can scrutinize the actions of the last 3 presidents but *this one* ooooh this one really screwed the pooch?  Grow up"
1,"Oh, adding in extras to move the goalposts?  The initial critique was a still image, which in sure you'll agree are extremely easily taken out of context... honestly I'm my opinion you and I and every American got those soldiers killed, along with the thousands of other US soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Afghan soldiers that have died over the last two decades for supporting this war not just in the first place but along the way.  There was *never* going to be a clean pull out no matter who was in office. Period. 

The difference here is that Sundowning Irish Joe (or likely the people around him) saw that he doesn't seem to care or realize there's an election coming up so they ended it."
1,"Your argument re: Babbitt would be correct, IF she had actually crossed through the doorway - she had not, he shot her THROUGH the doorway and she fell on the other side of the door because she had not crossed through at that point

Home owners have been prosecuted for shooting through the doorway at someone attempting to crash through their door - there is fear, but insufficient fear of imminent death or great bodily harm as long as the aggressor is on the OTHER side of the door (like Babbitt)"
2,He was a junkie who robbed a pregnant woman by holding a gun to her belly. We'd be calling him a total pos no matter what color they are. Stop being stupid
2,Politicians made a movie out of him
1,"The Dumbocrats don't care about ANYONE except themselves - sure, it's virtue signaling for political brownie points - doesn't make it any less vile"
2,"> If you're not an American, frankly, I don't give a damn. 

Maybe you forgot that it wasn't only American troops fighting in Afghanistan. Coalition forces had soldiers from many other nations. For example the British had close to 500 dead, the Italians 100ish, etc etc (and many more were wounded and will most likely suffer the consequences of that for the rest of their lives). You're spitting on their graves with that statement. Have a modicum of empathy, for fuck's sake."
2,"I sense hostility. No need for that.

We need to clear a couple of things: first, this is not about the war in Afghanistan as a whole. Second, this is not about drawing comparisons between Biden and the last three presidents, it's about this one particular instance.

I understand why my opinion may not matter to you, because this is your country, not mine. And I respect that. I have always respected Americans for their patriotism.

It's also absolutely fine to discuss different opinions. Mine, for instance, is that an American president should be more mindful of his behavior. Yours may be different.

Let's come together, and in words of Joe Biden during his inauguration speech, ""We can treat each other with dignity and respect""."
2,"Yeah,  because it's not like there were blockades and checkpoints preventing Americans from leaving right?"
2,Another thing I forgot to add. Shooting through a closed door isn’t the same as a police officer defending congressmen as they evacuate the building. Seems like we have slightly different views but I really appreciate you keeping it light as opposed to immediately name calling and cursing like a lot of folks do
2,But we are the racists they are the communist Marxist
2,Just because I don’t believe the same thing you do doesn’t make me a liberal. You’re welcome to review my comment history I’m on here a lot. I just keep call out people the few times I feel it’s necessary
2,"The blockades that prevented Americans from getting through were at the airport gate and staffed by the US military.

What is preventing 6 planeloads of people - including Americans - from leaving right now, is the US State Department."
2,Case law has been consistent - until the aggressor is actually on the other side of a doorway and capable of presenting real imminent threat - it's not justified to shoot
1,"Except there were in fact no congressmen in the building - it had already been emptied when this happened

Recall that AOC was in a completely different building - later claiming she had to hide in her bathroom because people were going to her - even though there was absolutely no one there"
1,I lost my lunatic-lefty cherry back at the end of 2015
2,">   The initial critique was a still image,  which in sure you'll agree are extremely easily taken out of context

To

> To critique the comment you brought in additional evidence 

So you both want to dismiss the image for having no context, then whine about someone introducing additional context? That's... an interesting take.

> you brought in additional evidence that was not part of the initial argument, moving the goal posts.

Kudos for showing you can read but not comprehend, and are so lacking understanding that you think introducing evidence in a debate is a logical fallacy. That's absolutely precious."
2,"I just rewatched the video again. 



I’m not going to pretend I have any knowledge whatsoever about case law or anything castle doctrine. I’m just a guy on Reddit. 

What I see is a justified shooting. Since the officer was cleared of the shooting I’m guessing others thought that as well."
2,"This is a statement from Chief of Police following that day 

“As protesters were forcing their way toward the House Chamber where Members of Congress were sheltering in place, a sworn USCP employee discharged their service weapon, striking an adult female.  Medical assistance was rendered immediately, and the female was transported to the hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries.  She has been identified as Ashli Babbitt.”"
2,Yeah I do know about the AOC thing. But I’m under the impression that there were a few reps In the “gallery of House of Representatives” is that not in the same building?
2,"This isn't castle doctrine related - the only issue in situation like this is whether the cop had a legitimate fear for IMMINENT death or great bodily harm - in the process or climbing through a window isn't there yet - imminence doesn't accrue until the person is on your side of the door and in a position to cause imminent harm

Officer was ""cleared"" of the shooting by the Capitol Hill police - of course he was

That's like the Chicago Police having initially cleared the dumbass who illegally shot that Laquan McDonald buffoon"
0,What threat did an unarmed woman pose to an armed secret service officer. He could have fired a warning shot or he could have moved to arrest her when she came through the window. There was also a swat team at babits rear coming up the stairs which I imagine had contact via radio with the shooter. You can see them signal eachother with a thumbs up after the shot
2,"The standard CYA statement - like the CPD tried in the McDonald (and a lot of other) cases

They were ""sheltering in place"" in a completely OTHER building - video that was shown of the chamber at the time shows it was empty"
2,"> in the process or climbing through a window isn't there yet - imminence doesn't accrue until the person is on your side of the door and in a position to cause imminent harm

Particularly given that there was a second door between them."
2,"People who’s job is to decide whether lethal force or not is authorized chose to acquit the officer. I’m going to side with them. 

You also just used the exact same argument that the loved ones of Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, and countless others have used. Did you defend them the same way?"

1,"Fauci lied, people died"
2,This is a really beautiful quote. I think if we could approach conversations from this perspective both sides could accomplish a lot more.
1,"Modern Democrats often confuse disagreeing with the solution with disagreeing that there's a problem. Take for example climate change. There's a vast majority that believe in it... We just don't believe we can get our way out of climate issues with wind turbines and solar panels, and wished that you just let us finishing building more nuclear like Republicans wanted to back in the 70s"
0,"i got a good one too!

""the first amendment is first for a reason, and the second amendment is just incase the first doesn't work out."" - Dave Chappelle"
2,"if we judged policies on results instead of goals, half of the disagreements would solve themselves"
1,"We have better answers than liberals do, and they know that, which is why they make an entirely emotional argument rather than trying to argue policy."
0,"Liberals : okay, time to boycott and censor this obviously racist washed up actor"
1,"Actually it is a difference in heart. They don’t care about people, only power. Why else would they want to restrict us, then open our borders to illegal immigrants coming in with a 40% COVID case rate?"
2,"It also does not help that clean, cheap, easy-to-refuel reactors could have been a thing back in the '40s and '50s but were not because Admiral Hyman Rickover didn't want anything nuclear that did NOT generate plutonium.

Several great reactor designs that cannot melt down were created. In the event of failure, they shut the reaction off. Most of them ran on thorium salts and not uranium. Therefore, no plutonium.

That made the Admiral unhappy because no plutonium = no big booms."
2,"Unfortunately, a large part of our party does not hold this view.  I, however, am on your side and believe environmentalism and environmental stewardship is a bi-partisan issue that we all can agree on in some form"
2,"But the reason why it ended up as the 1st is that the original first two amendments weren't ratified.

""Our"" 1st amendment wasn't listed first by Congress because it it was so important, it was originally the 3rd of the first 12 amendments.

The states didn't ratify the first two amendments, so 3 became 1."
2,"It's more about the people - not the government. For citizens who vote liberal or conservative, it's often a difference in mind. For government officials... sometimes it's a bit questionable."
2,"Conservatives might say it's liberals that are hurting people.

Unlike some other political arguments in the past, mosern-day politics aren't just about ""we both know the facts but have different opinions"" - instead they're about ""we both believe different facts, and thus, different opinions.""

The worst part is, the side who's wrong will believe 100% that they are right. So there's no way to truly know who is right and who is wrong."
2,"Oh you mean like by forcing small businesses around the country to close down permanently, killing competition and crushing the economy, causing crime, homelessness, suicide, preventable disease and third-world starvation to skyrocket?"
2,"Yes I agree, and I don't like it.

That being said, it's been far easier for me as a nuclear advocate to convince a right winger to support nuclear power than to have a left winger support nuclear.

The left bludgeoned the right with emotional appeal and NIMBYism to shut down our stance on nuclear in the general public, meaning that the only options left if you knew solar and wind wouldn't do anything would be to either be silent and keep voting... Or throw your hands in the air. It's so easy to bring right wing republicans who don't believe in climate change back to believing in reasonable stances on environmentalism as long as A) it's incremental and B) you validate their concerns. Same thing I've done with most topics.

And, to be honest, if the right says don't spend money and not solve the problem, and the left says spend more money on something that won't solve the problem... I think not spending money is still a better option.

It's so irritating if you look at it and see how the the nuclear regulatory commission called a lot of the anti nuclear attacks ""leftist trash"" all the way back in the 80s. If they let us keep going we would have been like France and this wouldn't have been an issue."
2,"As a hard left winger, yeah yeah I know, not supposed to post, I actually agree with your stance on nuclear and also support nuclear power. I really think the energy generation stuff is a problem on both sides... with dumb republicans talking about bringing back coal as a major energy source, and dumb people on my side shutting down ideas like nuclear as efficient ways of generating clean energy.

The problem with don't spend money and don't solve the problem is no steps are being made towards solving the problem. Not saying spending money is great, but it can at least create progress to a solution if well managed.

Now whether you think the left can manage it well is of course a valid concern... I also believe government is wasteful and stupid in many situations after all."
2,"To be fair, I’m somewhat left leaning and super into nuclear.  It’s not a lost cause.  I actually find a lot of the older more conservative men who don’t know much about nuclear are the ones still quite nervous about it!"
2,"Hey man, in this polarized time I'm happy to find common ground. One of my best friends since I moved to GA is a traditional auth left guy, and when we have to talk politics that's our common ground we loop back to.

It is true both sides have their derps, we just need to reel them in. I remember being 'shut down' by someone on the left calling me a climate change denier because I said renewables can't fill our energy needs.

And I get that nothing is being done if you do nothing... But sometimes if you're given two shitty options I'd rather we do the least shitty one. 

As an example, let's say we told two people to each pick up a cinder block and carry it 100m east. If one person is fiddling with the block and then walking 30m south, and the other is kind of sitting there... That would mean the person sitting there is putting us in a better position.  That's how I view it; if we spend ungodly sums of money in renewable tech that won't solve the problem were essentially wasting money. Don't get me wrong, I think the gov should be, in general, supporting tech advancements... But we need to prioritize. If we took half the renewable funds and gave it to the scientists and engineers trying to make  nuclear stations cheaper or faster to construct, it would have actually made a dent.

Cheers to finding common ground, from a right winger to a left winger!"
1,"Not to keep pointing fingers back and forth, but the resistance to nuclear power really is a primarily left-wing phenomenon in politics. The sooner we all get behind it though, the better!"
2,I could see why. Nuclear is a clean and reliable power source but accidents do happen
2,"Yep, you guys just also have to work on your older conservative ally’s that really only have poor knowledge of the (mostly man made) disasters of the past.  People like me will work the left. 
Most libs I know are in favour of a *diverse* energy economy.  More wind, yes. More solar, yes. Nuclear additions, yes. nationally refined oil products, yes.  Not everyone left wing is ultra progressive, just like not everyone right wing is alt-right extreme. There’s a middle ground somewhere with a lot of overlap on these issues."
2,"In the documentaries I’ve watched, the ‘major’ accidents have been due to negligence.   I’m definitely open to links citing otherwise, however, it’s my understanding that Chernobyl for example was a direct result of plant management ignoring power source protocols and straight up causing an avoidable disaster (trying to cover it up obviously didn’t help) and 3 mile island for another example, was the result of a leak that was not registered by any sort of sensor or properly maintained and was an entirely avoidable incident in itself as well.  Sadly, communication technology wasn’t at the level it has been at for the last couple decades to lead to faster, more experienced troubleshooting either.  Both examples are tragic and damaging to the psyche, but, when studied, the argument of how dangerous they are lessens as the argument for human error grows."
2,"Exactly. I was literally just watching a Chernobyl technical documentary last night and it explained what happened and why. The engineers allowed the nuclear reactor to enter an unstable state without realizing what had happened, and then had pulled too many control rods out causing the reactor to overheat and explode"

2,"An insightful linguistic analysis of the former inciter-to-chaos-in-chief. His most 'favorable' characteristic that Mr. McWhorter describes is ""Artful"". And it is true that he was The Showman president who we're all trying to get over, but of course the narcissist must be On Stage. Not aesthetic, though, and (for me) not artful. too much icing on the cake. The American Cake that used to be American Pie. Now it's just Yesteryear.

That's called ""RETALIATION"", and something I can seriously relate to when I use to be verbally bashed in grade school, and it wasn't until I reached High School when I started retaliating..... Yes, over the past 5 years, from 2016 to 2021, all I heard was the Dems & Libs bashing & bashing & bashing/365 for 4 years, and President Trump retaliating & retaliating & retaliating..... and all I saw was the Dems & Libs rioting at ""INSIDE"" the US Capital in 2017 (yes, they broke inside & rioted), and there were countless street riots all over the country during President Trumps entire term......

Why don't we start calling him ""Sore Looser Trump.' People seem to like childish talk."
1,Trump is a know it all

0,"Name me one, just ONE, ""Conservative"" policy in the last 50 years that has actually helped the majority of Americans. Ever since Nixon, conservatives agenda has been to tell the Middle Class that the poor were stealing from them, while at the same time, instituting policies that shifted the resources of this country into the hands of a few of the already very wealthy.

0,"THIS. THIS is why I tune in here, to hear the ROTpublicans try to divine the Secrets of the Capitalist Universe on their own. How do I know on their own? Because they WON'T LISTEN TO ANYONE ELSE. They won't listen to blacks of any stripe; they won't listen to Hispanics. They won't listen to women, or Libs, or Progressives, or children, or ANYONE who insists that the idea of God has to pass even the most feeble standards of discussion, or science, or even education. And why do they hyperventilate so? Because THEIR idea of what God is, can't pass even those abbreviated tests.

ROTpublicans proudly stand for ALL the rest of us, those groups I detailed above, just pulling in our unruly noses, and letting them ride roughshod over us and our priorities.

And since ROTpublicans HAVE NO MORALS to speak of, they are not willing to just go home when they DON'T HAVE THE MAJORITY. No, they've got to then STEAL the votes, by screwing up the entire voting system... and KEEPING it screwed up in a ROTpublican direction.

Our task now is to stop that from happening. Period."

Dictate whether or not a couple can decide to ADOPT because pregnancy has PROVEN to be a 'threat' to the woman's life...
2,"His comment of ""High Priest or High Priestess of abortion"" is in reference to the fast growing Pagan religions and shows his bigotry. I hope that is obvious. He is appealing to the Evangelical base. As he hypocritically says that Parties shouldn't appeal to their bases. Disgusting!"

The people need the whole truth about who Trump truly is... Everything!! All his lies and not paying anyone and the sexual abuse and any and every thing he should be in jail for but his money made him above the law like he's better then all of them!!! Everything needs to come out with proof like court records......
0,"Grumpy Old Party hardly conveys the true depth of malice that ruling Republicans are guilty of these days!. Such a cute-worded description as, ""grumpy old party"" to describe the right is like saying,. ""Yeah, they've done some bad things,  but, they meant well.""  Already there is a great problem with Republican's blatantly, shamelessly lying  and denying, plus refusing  to acknowledge the damage they have done, all to please Donald J. Trump. Please don't use endearing words to describe any of them until we know the depth of their involvement . They are a terrorist gang now, with crimes against America too numerous to mention. Many right-wing politicians became traitors on the day insurrectionists impersonated patriots as they violated America. And now for some bizarro reason-they defy helping America end the pandemic. They are willing to even put their own children's lives at stake to ""own the libs""  they say. That's not even the American thing to do.  Who are these people who think they are patriots and why don't they realize they are acting more like bullies or terrorists themselves?"

2,"The guy arguing about abortion as an issue for Democrats (or even GOP), is out of touch with the current reality."
1,"I'm very optimistic for the republican party. Eventually, the republican party will part with the minority of people in their party who are militant racists, which is great. 
Trump is not a republican; he is his own entity. 
And he is causing an acceleration of change in the republican party, which I'm happy about. 
The democrats are fooling themselves if they think there are no racists in their party.
The democratic party is loaded with racists,too, I beleive. 
My hope is that the republican party will soon roll out the red carpet for conservative democrat minorities to swing to the republican party, and the core beliefs of conservatism, which starts with less government."

2,"Many Republicans cringe and want him to go away, but how many are uttering a single word to that effect?"
0,"Having Trump with the Republican party is like having skid marks with your tighty-whities. 
It's just best to throw them out and start with a new, fresh pair. Washing, scrubing and bleaching in Trump's case just won't remove any stains.

2,Trump how come nothing being done about it Trump
2,Did the Police Department pay for the damage?
1,Awsome...I love it. Paybacks. Blue lives matters. Trump2020 Baby. ✝️🇺🇸
2,For sure they are slashing Antifa cars!
2,Plot twist: civilians have acquired tire popping tech as of too!
2,"Maybe the second amendment folks, they can do something?"
0,They prevent the cars from being used for driving into crowds of peaceful BLM protesters. They are potentially saving many lives.
0,"I can't believe this. We are paying these POS cops out of our taxes, to slash people's tires?"
2,The cops get bottles and hammers thrown at them so they slash some tires.I call that a tradeoff.
2,They are protesting the decision for “defund the police”.
2,"So this property damage is bad, but the burning, looting and rioting in US cities is just fine? smh"
0,"vandalism by the police...remember this when someone defends the police as ""public safety"""
0,The only good cop is a dead cop
2,"Caught in the act, and try to blame vandals and looters. Corruption. Who gave the orders to do this."
2,"Black Tires Matter! Seriously, what am I even looking at, what are they doing?!"
2,Until law enforcement qualified immunity is taken away from them this will continue to happen

2,is this criminal not in this?????
0,"If the people really wanted to they could swarm the police for there are more of us than of them and use the same force on them as they use on us. Buy teargas shields body armor and yes even use weapons, The U.S. Constitution say when one acts outside the oath he wars with the Constitution and ceases to have any authority. They think they can control the streets, when ""We the People"" get fed up their is no limit to our resolve."
0,"That is evidence of vandalism, the mayor of Minneapolis should take action and if these police  do not come forward then prosecute the lieutenant what a poor excuse of law enforcement, wanted vandalism, charges, actions unbecoming of an officer, violation of police policy, dereliction of duty not reporting their crimes, fraud( waste of tax payers money ), we pay them to vandalize peoples automobile a whole parking lot full of cars.  If more people see this then I think the mayor won't be mayor much longer especially come election time."
2,"Cops doing this could be threatening protesters' very lives, if they ever do this to middle-class people protesting in a ghetto neighborhood.  When the protests are over the protesters, unable to drive home, will be at the mercy of neighborhood thugs."

0,we see who the real terrorists are...FTP...ACAB
0,Bootlickers pulling of some mental gymnastics to defend and deflect from the terrorism of law enforcers.
2,"So, did you bother to ask (investigate why) the police for a reason for this? I truly doubt they did it for the fun of it, and if so, they should pay out of their own pockets. However, what is the reason behind the police slashing tires? Maybe safety?"
2,Why do the police carry knifes??????
1,"""praying""  God will not hear the prayers of those that married same sex,  it is an abonation
to Him.   God loves us who we are,  but He is our judge,  in the end.  Choose this day in whom you shall serve

1,"Are you people seeing what at 1:43 Obama says its not about how you start out as if , he's sending our children on the way to conversion of this lifestyle, and he was about to make the same point about out you intercourse right after that."
2,Another unsustainable ploy for Satan worshipers
1,"Poor American children, they're going to live in a country full of sexual degradation, were their is no clear definition of the roles set up by mother nature and also where their lowest animal instincs take first place. All in the name of, do what ever makes you happy as long as you don't hurt nobody. What a bunch of BS."
2,WAIT! WHO APPOINTED SIMONA GOD? GOD IS GOD NOT YOU! AND YOU WILL BOW YOUR KNEES AND DIRTY HEART BEFORE HIM COME JUDGMENT DAY AND BE FOUND GUILTY!
1,Being Gay has nothing to do with being an American!. Dang G I thought you were a Nica. You just a pawn. Can't wait till the next President hopefully they will undo all this Gayness and get back to business like Bush.
2,"Hey look, it's all Barack Osama ever did in his career!"
1,"A key aspect to a happy world is harmony. Harmony consists everybody. Harmony is influential. Happiness is influential. Those two things don't exist in the overall human race because of a lot of set backs. One key thing that divides the human race is the difference in ethics. Good ethics or morals are principles that contribute to Good conduct and good conduct is a positive influence that contribute to harmony. Good ethics should be universal around the earth just like a smile generally means happiness around earth.

Here's the thing. Besides all the crime and misery that contribute to this sick world that has it's negative influence, you also have loose morals (let's say loose conduct for better understanding) and loose conduct has it's negative influence. Example, parents that regularly curse around their kids might influence their kids even if they tell them not to do it. Homosexuality, is, loose, conduct. It has it's influence as you can clearly see around you in today's world. It, contributes, negatively, to, humanity. How?

Homosexuality challenges the importance of ethics, logic and reasoning. Three common things you need for wisdom and Three common things that are challenged in committing crimes like murder, domestic violence, rape etc.. When you challenge those things in regards to the ethics of sexuality, it attacks the meaning of ethics in general and attacks the human cognition like, 'if I could do this I could do even more' which could lead to recklessness. It also attacks the meaning on quality of life, like how a person experiences life. Influence effects your motivations and your mental and physical wellbeing, and it's contagious because it effects you and everyone else.

So how is homosexuality truly beneficial to those doing it and to humanity? The world is like a family household, if one thing is out of place, everything is. So we all have a part on contributing to earth and humanity, it's best to be in harmony not disarray. But this world won't be in harmony with loose conduct, that's one key reason why the world is the way it is today.

NO ONE is born Gay. There is no scientific proof that people are born Gay. There is ZERO proof. ZERO! There is not a ""Gay Gene."" This is a fairy tale. People believe deceptive lies. They say, ""Gays were born that way."" That's just as ignorant as saying, ""Child Molesters were born that way."" Or ""Thieves were born that way."" Or ""Adulterers were born that way."" HOW STUPID! WHAT A GREAT BIG LIE! NO! People are NOT born Gay. People are born with a CHOICE! People are not ""born that way."" People are born with a CHOICE! LIFE IS A CHOICE! People are born with a CHOICE! People CHOOSE right or wrong. People choose to live for God or for themselves. They CHOOSE to walk in darkness or walk in light. And people will be judged by God for the choices they make. NO! People are NOT born Gay. People are born with a CHOICE!

God's Word is perfectly clear. It says Gay, Homosexuality and Lesbianism is wrong. Gays, Homosexuals and Lesbians will not go to Heaven...they will go to Hell! [1 Cor.6:9,10]. The the sexually immoral... their place will be in the fiery Lake of Burning Sulfur."" [Rev.21:8]. God's Word calls homosexuality ""degrading of the body, shameful, indecent and perversion."" [Rom.1:24-32]. NO! People are NOT born Gay or ""born that way."" People are born with a CHOICE! A CHOICE to choose right or wrong. A choice to live for themselves and their selfishness or to live for God. ""Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve."" [Josh.24:15]. People are born with a CHOICE! They CHOOSE whom they will serve. P.S. Even if a person were born Gay, which is a BIG lie, people can be changed by being ""Born Again"" and by SELLING OUT THEIR LIFE 100% TO CHRIST!"

Join in the joyful celebration and help us prepare for all of the work that still lies ahead!  Your contribution to equality today will be matched dollar for dollar – up to $1.25 million. This extraordinary gift from the estate of John Barham and Dick Auer honors their legacy and will propel our movement forward.



The far-right will surely try to pass ""religious-freedom"" laws to try to deprive gay married couples of their equal rights.  Should they do so, Lambda Legal will be there to fight for those rights in court."
0,President Obama will go down in history as the first Black President but also as the first Gay President in the sense that he appointed two Supreme Court justices in Kagan and Sotomayor who were able to interpret the Constitution and the 14th. Amendment and found that bans on Gay Marriages were UnConstitutional. I am very proud to have voted for him twice.
2,"Asking For Help From The Greatest Power There Is.  
You owe it to your American family members that fell at places like Gettysburg, Normandy and Iwo Jima.  You owe it to your current American family and to family members not yet born and whom you will never see but most importantly, you owe it to yourself.

You are now facing the strongest opponent to American freedom that America has ever known and the odds of survival seem long.  How did we succeed in the past against tyranny, oppression and assault? 

Some might say that we sent our former family members into battle with the best technology and resources available and they would be partly right.  But our true strength has always resided in our steadfast faith in God.  Our belief that our cause was just and that it was by God’s hand that we would prevail.  

Let us renew that trust and faith and accept the promise of help in dark times.   Let us unleash the greatest power in creation and call upon our creator to help us in the shadow of what seems to be the death of our Republic.  One nation under God and in God we trust is the cornerstone of this nation. 

And so on Wednesday, July 8th let all God loving members of the American family and across the globe unite in prayer that first begins by acknowledging that without Jesus Christ we can do nothing and with Jesus Christ all things are possible for His glory. That in our own words we ask for guidance and direction to do our part in restoring the founding principals of this nation.  And if inclined to do so, share those prayers with others by posting on YouTube.   (Please share this message)"

1,"that's fucking disgusting, gay marriage isn't normal marriage, seriously these americans are fucked up in the head, what's next?  marrying a horse?"
1,"How is it that homosexuals condemn Christians for their opinion on homosexuality but yet allow a Christian ordained minister to marry them? Jesus loved all people but i don't think Jesus would ever support gay marriage.Jesus Christ underscored the importance and sacredness of lifelong marriage in his own teachings.He quoted from both Genesis 1 and 2,stating in Matthew 19:13-6 that God had created humanity as male and female,and that in marriage""the two will become one flesh.Therefore what God has joined together,let no one separate.Man maid anti law can never be natural law."

Now, he hails gay marriage. What a fucking hypocrite asshole we have as president. No wonder Democrats try to gain gay votes by passing gay mariage through their liberal contacts at the Supreme Court."

To know I live amongst such evil, homophobic people is utterly frightening and disgusting, it's no surprise to see scripture being quoted and the rather banal, supercilious ""i'm holier than thou"" attitudes. Honestly, whatever cult you subscribe to, your god or cow, whichever you prefer, can go fuck itself. The book you abide by is nothing more than primitive scare tactics. How pathetic that in the era of information we're still falling pray to poorly written, out-dated, evidence lacking, illliterature. This is why the U.S. gets so much flak, because we're a broken nation and the root of it is religion i.e, lack of reason, sheer stubbornness. Put down the gosh darn books and put your morality on the front line and ask yourselves aside from your ignorant ideologies, why you feel entitled to spout your bullshit on the gay and lesbian community as if it holds any weight? You people are too far gone for even Asclepius to heal... I feel as stupid as those I speak of for even entertaining their asinine beliefs. Hail to equality and may the U.S. continue to break down these barriers."

2,"The Supreme Court consists of nine justices, each one was UN-ELECTED by the people and serve life time tenures. Let me check my memory and I see there was another government entity in the last millennium  that was also UN-ELECTED and served for their entire life, that’s right, a KING. History tells us what our founding fathers thought of such a government entity when they gave King George V a big “F  you” when they signed the Declaration of Independence. Today we have  a Supreme Court that is governing just like a king, using judicial decrees to make law, a form of judicial activism that has no legitimate place in the highest court of the land. If the Supreme Court wants to become a political entity of our three branches of government, of which in my opinion they have firmly established with their recent rulings, then they should be subject to the same process as the other two branches, the legislative and executive, and that is an ELECTION. No longer should Supreme Court justices be nominated by the president and then approved by the senate. These justices should be elected by the people through a national election, like any other political entity in a DEMOCRACY."

Jesus said sexual immorality, which includes Homosexuality, make a person ""unclean, defiled and polluted!"" God's Word says, ""Keep the marriage bed undefiled, uncontaminated, unsoiled, for God will judge the sexual immoral."" [Heb.13:4]. God will judge the Sexually Immoral and all sex outside of the marriage bed. The marriage bed is to be uncontaminated."

2,This video shoild be used to show how dumb people are.I mean do tgey hate so much that they will vote for a idiot.
0,"He attacked trump because all trump does is attack people. Oh god, please let us start culling the willfully ignorant."
2,"I'm Republican and I will vote for Gary Johnson this year. The main difference between pro-Trump Republicans and anti-Trump Republicans is about 60 IQ points. Edit for Trump supporters: 60 IQ points is equal to 4 standard deviations. Yes, I am insulting you."
2,"Mr. Kool aid likes trump, huh?"
1,I see mostly positive comments but more dislikes. Those are those Hillary supporters who have no interest in actually discussing any issues and know that any debate will result in their embarrassment.
1,"My entire family  support the  democrat  candidates all the time , but this time we all are for Trump. Hillary has no moral and ethic, and her policies will make his country a sh$t hole, a paradise for rapists, illegals and drug dealers. If she thinks that she  is in comfortable positions,  and will win  the election based on the recent  poll then she is living on a fantasy world. When any one will go to the poll on/2016, the only things that matter is who has the better agenda for this country between Trump and Hillary. All the medias are bias, and I am saying it  again as a  lifelong democrat."
1,"Make no mistake, their son is an American hero, he made the ultimate sacrifice for this country........not the parents! The parents were used like puppets for the DNC, and in my eyes it was in poor taste. All to push their narrative. Like it or not Trump will be the next President, and as a veteran....I can't wait."
2,"Good job America, we really fucked ourselves this time"
2,I wonder how many people that commented and disliked the video actually voted 🤔
0,My god. Hilary's a psychopath cuz she lies? So trumps a what now? Would he be like a super psychopath? Just goes to show trump backers don't really care what he says. Apparently u can insult yer way to the presidancy
1,"I'm a Trump supporter; and if you think Trump supporters are ignorant,  I dare any of you Hillary Clinton bootlickers to debate me!"
0,How about we keep Obama.
2,This election got me feeling like I'm in the twilight zone.
1,"Has anyone bother to look into Mr Khan association with the Clinton's Foundation?  Someone called him out that he's getting paid by the Clinton's.  Confirm / Deny?  
Mr Khan's son die as a hero and people of this country (at least I am) is forever grateful for his sacrifice.  It's just feel wrong that he would use his son's honor to benefit people like the Clintons."
0,"Can we just ""accidentally"" bomb Trump rallies a couple of times?"
2,"why dont you guys actually look up the khan family mr. khan has been active in politics for a while, you might be surprised what you find. these guys sound a lot more intelligent than the videos i see of hillary diehards. its interesting how some videos have more views in a shorter amount of time but never get featured on trending."
0,Excuses excuses.........all of them are pathetic. Typical of Trump supporters.
0,Clinton 48 % - trump 41 % so far ..Thank The Lord this ignorant will not lead the USA :D
2,You fucking fools. Fuck both Hillary and trump. Fuck White Supremacy
2,"Not a Trump supporter, but I do appreciate these people acting and speaking civil during the interview. A lot of Trump supporters are shown to be ruthless and just outright douches through the media, so this is refreshing to know that there are well mannered Trump supporters."
2,"2:04 ""Miss Hillary Clinton""}
uhhh.....
she married dood."
1,is this the best the left has ? weak as hell
0,As a Canadian I'm sorry to say but you Trump supporters are pretty fucking stupid.
0,Trump followers scare me!  They remind me of Jim Jones' followers.
1,Khan is a Shill placed in the line of fire.... Intentionally by the Dems...
2,Trump Assures Supporters His Approach Will Work
0,"Trump doesn't know the constitution, he said the khan family had no right to say that about him...freedom of speech is a part of the first amendment😂😂😂"
0,"called Mexican immigrants rapists
would date his daughter 
wife copies the first lady's speech
Threatens everyone he's going to sue them but doesn't
Makes fun of the disable 
Makes fun of the poor ( you can see a video of that in his old biography)
Hasn't released his tax returns 
Makes fun of dead soldiers' family and religion because they are Muslim 
Says he's read the constitution but clearly hasn't (you can tell by his tweets)
Black Lives Matters protesters get harshly kicked out of his rally's 
Want's the rich not to pay tax
Melania trump is in many magazines nude ( first lady huh? ) 
Has been  bankrupt four times
calls women pigs 
Changes opinions many times like knowing Putin ( STUPID Alert )
 -well these are SOME THINGS about Trump , he would make such a good president NOT !
                            FUCK TRUMP AND THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT HIM"
2,you gonna tell me Hillary is insane and crazy then what the Fuck is Donald trump!!!!
2,I hope trump loses and Hillary gets assassinated or visa versa but Hilliard work be less bad until her assassination.
2,"Khan was paid 25k to give the speech, and they gave him the speech as well, along with the constitution.......btw he lost his son, it was the establishment that sacrificed him......"
0,Trying to reason with and understand right wing Teabaggers is a hopeless mission. it would be easier to teach a dog to understand binomial coefficients.  These folks have there head so firmly implanted in fox news anything outside of the conservative narrative is beyond their comprehension.
2,Never get into a battle of Wits with an unarmed man.
2,"i didnt know police had to be perfect. I thought police officers are humans.

i always find it odd how ppl that know the law never sign up and join police academy"
2,THIS cop was the COOLEST!  We need more like him.
2,That cop took all of this in good humor.
2,Please.. Whites are  getting this attitude from cops too..
2,Cop mentality in a nutshell thinking somebow a badge makes them some super citizen. “Why are you comparing apples to oranges?”
0,Cops don't know shit about laws. They just want to beat you up and kill you.
0,"Yes, I love every bit of this! Why do this cop thinks he his above the law? Same game, same warning, and same interrogation. Wait until the chief sees this? Both of them got some explaining to do. Moving Entrapment? Gavin is the man verifying impersonation and the criminal intent!"
2,I love this guy I hope he does to every cop he ever comes across this guy is my hero
2,He is now in exile in Mexico
2,He is 100%  correct he has the right chellage  the police  who is NOT  in uniform and the car is NOT marked as patrol car. THAT WHY police have uniform etc..
2,Prob 911 caused prob
2,Wtffff 🤣🤣 cop said fu
2,"I hope people aren't stupid enough to try to copy this. At no point was that guy actually in control of that situation. The only reason he wasn't immediately arrested is because the cop happened to be a laid back guy and decided to be patient and let him run his mouth. If anyone, white or black tried that with 99% of cops they would be in cuffs instantly. This cop is just one of the few relaxed ones out there."
0,All these cops want to do is hang somebody. We were supposed to stop that in the 1900's
2,Thumbs to both the cop and the citizen!
2,I love that cop he should be a governor
2,It seems strange! In Australia cops can do what they want!
2,"Not nerves, RIGHTS! More citizens should do same..."
2,i like watching these videos cause they funny. casue i know this wouldnt really fly if the cops didnt let these guys get away with it. in my area the cops would have arrested in you and good chance you would be forgot about in solimtary and it has happened in the area
0,The guy at the end just had to make it about race and be negative For all the other racists out there saying only a white person could do this Gavin seim the guy in this video is now a refuge in Mexico because the corrupt cops and judges tried to have him thrown into prison.
0,It's a learning lesson cops need more education on the law especially when they have to enforce the law
2,Is this freeman?
2,So you have evidence of personading a cop.
2,How Dafuq you supposed to uphold the law where you don’t even know it.
2,Washington state laws have different regulations for marked and unmarked vehicles.  Marked patrol vehicles are subject rules for decals and markings. Unmarked vehicles are not subject to the same rules. Just because the officer wasn't aware of the law doesn't mean the citizen was correct about the interpretation.
2,I'm wondering how the guy got the cop to pull over! I'm surprised the cop didn't just flip him off and speed off lol.
0,"If the guy who stopped the cop had been black, he'd be dead now."
2,Why’d he feel the need to add the whole extra part about “if it was a black guy” like wtf
2,This is America 🇺🇸...GOOD CITIZEN .BUT DON'T TRY AGAIN
0,God damn can this man be in a leadership position to keep cops in check. Beautiful
2,This cops maybe an impostor who knows -  this very informative and educational put an awareness to all citizen.
2,"I agree with Jayar. Here in the UK one of our most famous Olympians - a household name - got pulled in a nice car and asked where he stole it… I’m white & educated and have been arrested once, when much younger, and refused to sign a statement written by the arresting officer because it was equivocal - I got a blank look back and told him to find a senior officer and a dictionary. I deserved a smack really, but I absolutely know that if I’d been less well educated I’d have signed the statement and ended up in trouble, and can’t imagine what kind of hell I’d have landed in had I been anything other that white & middle class. 
We’re so lucky here that the police are not routinely armed, but we still have accidents… famously a Brazilian tourist was shot in the Underground and a man carrying a table leg under a blanket(?) but that’s all that I remember in a few decades…"
2,God created the true biblical flat earth 6000yrs ago as the scriptures clearly teach.
0,"We need more videos of people harassing cops. Since they wanna harass everybody,we all need to harass them for the same bullshits they pull on us"
0,"Police Departments know this isn't allowed.  They still do it because...
1. They know most people aren't aware of the law on unmarked cars.
2.  They don't think anyone will have the balls to call them out on it.
3.   Nothing will happen if they do.
Their priorities are to generate revenue even at the cost of public safety."
2,"that Gavin was awesome, not an ""average citizen"" at all! just wow! thanks for bringing this story.
oh, annoyed when allies help? really? this incident totally teaches about the two americas!"
2,"Gary needs to get a life. We need to hold cops accountable but harassing cops is not appropriate.  Gary could've called the sheriff's dept and spoke with a supervisor, instead of harassing the cop. As a former cop, my daily thoughts included not reacting badly to these idiots and jeopardize my retirement."
2,That was awesome! That Washington law needs to be adopted in every US state. It's a safety issue.
2,"Click bait, race baiting rubbish. Couldn't help yourselves could you?"
0,"Further demonstrates the point that you are respected and heard if you are a white male. Any other gender or color and you’re sent the mental institution, to jail, or worse. If a white male can take this action without any risk AND be taken seriously AND be for it then why not the rest of us?"
2,"This officer is a model officer.
We need more officers like him.💚"
2,"Great video but im happy the cameraman didn't pull over that ""one cop"".. cuz things could have ended differently..."
0,"An African American would never be able to get away with that, it's likely he wouldn't even be allowed near the car at gunpoint.
J Rs right, two Americas."
2,"Wow this happened in my state!? I hope this goes nationwide. And in our state it would have gone against the cop if he would have tried to protest. Also as a woman this how we've wound up raped or worse.
Looked up this guy. He is currently a fugitive from justice because it tried to interfere with a trial in Washington state by acting as the defendents attorney despite not having a law license.  He and his wife have fled to Mexico where our ambassador says he is behaving like a spoiled brat because he picks and chooses what laws of theirs he will obey. He insists their cops speak to him in English, he won't observe their Covid19 rules because he doesn't believe in Covid19. Oh yeah he believes in conspiracy theories and is a Libertarian."
2,Please can you look at a recent published VIDEO on a drug called IVERMECTIN
2,I love white ppl who use there privilege for shit like this 🤣🤣🤣
2,"I'm proud to say i did something similar. I followed a speeding canine unit concerned that it was driving erratically and posing a  danger to other motorists without any lights blaring, and he finally pulled over. A young cop emerged and looked at my ID and asked me why i was following him. I said, ""you were going 100 and cutting people off with no lights."" I also said, ""You are the worst driver i've ever seen."" He let me go and as far as i could see he drove more carefully after that."
0,This was a great video. I like how this gentleman questioned the officer with a very strong knowledge of the use of unmarked vehicles. This is actually how a actual cop should approach a vehicle. They should walk up and say “do you know why I pulled you over” without drawn gun. Then they explain why. This doesn’t happen in the videos I have seen with violence. The cops assume you are a criminal and don’t tell the person what they have or may have done. It’s your a criminal and I am judging you.
2,This law was passed in 1990 so why have the officers never been taught nor charged with any kind off offence as it happens a lot!
2,0:42 Why do f always try to socialize. I’m a liberal. I don’t want to hear about your fake sky daddy. Seriously if you’re a Christian please go get shot in an illegal war or something
2,"Wow if there so offended why go there…
And What the hell was the girlfriend-wearing ….! 
someone didn’t like it…..so he goes and harass young girls 
Such a Godly person…"
0,"Dear American right, the handmaids tale wasn't an instruction manual..."
0,"Right wingers talk MAD shit about Muslim countries and their Sharia laws but how is that much different from our harsh abortion laws and nut jobs like this that support oppresion of women (and the nut jobs in legislative positions who think the same)? BET he voted Trump cuase ""god"" whispered sweet nothings in his ear. FOH with your bullshit. Stay your stupid ass at home if you dont wanna see what offends your delicate beliefs. Swear these types of shit stains are the definition of snowflakes"

2,Christian Burka? Next the ban of the abortion?! Oh wait....
2,The American Taliban
2,"There are church goers who might have thoughts towards the way people live their lives, but they keep it to themselves. They understand, their feelings are a matter for God to judge them on. Then there are bible basher's who go out of their way to judge people openly on things like dress sense. Logan is the bible basher. If someone like him approaches you, just sit there and ignore him. Keep chatting to those you went to the venue with, or if you are alone & have a radio, turn it on & drown them out. (Make sure you only take a cheap radio to the beach. One you can afford to lose, in case they attempt to destroy it.)"
1,"Literally had to skip his video, I can’t take anymore of this push my Christianity on everyone bullshit!"
2,Afghanistan....Go Back Home!.A hole.
2,Got to love god boy saying we have a free will in this country then immediately goes to tell them what to do
0,He wasn't from Colorado. The women were. He moved here. Colorado rocks but the talibangelicals invade like a virus.
0,"The problem is that we have this sickening religion all over governments in the world. While the middle east is completely taken over by it again, the USA walks back to christianity too. It gets worse and worse. I am so annoyed that we cant move on from this garbage."
2,If the creator of life and master of the universe wanted us to follow a set of rules or guidelines on how we should live our lives then why speak in parables that only cause confusion and are subject to each person’s interpretation of what those words mean?  When you really think about it religious beliefs and any form of extremist beliefs don’t bring about a peaceful coexistence with other people.
2,"gosh, all the Taliban jokes became so real with that last clip. That man wants to hold all women responsible for his own weaknesses. 
I know adulting is hard, but if you want freedom, you have to learn to be responsible....jeez"
2,So young girls in bikinis 👙 👙 at the beach triggered your porn addiction. So to satisfy your self-serving perversion you approached these young women under the guise of Christ. Then because your fiance had on that wack a$$ Wonder Woman outfit you're mad? Allegedly! The only difference between them and his fiance is her bottoms. But she is showing her skins none the less. You girls should be ashamed of yourselves making him go home and watch porn😂😂😂
2,"The body,  in shape, is beautiful, so people will look.  But what was ponographic?  How about those women with everything exposed and ask you, what are you looking at?"
0,Typical religious jerk
0,"USA has so much religios scam, make video about that not about some true stupid believer. Making fun of stupid honest well meaning people is so much worse then his idiotic speach. Stop this Karen bullshit clickbait, do something better with TYT then farming clicks. Religion in USA is such f...up (Abortion for example) leave simple people alone focus on the scam artists behind that make millions of this poor true believers. You deviding your country instead of putting things together."
2,Atheist explains a lot lol…dude has a point but it’s worthless to even  approach people with statements like that cuz at the end of the day people don’t give af what you
2,"Hey Ana... I'm a Christian,  but I still agree with you... F**k that ""male Karen"". I 'flip the bird' on occasion, and swear WAY TO OFTEN. He's a jackass."
2,Was this near Colorado Springs? Lots of hard-core Christians around there.
2,"How does someone who has full sleeve tattoos have the balls to tell others that they cannot find worth in their body?  Especially when he wears a shirt that specifically shows off those tattoos.  Oh right, because the whole argument is bullshit.  Another attempt to remove body autonomy.  You can't show skin because I am not capable of teaching my children restraint.  Hope you enjoy your internet fame, and that your boss sees these videos."
2,Your kids are going to hate women now. Good parenting.
2,"When Jesus addressed men with lustful eyes, he didn't tell women to change their clothes, he told the men to gouge their eyes out."
0,This is the Christian Taliban… this is what a lot of people actually want to enforce their beliefs on you. It’s always best to keep your mouth shut and mind your own business.
0,"Smdreads.... Im so sick of these self righteous, hypocritical bible thumping weirdos..... 😒😒😒"
2,Christians are so jealous of the taliban.
2,"He is probably a sexual abuser. Check his computer, iPad and cell phone!"
2,"I'd have told him that God created Adam and Eve naked and the beach provides us with an opportunity to get closer to our original state in Paradise. This guys previous job in his previous life was handing out fig leaf's in the Garden of Eden. I'd have called up a photo on my phone of Michaelangelo's Sistine Chapel frescoes as soon as he invoked the name of God. For devout Michaelangelo, the purest expression of divinity is found in the perfection of the naked human form. Unfortunately, the leaders of the Catholic Church were even more uptight about nudity than this guy: they commissioned other artists to paint clothes over the original figures nudity."
2,"When I was a kid some gigantically fat, gross woman told me I had to leave a public pool because I was upsetting young children because of my leg (I am an amputee). She even put her hands on me to physically force me to leave the pool area, at which point the life guards (and letter the police) got involved. 
     Never mind that I had every right to use the pool and had paid to be there.
     Also, I have been an amputee for 48 years now (since I was 3) and yea, little kids are sometimes scared, but mostly they are curious. If I can talk to them (always with parents permission) they stop being scared right away.
     When I worked at a resort I was swimming laps on my day off when I saw a little girl, about 4 with my fake leg trying to give it to her terrified looking dad.
    The kid was German and was trying to tell her dad, ""Daddy, someone for got their leg. You need to find them and give it back before they fall over.""
    Dad was thinking, ""Oh god, my kid has found someone's prosthetic leg and is playing with it. What should I say if the owner sees this?""
    Well his nightmare had come true. The owner had seen it, but thought it was hella funny.
    Though the child spoke only German, and I spoke only English the father, once he realized I was not upset was happy to translate.
     I was able to tell the child about my leg through her father. The kid was extremely sweet. After I explained about my leg and got her to put it back, she said something and patted my head (I was in the pool at this point) that caused her dad to laugh. She had said, ""You poor man. Not only is your leg gone, you can't even talk.""
     I have a huge amount of experience with children. It doesn't hurt them to see disabled people."
2,I spoke to fast...I WAS RIGHT ABOUT HIM and why he had a issue with these women. lol
0,Christians showing solidarity with the taliban like they've always done. They just hate that there are muslims coming here that aren't being as subjugating to women
2,So glad these girls were atheists. Smart
0,I thought the girls were really sweet in the way they handled being accosted like that.  Laughing and asking politely to be left alone. There were several guys in the background without shirts on.  These religious fools were just ridiculous.
2,"This happy clapper made a complete fool of himself, religion is like having a penis it’s all well and good to have one
But when you get it out and start showing people it can be quite offensive."
2,Jesus christ if he loves God that much  and wants to control women tell him to f off to Afghanistan or Texas
2,"I'm not saying these so called Christian's don't read the scriptures, but I think they're changing the meanings round to suit their purpose."
2,"America is absolutely FULL of entitled a**holes. The irony is that guys like that think Everyone ELSE is entitled, lol."
2,"You decided to breed! Why should I have to conform for the choices you made!! Dude, You’re Christian? Are you the father of said child? Sex before marriage? God said? The bible was written by god? Sit down perv"
2,"A bikini does not equate to porn😳 I think the issue might be that he was never introduced to a good PHSE (personal health and sexual education) class in school that included an appropriate discussion about emotional health , boundaries and social interaction."
0,It's always the religinuts. I'm glad religion has been on a gradual decline in the West for the past 30 years. These clowns can't disappear soon enough.
2,What a pervert
0,The American Taliban is on the rise.
2,He is obviously Taliban...
2,"They should have said, ""Actually, we're Satanists and we were sent here to tempt you.  Clearly, it's working."" Then laugh insanely!"
2,"He lucky this wasn't in Texas..
The governor would have rolled up on him."
2,Something tells me he was thinking disgusting things and couldn't handle it so he took his frustration out on the women.... Don't like how people dress at a PUBLIC beach with no dress code then buy a pool and enforce a dress code at YOUR pool... FOH
2,Looks like everything Margaret Atwood wrote about in The Handmaids Tale is coming true.  Gilead is starting to take shape nicely in the USA especially with idiots like him giving everyone his opinion.
2,"His deity ""creates"" people in its own image, fashions them naked, sends every single one of them into the world naked, kicked them out of paradise for putting clothes on...  Yet this guy thinks there's something wrong with the human body.  Gotta love the logic."
0,"The kids will be exposed to this kind of thing whether you don't like it or not..and all I heard from this Bozo is Blah, Blah, I'm gonna force my religion onto you, Blah, Blah...and 1 more thing, he has a fiancée but already have a son daughter?..thought Christianity said no fornicating B4 marriage..soo..how's that working again"
2,"I do believe in God, but I don't believe in judging others. ""Let he who is without sin, cast the 1st stone."" That verse was to do with a prostitute. Because of her sins, a group of men were going to throw stones at her. Jesus basically said, if you haven't done ANYTHING wrong in your life, then you can cast a stone at her. But each one dropped their stone & walked away. I would like to see if other women down the beach, were dressed the same way as the girls, and if he reacted to same way to them."
1,he was not saying all for ivermectin   he was talking about his entire treatment  it got him better     TYT  spreads misinformation by saying Trump was working with putin for four years
1,The vaccine doesn’t work you can catch it and past it.. let this shit run its course.
1,"he never claimed that ivermectin is the ONLY thing that cured him......   the bottom line is, it wasn't the vaccine that cured him, obviously.......   TYT and CNN accusing someone from spreading misinformation is the MOUNT EVEREST of irony :D:D:D"
2,Segura in the interview tells joe that  he got the vaccine because his cousin who is infectious diseases expert admitted to him is the best choice then rogan does a stink face.
2,he would sue tyt but they have no money.
2,He was talking about suing CNN because they were saying he was taking the drug used on horse's not the one prescripted to humans.
2,"Dr Andrew Hill's post may have been referring to a ""study"" published by the Front Line Medical Care Alliance. Earlier this week, a judge prevented Dr Wagshul, the guy who runs that shit-show, from prescribing Ivermectin to a Covid patient."
2,Ana is triggered that Joe never invites her or any of the tyt clowns on his podcast. Big suprise nobody likes moronic SJWs
2,"He's making a questionable cause lagical fallacy, he is using correlation and implying causation, when some people don't even get symptoms from the virus that's some fairly sloppy thinking."
1,"Please don’t wear masks, please don’t take the vaccination, please take animal medicine and anything else you want. THANOS."
0,Ivermectin is perfect for Republicans. It is an anti-parasitic.
2,Joe Organ sure took a lot of drugs for a disease that “isn’t that harmful”
0,"I think it would be helpful if we had a list of drugs that are actually being used by medical professionals to treat covid-19 patients and drugs that charlatans are pushing as treatments for covid-19. Education on this is important, otherwise grifters will continue to grift those who are gullible"
0,"To answer why people will pay for medicine that isn't proven to work instead of taking the vaccine for free is because there is a saying.  ""A fool and their money will soon part"""
1,I'm unsubscribing from tyt due to finally seeing that they will spew left wing talking points blinding .. do your own research about ivermectin.. just to add I'm all for democratic progression
2,I used being vaccinated. That and garlic. Hmm... it looks like I am fine without Ivermectin. Joe Rogan is just some punk who got lucky and survived. Wait until next strain. We will see if he survives that round.
1,Ana is better then Joe. Much better. Joe is garbage.
2,why don't everybody have access to monoclonal antibodies? What's the reason? Are there people who are more important than others?
2,Joe Rogan living proof that comedians are not philosophers and you don't have to be smart to be funny
2,I have watched this pandemic since in began and doctors have said how it tricks people because they naturally get better for a couple of days and then they go down hill fast.......Has Rogan been 'well' for sometime now or only a couple of days?
2,"Please Ana, by all means go talk to him on his show line Cenk did. Engage in a healthy disagreement that may educate how both sides think about it. You debated Tomi Lahren. Why not just be a guest? Not a bad idea for some attention to both points of view."
2,"I listened to a couple episodes of Joe Rogan's podcast a couple months ago while at work. Wanted to see what all the hype around this guy was. I really only knew him from the sitcom ""Newsradio"" and ""Fear Factor"", time killers on NBC back in the day. So I listened, and his interviews where serviceable, and he had no great insight into anything with his commentary. Like most of his show was pleasant enough background, but the level his listeners think he's so smart and the $100 million dollar is baffling. Like he wasn't even a good entertainer really. Like Rush Limbaugh was a horrible man, but his show could be entertaining, and he was a brilliant broadcaster, if not a great commentator who would often say horrific things. However he could stretch nothing into hours of content. Rogan doesn't even have that going for him. So, basically, I don't get this guy at all. However, on a larger scale, he has gotten dangerous and Spotify needs to pull his contract."
1,Joe is endlessly disappointing and really chosen to go down the path of the rightwing grifter in order to make even more money than he already has...
2,Was he vaccinated
2,"Either way he got better WITHOUT THE VACCINE !!!............And weren't they telling people that antibiotics just don't work at all in the beginning ??? So, there's no need in even thinking about taking'em.... They were suppressing and bad mouthing  just about everything(even vitamins ) last year that was Not a wearing a mask or waiting for vaccine ...."
2,You guys all thought that Joe would die and were rooting for it because it would fit your narrative of “vaccines for everyone”. You were wrong. Vaccines are only for those with comorbidities. He got over this virus in ONE day with no vaccine. Lol.
2,Rogan is such an impressionable baby. At this point it seems malicious or it's because he is self-selecting the only doctors who agree with this Ivermectin BS. Data is out there. Read it or shut up
1,"Look up, ""EXPOSED! FDA, CDC WHO is hiding this from you."""
0,"Joe Rogan has got many deaths on his hands. What's he going to do now, sue for ""defamation""? :-)"
2,"His doctor advised him to take it you nimwats, crazy how TYT's content is aligned with CNN's, MSNBC etc, watch the video his doctor advised him, it helped him. he never told people to take it"
2,"I think the other point is, he is constantly claiming that people like him with no comorbidities  and are healthy are fine. 

So why does he need intervention?  It’s just a cold isn’t it? 

He accidentally shown that deep, deep down, he doesn’t believe it."
2,"I mean people can try to use  Ivermectin for covid. And if it doesn't work, they can curse joe rogan on their deathbed lol"
2,Guess ana and cenk won't be on his show anytime soon
2,"Z pac, the antibiotic, will do absolutely nothing against a virus. 
REAL doctor’s are actually strongly against prescribing antibiotics for anything other than a bacterial infection, because it can cause antibiotic resistance when used when it’s not needed. 
Yeah, way to go Joe, treat a viral infection with an antibiotic. 
Idiot. 😵‍💫"
1,tYt is the most stupid online political content creator rip tyt
0,If there is a virus in the future that is a 100% death rate we are screwed even with a vaccine because people will still be stupid.
1,"Simple !!!! They don't trust the government or TYT, CNN & all the usual propaganda suspects. Maybe because they have all lied about so much all ready !!!"
2,"I have been calling out Kulinski and Talking Points for not calling out ""their boy"". I just saw Saagar back the fool up! ""F**k MSM!""? If they won't call Rogan out, who will?! ""Duh, Duh, it was a duh"". I used to give Kulinski some creditability but the ""synergy"" between him and Talking 'Pints' idiocy has me wondering."
2,"The real problem with Ivermectin is that it only cost about 2 cents a pill…
along with vitamin D (study after study has shown the lower your vitamin D status the harder this virus hits you) there is simply no money to be made.
Shame on you TYT for not doing your job as journalists and buying into the world of big pharma
the WHO says Ivermectin is one of the safest drugs on the planet and could easily be given out to people waiting for a vaccine…the problem is tho if you give people cheap drugs and they get the virus and don't get that sick, they might feel like they don’t need the vaccine…only money to lose if you promote something cheap, even if it “helps”
You say that there are no studies…let me ask you this, if you were sick how ethical would it be to withhold a medication that might save your life? Would you participate in such a study?

"
2,"WHERE WILL YOU GO WHEN YOU DIE? 

What day will it happen? Today? Tomorrow? 

One hundred and fifty thousand people die every day. How many of them were ready?

When you stand before God on that day will you go to heaven or hell? 

Jesus Christ tells us that unless you’re born again you will not see the kingdom of God. You will be judged for your sins; all of the lies, the immoral thoughts, stealing, blaspheming and justly sentenced to hell.

But you don’t have to go to hell. Jesus Christ tells us that whosoever repents of their sins and trusts in him can be saved. Jesus paid the penalty of your sins on the cross at Calvary two thousands years ago. 

What sin is worth an eternity in hell? Think how precious your eyes are to you, what would it take to sell your eyes? And how much for valuable the soul that looks out of those eyes? Don’t go to hell, repent and trust in Jesus and be saved."
2,"Z-pac is some dangerous s***! Doctors don't clue you in on this, wipes out your body's microbiome, causes liver damage, way too strong of an antibiotic!"
0,"I called this. I knew Rogan would fail to mention that he also received Regeneron's monoclonal antibodies treatment which is between $1200 and $1500 per shot, Z-pack antibiotics, a vitamin drip, and still hasn't answered whether he's gotten vaccinated. Seems Mr anti-media propaganda, is himself a propagandist. F**k Joe Rogan."
2,Why do people not listen to scientists and consensus? Does Joe even bring reputable doctors on his show anymore?
0,"Know what’s super ironic? The same people who refuse the vaccine because they don’t know what’s in it or understand how it works are scared of the side effects are the same people who gladly seek out and take ivermectin without any clue how it works, what is in it, or what the side effects and possible risks are 🤣 AND they’ll cite the study that has since been retracted due to medical fraud as the holy grail of reasons to take ivermectin, yet purposely ignore alllllllll the actual legitimate data proving the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Takes a special kind of stupid. And the sad (and scary!) part is our world is full of em…"
0,"Have we been watching the same Joe Rogan? I have no idea how anyone could have ever thought that he had more than perhaps an eighth of a brain. He has never asked an intelligent question on his show. He just asks his stupid questions in an engaging way, and makes it painfully obvious that he doesn't understand why his controversial guests are controversial. Then his smart guests are just good at taking his stupid questions and giving interesting responses, anyway. He has ALWAYS been the Donald Trump of interviews. He just leverages his confidence and name recognition to convince unknowledgeable people that he is competent and get them to follow him through a kind of unfounded hero worship."
2,"For all of you who wished a person like Rogan and Trump a speedy recovery, I sure hope you’re all happy. 😐🤨"
2,"I don’t know ,  should I believe Anna or doctor Pierre Kory (a well known critical care physician ) who with his team treated  hundreds or even thousands covid patients using ivermectin and other medications ."
2,Joe Rogan is a moron. It’s scary how many followers he has when the guy can barely have a coherent thought. 🤦🏻‍♂️
2,"It's not intelligence thats in play here. First, JR has always been into anti gov conspiracy, and second It's about the attention grabbing. He has became another ""professional idiot"" making whatever statements that will bring in the $. His show should come with disclaimer."
2,Joe Rogan suppose expert saw a way to make money on covid so he decided to go that way and Rogan talk about big pharma reasons. He got lied to and he does not even know it.
2,Take care TYT !! Jo is suing CNN & only right. TYT next !!!
2,I'm sure it was the horse meds and not all the other shit he took that was actually proper meds for covid. lol
2,I would of been a little more on board with the ivermectin claim until he mentioned the doctor who prescribed it. I forget the name of the group the doctor is part of I think it's Frontline c19 doctors or some crap but the get major kick backs. Doctors can be bad people too.
2,If you listened to his podcast you might have heard him say he already had his medical treatment in place if he caught covid. That wasn't panicking. As for the vaccine it is not a cure all. Evidence now points to it offsetting the worst effects of covid but you will need a booster 6 months after your second vaccination given it is now proven that it's efficacy drops to 40% after that initial period
2,Lol why you piss off at him for his own opinion. His body his choice . Not like your beloved vaccine does anything to treat the virus. In fact the virus is not even deadly enough to spend this much effort to deal with.
0,"no worries, let him continue to spead the mis-information and more anti-maskers and anti-vaccine retards die, these retards are just wasting earth's resources, their deaths is the only good they will ever contribute to society."
2,I'm no fan of this abortion law. But this is concerning that parts of the country are officially deciding to effectively put sanctions on other parts of the US. I barely even like it when we sanction foreign countries ffs.
2,"I THINK THESE CONCERNED TEXAS CITIZENS SHOULD PAY FOR THE CARE & UPBRINGING OF SAID UNWANTED CHILDREN.
OH YA,THATS WHAT FOSTER CARE DOES.BUT THAT METHOD OF CARE DOES NOT SEEM TO CHURN OUT ANY REAL LAW ABIDING CITIZENS."
1,this just another left wing rubbish
2,Pretty sure Texans don’t care one iota about Portland or their politics...
2,Even though Texas ranks is the number ninth it slowly catching up to California because California is starting to feel the pinch of the pandemic since California lives off of borrowed money it's not really going to last long for the state which is why so many Californians left California for Texas. I don't like this reference but they called Texas the Western version of China in the US. I doubt the state would even notice Portland at all.
1,This is 100% political theatre.  Ted Wheeler is universally hated by progressives in Portland and he knows it.
2,I have been married in two states. Texas and Indiana. On both my marriage applications there is a question that ass are you at least second cousins? That is an actual question on the application. When I asked about it I was told it’s a old law that you have to be at least second cousins to be married in Texas. I seen the same question on my Indiana marriage license application.
2,"Lotta sad little trolls out these days, eh? Poor little guys. They have nothing of substance, especially a legitimate ideology, and resort to wasting their time trolling a left leaning podcast. I'd suggest maybe pick up a real hobby or start drinking or something."
1,"Wheeler is such a dork he should be a regular on the Young Turds. Portland City employees are being made to get vaccinated , but yet he still clings to ""my body my choice""! What about that little babies choice? Oh wait it can't vote."
2,"TYT wants to legalize heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine, but wants Vaccine mandates, wants to legalize abortion, and legalize transgenders using  women's bathrooms. Their medical IDEOLOGIES are all over the place."
1,I live in Portland and this is just performative. Today Wheeler said the police don't have to comply with city employees vaccine mandate after the police union threatened to quit. He's totally ineffective. People are trying to recall him.
2,".  Just because the people in Texas want to give the majority of women want they want.
How is that bad?"
0,"Lol. I’ve been boycotting TX my entire life. We can boycott every red state, because their main industry is welfare and disability."

2,Companies should start boycotting left & right.
2,"By the same ""logic,"" Texas doesn't need to let everyone carry a gun without a permit---they can just take all robbers and murderers off the streets."
0,Suppose a man rapes a woman and gets her pregnant. She then gets an abortion. According to Texas law the woman getting the abortion is now a bigger criminal than the man who raped her
2,The federal government should take NASA and the Fort Hood military base out of Texas and put them in another state. I'm sure Texans will support this as they hate big government.
0,"Just like MLK and X said and Showed boycott Jim Crow states. Bankrupt them,move,don't visit them,don't order anything online from the states"
2,Republicans must love mask mandates if they think outlawing abortions is a good idea. Government should be in charge of your body right?

2,Boycotting Texas is just stupid.
0,"Someone should start a non-profit outside Texas that will help these women get out of Texas or at the very least get their care outside of Texas. I would donate money to such an organization in a heartbeat (no pun intended).

Update: It just occurred to me that I am a member of the Humanist Society, albeit very passive as I almost never even attend local meetings, but this has got riled up enough I am going reach out to an active member I know and see if I can get him to put the word out to look for someone active enough to do this. I bet if we can find someone in Portland that they would fast-track a non-profit getting setup legally there."

But black people in the UK who were former slaves were not given anything..."

He never said slave owners DESERVE reparations. He said - as a matter of factual, observable reality - that any talk about reparations will inevitably lead to a conversation about giving reparations to slave owners. 
TYT is so shameful & simplistic. They'll vilify anything that makes them think outside of their banal framework"
0,Why the legislature in CA don't rewrite there laws to discourage frivolous recalls to circumvent an election is beyond me.

0,Every time when I see videos like this I am reminded of that Dave Chapell skit about a black-white supremacist and Kanye West's completely idiotic statement about slavery and I ask myself are these morons for real or are they doing this as a grift. Where ever their reasons are people like Larry Elder prove you don't have to be White to be a White Supremacist. You just have to agree with their fascist ideologies and policies if that means you'll rake in millions of dollars in serving and submitting to the White Elites and White Supremacists of this country who have systematically and purposefully oppressed people of color since the Spanish and the Puritans first landing on this continent.
2,Elder is right but the way he puts it is wrong. But stating that he says slave owners DESERVE reparation's is not what he said. Both sides are going way too far in battling each other when divided we fall.
2,This is the one time Cenk spoke truth. The slavery mentioned acts…. They seem to forget and glee over. Thumbs up on the vid!

2,Did he do the reparations. Does telling a fact mean he condones it. Does white racists invented planned parenthood to thin out the freed black race mean Democrats still hate blacks who don't vote for them anymore.
2,Professor Tony Martin has done the most in depth research on who exactly dominated the slave trade.
2,"Slave owners deserve reparations?!!!. This man wants black people to support him? He will never be governor of California, not even the devil can help him."
2,He literally just said they got paid? No one would think he just made a point unless they wanted their racist ideology confirmed
2,Candace isn’t African American so I see why she would sell out. But shame shame shame on Larry elder. That’s quite embarrassing on his part and on behalf of Black Republicans

Commander in Chief change our country does not change it grows and the growth. has got to be strong and positive. Schooled I don't see any reason why they can't be open if we have school choice then parents can decide what school they will go to or if they will be homeschooled but now they can get online K through 12, you can also get a college degree by studying and being educated through your computer connected to a college and get your degree you don't have to sit in a classroom to learn anymore it's nice to have the, interaction of classmate and a teacher or instructor to answer questions to put things in perspective. I could see students doing most of their studies online and once or twice a week actually face-to-face with an instructor teacher that can go through their material with them do any explanations that I needed help them with any corrections that are needed it's a simple thing nobody has to make this such a big deal. All we have to do is vote America first and there's only one way to go for that and it's Donald Trump the man who wrote The Art of the deal nobody can do better than him he's the master of the deal and that's what our country needs a strong force but never got down that has a good view of the future and what it could be like one way or the other and I'm all for the one way Donald Trump.

Is our President's plans to win besides the good job he's doing good enough? What I'm referring is not twilight zone, the left is desperate and with a lot of money and many of them. We must secure the white house and Senate, there's enemies even in our military, what can we do to keep our country? Something to think about it seriously.."
1,So why is fox making such a big deal of so called  pointless polls when did you join the Biden team.

2,"From my up-here-Canadian- perspective all democrat-promising polls and slogans and statements promising Trump-demise by their mediapuppets sounds pretty fabulous to me... 
the more they smear Trump, the more they denigrate the silent censored populace, and the more they invent Trump-down- polls the more likely Trump will be on a roll for another four years -

2,July of 2020 and the MSM is still at it with the poll numbers. Amazing.
1,"I don't trust any of these elected official polls. 
  No matter who does it it's biased. 
   Only idiots vote on them things anyways. 
   I'm going to vote for trump 2020. 
  I get ads for polls through his campaign all the time. 
   I never vote on them. 

   If you send out a poll to a group of ppl who approve of you, then the results are irrelevant. 
  That's what most if not all of these polls are always anyways. 
   A poll they sent out to ppl that they already know like them. 
   Or they only poll a select group of ppl. 
  A poll that they or ppl that support them paid for or conducted. Etc.

   It's hilarious. It means absolutely nothing. 
  Most ppl who are actually going to vote, don't waste their time with meaningless polls. 
   It shouldn't even be a topic of conversation."
1,Run to the shelter. The senile Biden is the ideal man to trust with the nuclear button.
1,I pay no mind to fake polls and fake news. Trump will win BIG in November! FOUR MORE YEARS!!! TRUMP2020

2,If people want to leave they have to have a place to go and interestingly enough most countries have much tougher entery standards than America. If you have. D.U.I. you can't enter Canada. A train engineer was stopped and the train sat there until he was replaced and given a different route.

1,intellect and common sense has nothing to do with color. Voting because of color as the number one reason for voting is stupid.Unless of course you are a corporate head and the person of color even though they can't lead as Kamala is no leader would vote for her if she took lobby money from their corporation in return for immense income returns. Thats a reason why they get bailed out instead of the small mom and pop stores.They can't buy prosperity or freedom like corporations do.
0,Tucker Carlson …….. did you formerly work for the National Enquirer? Your supposed commentary sure sounds like it.  Fox News aka Propaganda News
2,"You know... when I was a kid I thought clowns were pretty cool... but I grew up... why won't these people in the media? oh yeah... and a complete lack of objectivity... I forgot :)

On the subject of the star spangled banner... The United States should not be waving any other flag. Nothing is a bigger display of U.S strength and unity than a flag that represents you all, regardless of the hue of your epidermis, political ideology or religion... and given the current state of affairs, it would be advisable to at least appear united to onlookers... even if it's not currently true.

As someone who lives in an U.S allied nation, it doesn't do our confidence well to see demonstrations of our allies political strife being played out in the open for all to see... it may embolden some... and that will not end well for any of us :( Please... get it together and soon."
2,"This is the sad truth about our country but it seems as though it's a popularity  contest. We need to teach our kids to use their heads , look things up for themselves know what your talking about and don't get behinds someone just based on them being liked. Fact check them . Vote for people who are qualified to do these jobs and have been for years"

1,Kamala sucked her way into office. Period.
0,"It's a sad reality.  Most if not all of the world hate America.  That's before the Afgan retreat.  What is even sadder is most Americans think they are still some kind of world leader.  Apart from the fine military, the US has nothing legitimate to say to the rest of the world."
1,A Demi-god of the underworld… more like THE JOKER…

WHAT A PAIR THEY ARE.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GOD BLESS US FROM THEM.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Demi-gurd?
1,"Kamala is even an even more radical anti-American than Biden, so I'm afraid if Biden does get impeached, will have just gone from the frying pan to the fire, and then there's Pelosi, so God help us all with this triangle of evil ruling our nation."
2,Kamala Disney is controlled by CCP as is most of Hollywood Where is US culture and ideal's gone or controlled by whom ? CCP & Disney CHANGE DNA & COULOUR at will Make believe is great on screen don't work well in real life

1,It’s not an accomplishment when you are hand picked solely based on  your race and gender. She is the ultimate example of virtue signalling.
1,Inpeach her she is so fake just like sleepy joe is they are America's major problem
2,Obama was just as unknown am unchecked an nobody cared
2,"She even said she listened to Biggie, and Tupac in college. What is up with Democrats and dead people!! Dead people who cannot vote, cannot sing, nor make decisions for themselves. lol"
2,USA is finished.
2,"0. K. Let's admit it. George Dubya's war on terror has been an enormous waste of time, human suffering, and money. $3.000.000 a day for the last twenty years, according to some reports. Now, there are more homegrown terrorists in America than it's possible to shake a stick at. Think what Bin Laden would have felt if his supporters could have achieved the same as Trump's on 21."
2,"Isn't she?!
She's the first president of the United States that never runned to be president.

Or do you think that Biden rules anything?"

2,Maybe she's a science experiment going bad in the refrigerator of the   White House. 🤨
2,Give her a gag and tell her to step down along with looney political partner in charge.  Both are a disgrace and embarrassment to this country. Neither one of them are capable of doing the most important job in this country... PROTECT AND SUPPORT the people that pay their salaries... WE THE PEOPLE.
1,"Sounds like they are turning Kamala Harris into Princess Diana. 

America has no thought what she will do. Because she is a pawn of the right color, but does not have the ability to think on her feet. 

If you asked me, all this time we’ve been told that White people are systemically racist. On the contrary. White people really aren’t but the people of color will vote for someone who is there color despite that the one most of note was a RED DIAPER BABY!"
2,"As a Guatemalan, i assure you, the of a vice president is last thing ppl are focused on in a 3rd world country like Guatemala..that silly mindset doesn't exist there..survival is the mindset there...plus,Barack obama is the 1st black PRESIDENT..so a asian female VICE PRESIDENT isn't a game changer,..everyone wants to be the ""first"", everyone wants to be an icon..smh.."
1,"It is sad that the first ""woman vice president"" that is  OF COLOR, make sure to get THAT right btw, is this cackling hyena disgrace that's apart of an even more disgraceful administration that consistanly shows the absolute downgrade of our American government."
1,"I'd say it's a good time for Trump to demand the reins be handed back over to him since they were illegally & fraudulently withheld from him, for all this time anyway."

1,Does AOC know...anything?
2,How many idiots does it take to elect her? Just amazing.
2,Parents making a bad choice to come here illegally
2,Go to the statue of liberty
2,AOC is a Box of Rocks!
2,Glad to see the USA also has RAGA (Rahul Gandhi) kind of people 😂
1,"They, the liberal left, have no problem whatsoever removing a baby from a mother’s womb, all be it a full term or not, but yet they do supposedly have a problem with removing a child from a mother entering the border illegally. How upside down is that?"
2,She wouldn't anything now since they are taking away unvaxxed children from their unvaxxed parents. It's all nefarious political agenda in the of side bad to plummet the country of it's sovereign glory ordained from God.
1,AOC is the only waitress that can’t bring something to the table.
2,"someone give the woman her old job back, please 
All she was good at was knocking on doors and making big  promises.
Let it be a lesson to all in politics.
Any ignoramus can get elected into office if he knocked enough doors and promised big enough."
2,What kind of “family” separates themselves from their children??? I don’t understand this.  I know women here that have left their children behind in another country.  What mother does that? . I would NEVER leave my children behind
2,Seeking asylum? Go through a legal point of entry.
1,"AOC is a real credit to her worshippers, the American left 😂 both have no sense"
1,"AO-C want 200,000 Afganistan in the US. Let's put them in her districts, we will have an American Afgan representatives from that district, win win.  People cross the border, with no means of supporting their children or commit crimes are separated from their kids all the time."
2,"Homan is a rock star! He didn't budge, calmly explaining facts to a mentally challenged girl is playing congress woman! LOL."
2,"If this clown managed to get elected then now i truly beleive ' nothing is impossible """
1,How embarrassing for you AOC!!!!!!!
1,AOC your actually a Marxist....an Atheist and out of your mind!! Do your homework and stop putting the kids in danger and let illegal immigration happen..... you have done nothing to make things better.....you are bought and paid for!!!!!! This isn't something YOU have discovered!!!!!!!!
2,Who voted for this child.
1,This started when AOC and the rest of her screwed up party started recruiting foreigners to migrate to our borders and instructed them to break our laws!
1,"Kinda funny. The crisis at the border is 10 times worse now than it was then. Has anyone heard AOC whining lately about ""kids in cages?"" Yeah, I thought not. Hypocrites!!!!"
1,"People talk a bout the dangers of White supremacy but I see in AOC, the danger of Dumb supremacy."
1,AOC need to be removed from her position because she doesn't know anything and all she knows is how to read from a piece of paper smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
1,AOC the smartest dumb girl ever.
1,"Does she actually care about family separation and the family unit? Absolutely not. How can someone on the left support abortion and all the heinous school indoctrination (neither of which regard all human life as precious) and then make this argument? The Left is doing all they can to destroy the family unit and replace God with government. 
Pray for children and the future of our nation. 
-A Stay at Home Mom"
2,The children are with Coyote's not their Parents! Cartel's are making millions of dollars on these children it's a known fact!
2,How these people get elected is beyond me.  Why defend those that break the law???  😡😡
2,"I don't really like AOC, but damn, she is hot af 💯🔥"
2,How did she get here she has no idea what the laws are ? DA
1,"Its illegal so you can shoot them down right ?
They are illegal so you can seperate children from their parents....

There is something called proportionality in law and AOC is right... Most people are just racist and have no clue what they are talking about...."
1,"AOC lying again!
She is the most dishonest politician in Washington!"
1,"When AOC speaks, she can make a tree stump look like a genius."
2,"Pretty sad that we've got a child in Congress, I don't think she would remember to breathe if her brain didn't tell her to"
1,AOC is a child that needs to grow up. She’s all feelings.
2,I'm guessing there's not a great deal of familiarity with the Geneva Convention among commenters here.
2,So why then isn't it a crime when Joe Biden allows them to enter American territory by close to a million people by now?????
2,and people actually vote for that idiot?
2,"She has no idea how the system works. Seeking legal asylum still means you have to have permission to enter the country, otherwise you ILLEGALLY entered."
2,She makes us Puerto Ricans look bad! This woman has no place in politics but maybe a talk show with Oprah. 😕
1,"What a joke! Boy she tried to twist the narrative but he answered her with TRUTH and up holding the USAs laws upon entry into this country. You know something. Maybe some one has answer. Why do they (you know who “they” are) want to  become an American citizen, but WANT TO CHANGE EVERYTHING OUR COUNTRY STANDS FOR? God, family, country! 
Lee, Grant, Calhoun, Stonewall Jackson, the men still today in the Marines, Army, Air Force, Navy... who fought (fighting) to KEEP OUR FREEDOMS. 
Get your Bibles

1,Arrest the illegals period
1,"Humm let’s think , illegal boarder crossing , it in the name it’s a crime  “ illegal “. She claims to of gone to college , that seems questionable !"
2,"Why vote for this complete idiot and liar. They really like harming our country for their personal benefit. So disgusting, should be illegal."
2,AOC was about to cry LOL
2,Dump all those and divert all those illegal entry people to her home. She will be set 😜 once for all. Crazy lady.
1,Getting older is a given. Growing up is optional. Some people are happy to be juvenile all their life and AOC is a prime example.
2,these sort of hearing should be conducted here in India. let the people know who is the fool.
2,My daughter was took by the department of Job and family Services because I grew up in the system I had no drug habits or anything so if you want to fight for immigrants to keep their children but what about the Americans that lost our  children to the department of Job and family Services system
2,"This woman looks arrogant, not having any understanding of law and looks like she is not suitable for any government post either secretary of a department or as a government employee."
2,Wow AOC actually did some research for once but then she conveniently assumed 'illegally' also meant legally which is not what the document says.
1,A.O.C Talieb and Omar Should Be Locked Up In Prison For Treason Against The American People and Humanity
1,Does AOC   '' WAKE  UP ''  Or Not After This Hearing Or Is She Basically  '' LOST '' !!!!!
1,"AOC is a huge hypocrite because she advocates by her actions what she seeks to deny in her rhetoric. Like everything on the left, she lies very well about what she is actually doing."
2,This is a woman who graduated with honors in Economics and INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS!! Boston University has a lot to answer for.

1,"It upsets me that people see Fauci as the big savior, and he was the instigator and supervisor of the production of this virus."
2,The same with Climate Change.
1,The American public will pay the price for allowing this senile puppet and his masters to destroy the christian fabric of this nation. Destruction is coming America!
1,When injustice is law resistance is duty. Thomas Jefferson.  It's time to vote them out and stop this communist takeover that world leaders want to control.
1,"Fauci knows nothing, he's being controlled by demons, the W, H, O, Bill Gates,and the New World Order, he knows the vaccine is spreading the virus and killing people."
2,The doctors who go against politicians get silenced!! The media is the virus!!
2,It's time LORD. It's time. Cleanup the trash in America and the world.
2,Why are the homeless surviving with their poor health?
2,"If I die, and it was not COVID and they put down COVID, I am coming back to haunt so many people."
1,"The masks begin to fall off!
 ""The Chinese biological laboratory in Wuhan is owned by Glaxosmithkline,  which (accidentally) owns Pfizer!"" (the one who makes the vaccine against  the virus which was (accidentally) started at the Wuhan Biological Lab and  which was (accidentally) funded by Dr. Fauci, who (accidentally) promotes  the vaccine!  ""GlaxoSmithKline is (accidentally) managed by the finance division of Black  Rock, which (accidentally) manages the finances of the Open Borders Foundation (a Soros Foundation), which (accidentally) manages the French AXA!  George Soros (accidentally) owns the German company Winterthur, which  (accidentally) built a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan and was bought by the  German Allianz, which (coincidentally) has Vanguard as a shareholder, who  (coincidentally) is a shareholder of Black Rock,"" which (coincidentally)  controls central banks and manages about a third of global investment  capital.  ""Black Rock"" is also (coincidentally) a major shareholder of MICROSOFT,  owned by Bill Gates, who (coincidentally) is a shareholder of Pfizer (which  - remember?

2,And how many die from the flu ?
1,"Exactly what I thought and knew and heard about a long time ago. 90% of any death has the hash tag, ""death by Covid"", even if the reason is ridiculous"
2,Look up tuberculosis deaths! We don’t quarantine for that????? This was a control test!!!
2,Funny no one got the flu in 2020
2,This was all pre-planned by the left
2,In my mind you cant support western medicine in general and not support the covid narrative. They are one in the same. Science projects. Intended fpr a particular result. The result not being what the recipient thinks it will be.
1,Frankenstein fauci facilitates appocolytic viruses! coverup specialists! Resulting in mail in ballots results Venezuela style election! landslide at midnight! Come on man!
1,I've been saying the same thing I was telling everyone I know that the doctors I use to work with were pressured to put down covid when it started regardless of what the person death was. Also we got word after the election when patato head cheated some of the employees at the hospital said they weren't gonna do no more screening.
1,"The President, (""our President of the United States""), has just not only saved the United States Citizens, ""(our family members)"";' but He, has saved the World also with this vaccine.. We the People,  and the World;  ( ""THANK YOU"",; President TRUMP ),."
1,My poor husband still has to quarantine to get to work  in another country losing time and money for over a year. This is a scam . Life has been so complicated because of this stupid virus
1,"I will never take that poison and I will die fighting it this is a government conspiracy to weed out the population, let them give it to the black and brown illegal communities first"
1,"If you die by falling off a ladder, they will say you've died from covid !"
1,"We know the hospitals were making money for the reported covid diagnosis. The government paid hospitals: $13k per day every patient, for every ventilator used $48k, for every 120 patients reported to have covid $$78 k..  Hospitals wanted deaths reported as covid causes, although few were actually for covid, because it was a money maker!!!"
1,Scam by democrats! They all belong in jail!
1,"Plandemick! Dems, china and fauci  did this to pull off there coup!"
1,Dr Fauchi was deeply involved in the creation of this virus together with Bill Gates
2,Mail-in ballots proved to be the cure
1,COVID-19 numbers are just as inflated as Biden’s alleged votes
1,"Within 2 years, the Vaccinations will kill more people, than the virus. SM-102 ☠"
1,"I heard er has been told to list all deaths even gunshot as Covid.
This is to keep the numbers up and Validate the need for Vax.
Like N. Korea, ""You can lead a Country with Fear."""
1,Fauci needs to be Prosecuted for War Crimes.
2,Are you nuts Leven they get paid more money for claiming covid deaths gosh maybe I should be a journalist! This has been common knowledge for more than a year!
2,SO HAPPY THE TRUTH IS FINALLY COMMING OUT.     PLANDEMIC!!!!
2,"JEEZ I ONLY WISH WE HERE IN THE UK HAD GOOD DOCTORS LIKE THAT 1 STANDING UP FOR HIS PATIENTS. 11 YEARS AND COUNTING MY DOCTORS RUINED MY VERY GOOD STRONG HEALTHY BODY BECAUSE THEY PUT ME ON MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF OPIATES FOR BAD HEADACHES, I LOST MY GOOD/SOME FRIENDS BECAUSE WHEN I FORGOT TO TAKE THEM FOR JUST 2 DAYS I CRASHED [WITHDRAWAL] PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE UK THINK WE HAVE 1 OF THE BST HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS [IT;S NOT] IT;S AS CORRUPT AS THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLLING THEM. 11 YEARS AND ONLY 6 MONTHS AGO I FIND OUT IT;S BN THE PAINKILLERS NOT/E THEY COVERED THEIR ARSES WITH I;M SOOO PISSED OFF."

America & The World with Blatant Knowingly 
Spread of CCP C19 throughout the World

Whilst withholding information about the coronavirus from the outside world, China was preparing and planning to combat the hard times ahead, and as a result have been the first major economy to get back running at full capacity,"""
2,I was told by healthcare workers ) friends ) who are never heard.5-23-21 and just hearing this now.
2,The reaaon the Doctors are being pressured to increase the numbers is because hospitals get paid more for Covid deaths.
,I don't believe in the vaccine
1,"Stop listening Mark Levin since began pushing the vaccine as American ingenuity, and Trump succeeds without knowing o maybe he did that was experimental and that long collateral damage is no known. 
Also big guns like him, Beck, Savage,Hannity, are betting on take the house back .its a mistake, our Federal government is broke.the Fight is in the STATES LEGISLATURES. The only guy who understands that is DANIEL HOROWITZ. Who is organizing Patriots volunteers in each red state to push Republican politicians 
To follow the constitution.  Unfortunately none of the talk radio is promoting his agenda. Shame on them"
2,China got our money from him to create virus biowepon.
2,THIS IS BEING DONE TO SEE HOW FAR THEY CAN PUSH US . THE DEEP STATE ARE EVIL SATANIST SOB'S . WAKE UP PEOPLE .
2,My friend he was in the gain off function research even the department say no then he move to china the study that's was the mistake because they're using ccp virus as a weapon
2,"....the Dems Moaned, complained, Fought NOT to have Legally Correct Actions to recount Disputed Election Ballots!  Think they’re going to go to Investigate False Death certificates?!  No matter WHAT evidence was uncovered?"
1,What I am witnessing everyday is extremely bothering. Folks having so much fear won't even take off a mask while outside although the CDC indicated those vaccinated can. Once we lose faith in the air we breathe we are deeply at a lost . Never chose to wear a mask outside since mask wearing became prevalent nor have any interest in taking a vaccination. Are we forgetting the power of our own immunity system. I cherish the sciences as well as a healthy lifestyle. The immunity systems will fight off anything if we took care of ourselves accordingly. Stop allowing your system to turn into a garbage disposal. Take time to do some form of exercise.
2,100+in agreement. Trump was making efforts to have Fauci dismiss
2,the numbers are being pumped up by liars period Levin get it right it's not bad data gathering it's pure lies.
2,"The US government r playing politic & habe hidden agenda. This has been ingrain ìnto  the government system So no matter which party is in control, it will just cruse along. It will eventually destroy US & western along with iy one day. God have mercy on u lot"
2,"Could not agree anymore with what is mentioned in this video.  We need to trust the science, but why? If we trusted the science, why are CDC recommendations changing month-to-month? We trust the science one month then have to start trusting it in another direction.  
When something doesn't seem right or make sense, typically isn't!"
1,It's all in the leftist socialist agenda.
2,"Well now, a year later and Mr Fauci is still blithering on and on with his ever changing story.  Dr Ericson and his group have all been stifled ... what more do you need to now. Senator Dr Rand Paul gave Fauci a grilling over NIH funding p4 lab gain of function research. He tried to deny it but Senator Paul had him by the short hairs"
2,"I remember if anyone who smoked died of lung cancer, they would automatically say it was the smoking, iven if the cancer was caused by something else or metastasized from another organ. They wouldn't even look to see."
1,Covid created to rig an election. yrs. later still under the same oppression. And not letting anytime soon. And the wezel troll still can't make up his mind to wear face diapers or not.
2,Hello I'm not quite sure that went through notice having a little bit of trouble okay if we have more of the epidemic coming around why are we letting people across the border with all kinds of diseases do they really care or they want to keep it going and going and going we should be closed down get everything under control we don't ask them to check and see if they even have it what are we doing well I don't think the American people are crazy I'm wondering about the government I've never seen a government like this and I've lived a long time well oh where are the children need to know where the children I have a fear that they're lost to us forever is that true where are the children are they safe who are they with where are they going we as Americans have a right to know we love children we love America
2,If they're so worried about Corona why are they letting of all these people cross the border that have it we just had some more come over from where they have really bad outbreaks I don't remember which country it is but it wasn't any of the countries we dealt with now these are people that really need help I understand that but why are we letting more come over with different viruses to give us this is ridiculous if I do and Biden we're so worried about it they would not let anyone come over they would keep us shut down till we got it under control again but they keep letting them come over and over and over they don't test them they don't give them shots so what is going on here are we all that stupid or maybe they could explain to us what they're doing protect the American people thank you very much
1,Good for you. They are trying to push the  vaccine. We need to all stand up and say enough  NO
1,"Why is that indeed ! Its never been about a virus...its about the great reset....why do all these talking heads refuse to acknowledge that ,I wonder...Not bad data collection its treason  The great reset.Soros Gates IMF , W E F , etc...why do they hide that fact ???"
1,"It’s totally unethical and to place the carrot (💰💵💵💰) of money , Dangling in  front of Hospital Administrators and Doctors at the complete disregard for a Human’s Life ....    MONEY FOR DIAGNOSIS ... MONEY FOR ADMISSION FOR COVID ..... MONEY FOR ICU ADMITS ..... MOST MONEY FOR ICU PATIENT PLACED ON VENTILATOR WHO SUCCUMBS ..... I CAN SEE HOW THE MAJORITY OF CHRISTIANS BELIEVE THIS IS THE (Devil’s Game) (THE Bill Gates of Hell  opened and now SWALLOWING HUMANITY = The Profiteering Bill Gates)"
1,Dont believe the fake media. Covid is not anything they say it is .its all about them trying to get there bioweapon jab that is only meant to take you out
2,Thank you Mark Levin for all you do.
2,"yes, and who is the one that brought him into the WH? PENCE! PENCE IS ANTI TRUMP, WORKING AGAINST HIM AND HE AND RYAN HAD A COUP TO GET RID OF TRUMP FROM THE GET GO!"
2,He has a personal stake..stock in vaccine and virus patent.
2,There was a law made in Congress in the 1980’s to allow people in  etc... to OWN PATENTS ON THINGS THEY “DISCOVER” USING TAXPAYER FUNDING.
2,it's about politics.
1,"Thank you, Great One. I have heard reports that if someone dies in a car crash and a post-mortem blood test (to see if alcohol or drugs were a cause of the crash) finds the The COVID virus or its antibodies, then the  cause of death on the driver's death certificate is listed as ""COVID-19."""

Inflation. Border Crisis. Supply shortages. Multiple hackings. Currency devaluation. Looming war with China and threats of Nuclear attacks on US soil. Race war. Culture war. Increasing medical costs. Unstable markets and housing bubble. Vast overreaching regulation by the ATF. Trillions added to debt. .......... and this list could go on and on. 
We are 4.5 months into with Democrat controlled Congress and we are in a rapid decline that millions of people will never see coming. 
Now is the time to pray like never before,  practice frugality, and spread wisdom through kindness. 
God Help Us in the months to come. We are going to need it."

1,"I don't know where Sarah Palin went to school, but she is clearly a bonafide genius. This woman's intellect is off the charts. Her intuition is unparalleled and her wisdom is a joy. Her boobs look great too, for a woman her age."
2,"On 6 Jan 2021 the Congress was discussing the possibility of an illegal election. Before the 1st protested state, Arizona, had the full evidence of the irregularities exposed... a fully orchestrated, illegal, domestic terrorist backed riot took place in the Capitol. The intent of the ""deep state"" was realized when the riot stopped the legitimate debate on the issue at hand. Congress was evacuated and the debate stopped. The Capitol was cleared of rioters, and later that evening, Congress returned and, as expected, the fire for finding the problem had burned out, as the ""deep state"" planned it. There are videos of Capitol Police waving the protestors onto the Capitol lawn and into the building. According to some, facial recognition software has identified ""Antifa"" members in the rioting crowd. As they did in the summer riots, normally peaceful people were antagonized by the anti fascists and followed along. The end result was attained... justifying the means. Debate stopped and Biden was certified by unchallenged slates of electoral votes. The Georgia challenge and the few challenges that came afterward received overwhelming votes against and the electoral protest procedure was halted in tis tracks. Not unexpectedly, there were soon calls from the left for V.P. Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the POTUS... and if he doesn't agree, we will start impeachment proceedings. The ""deep state"" has tried for 4 years to remove Donald J. Trump from office an they will not stop... even 12 days before the end of his term. ""He is dangerous!"", they say. ""He incited a riot!"", they say. The truth is, that with the intelligence that he still has access to... he is a threat to their illegal livelihood and has been for 4 years. It scares them to death that their truths may be revealed. For the left and the deep state, it is truly a matter of life and death to remove Trump. As Hillary Clinton said, (paraphrased), ""If that S.O.B. gets elected, we'll all hang by nooses."" Truer words were never spoken. Donald Trump was not as vindictive as he should have been, and he allowed them to slide. BIG MISTAKE!!!! A majority of the left and a goodly portion of the right are involved in enriching themselves from activities that are surely less than above board in the USA. They all fear the consequences. Some would surely face death for their crimes. We can only pray that justice will be served."
1,"Patriots and True conservatives, dump all the technology company stocks who have banned Trump and Conservatives. You are the one making them rich and cut their branches one by one.  Also do not support any company, person or media who is against freedom of expression."
2,Palin is not someone I! would want to be associated with. Those who actually educate themselves about these things compare her to Palosi or Feinstein. She's a mental case nut job with to much power.
1,"I never thought I would say this but, I agree with Sarah Palin.  I'm for Trump our President and he is right."
2,He might have been re-elected if he built infrastructure and not a border wall.
0,BIDEN BEAT TRUMP!!!! 😂😂😂😂

2,17k dislikes but i don't see any negative comments. Cnn probably bought dislike bots to attack this
1,The same people wanting to disarm citizens want to defund the police but want citizens to depend on the police instead of protecting themselves hmmm
2,"here is a Grown ass man that struggles with some common sense issues.. 
we have the (2nd amendment) to protect ourselves. 
or we can ask the criminals to wait until the police arrive to hopefully protect us.."
2,This channel is full of Fake News!
0,"Two bimbos with guns wow, I am glad I don't live in that gunslinging country, they have no idea. Take two other countries similar to the USA like the UK and Australia, those countries have very tight laws on gun ownership, they don't have people daily running around killing people on the streets, work, schools and so on, households don't have stacks of assault weapons ready to go. I think those who own guns are the ones who shouldn't. That's my thought, I won't be replying to any reply to my comment, gun nuts can have the last word ...Don't shoot, I am unarmed(not that it matters)."

1,the poor antifa (hollywood actors) are afraid of guns . it makes their riots too dangerous.
1,"The anti gun activists over exaggerating to make their case don't use logic or common sense!!!! People who own A -R 15 don't walk around with it when they're out in public.  They most always keep it at home to DEFEND themselves, their family and their property.  Anyone who carries a gun with them carries a handgun.  
AND PEOPLE WHO CARRY A GUN ON THEM FOR SELF DEFENSE DON'T ACT AS VIGILANTES.  IF HE DOESN'T WANT A GUN FOR SELF DEFENSE, THAT'S HIS DECISION AND RIGHT..
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYONE ELSE HAS TO !!!!!!!!"
2,How many weapons allowed the Confederacy the right to lose without a disgraceful history? Joe?
1,Women do not marry a Democrat. They don't even know how to protect their own. They'll just watch while you and your children are molested or at worst killed
1,"A gun is like a parachute,  if you ever need one and dont have it , you'll probably never need one again.  !! 
 The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun, is a good guy with a gun.  You may not believe in god and you might not believe in guns.  But if I kick in your door at 2 am with a knife.  The first 2 things you're going to do is 1 call someone with a gun and 2 pray they get there in time 🤷‍♂️"
1,"I could respect you more if you just gave up and said I have no answer for that. This is why we have to beat the dead horse, because clowns like this think we should just wait for the police, guess what sir they've been defunded, they're not coming."
2,Didn't they want to cancel law enforcement one time? 🤔🤔🤔
1,"We have vp biedumb to our rescue. He couldn't pull his thumb out of his ass without pelosi holding his nasty balls. God help Us. Thank you fox for this National Treasure. It would not have been possible without fox, cavuto and walace."
2,Please come for our guns. Give us the final excuse we need for civil war.
1,You'll never win an argument with a liberal. They're too stupid to learn.
1,"Another idiot. So if younuse ""assault type weapon"" in self defense does that now change the weapon to defense type weapon? Another one that wants to strip the law abiding citizen from any means of self defense and rely on government... Socialist maybe?"
2,The level of hipocracy by these folks is sickening.
2,I live in Downtown LA I was in front of the police station the other day I take my dog down there I would please dog I take him down there to go play with them on the front lawn I bet gentleman was out there throwing glass bottles at me and my dog the police would not even come to the door then the guy lit a fire in front of the police station on the grass still didn't do nothing I had to get in my car and run the red light to get the hell out of there
2,In 7 to 10 minutes the criminal is finished doing his damage and is now skipping merrily down the street to find his next victim.
2,"The Democrats shot them selves in the foot when the riots were going on they cried ""defund the police"" and a single breath later. ""We need more gun control"". ""Turn in your AR 15s"". The events of 2020 is the reason we got the AR 15. Less police, more crime, and take your guns away. What is wrong with their logic."
1,if the KKK or a member of the KKK went to this guys house to do him harm he would say to himself man i wish i had a gun.
1,"Heard it somewhere, one gun more powerful than the whole police force on the phone."
0,"First no guns for self-defense and now no police departments.
Brilliant liberals.
Just brilliant."
2,"Happy only when thugs have guns and nobody else, but then!, wonders what happened when they come after him or his family.
Sometimes ignorance is not bliss buddy"
0,Nobody needs an AR15 to defend themselves.  There is no need to have a weapon which can hold upto 25 rounds of ammunition and fire off that ammunition ina automatic mode.  All pushing to have households to be allowed to have weapons means that households are going to absolutely need them.  The only beneficiaries to this are the ultra wealthy who can have their own armed guards and the weapons companies.  The rest of the country suffers.
1,"This SOCIALIST is a COMPLETE MORON. You Sir, have the choice to walk down the street without a firearm. Good for you but don't INFRINGE on my Right to the Second Amendment and my Right to DEFEND my Family and myself!"
1,"What, exactly, is wrong with being a vigilante? If that’s the price for exercising my constitutional rights, call me so. It bears being dead.
I’m 66 years old, I’ve had to show a firearm twice. Both times, it ended the threat."
1,"Uh, aren't these the same idiots calling all police racists and attempting to defund the police but now they're saying to rely on the police and trust the system of law? REALLY!!! These idiots truly don't have a clue.  

Plus, I can't rely on the police since y'all idiots keep blocking the streets as you riot and protest the same police you want me to call in an emergency. No thanks, I'll stick with my guns and not have to worry about calling the police."
2,Who do you need to be protected from if you don't have guns? Just buy a stungun on amazon.
1,"Criminals by nature don't five a F about the law. Make guns illegal and only the criminals will have them. I'd like to think these anti 2A people have a sinister agenda, but knowing many of them, most of them are deeply naive and unfortunately stupid. And then there are those with an agenda. We have 2A exclusively for ""them""."
2,"Damn this guy nailed it.  All I can say is I guess the joke goes if a republican can't rely on police, they let Jesus take the wheel"
1,"""We have a system that's built to protect us.""
Where the hell does this man live?
I live on a rural farm, and have only had to call the Sheriff's deputies twice in 32 years. One time took them 30 minutes to arrive. The other time took 45minutes. My wife and I will keep our firearms."
1,"Hasn't Mexico outlawed private ownership of guns? Well, now the country is awash with cartels who can do pretty much whatever they want to the unarmed civilians, and they do."
2,The IQ of this clown strategist doesn't allow him to distinguish between a vigilanti and self defense
2,But all these federal agencies and SWAT will keep them I guarantee you
1,300 lb. black man is an idiot!
1,Brainwashed a smart person to get USSR results.  Apparently method still works. Senator Boxer former california “representing” California called for all gun owners to voluntarily turn in weapons.  She made a BIG deal in media coverage of putting her guns into pile.  ... later it was discovered she kept UNREGISTERED guns at home. This man was brainwashed.  So defund police is next step in his future or stand up to defend his American rights under constitution. Which will it be?  He has right to abdicate but should respect everybody else’s right to protect themselves OR head off to China for more intense indoctrination and loss of all his finances under great reset - China leads world in use of social media to control everyone.  First rule down that path is disarm population. Communists ALWAYS do that. So do dictators.
1,Such an idiot guns are so we can defend ourselves from the government he is a commuist why they bring this people ajoke

1,Typical democrat can't answer the question and they also are against our second amendment rights and nazi 🇩🇪 mentality when it comes to firearms 🔫!!!!!!!
1,"Why does the left feel that every law abiding firearm owner, owns one to use it on other humans?  Something tells me that those who are against firearms are just telling you ""what"" they would do if they owned a firearm!  Lesson being, those against firearms should not be allowed to own, or even handle, a firearm."
1,Democrats are so dumb.
2,I wish Liz would go off on libtards more often because she is great at it.  This tool bag needs to go pound sound.
1,"That guy didn't care that the attacker had a gun. 
He was more worried that the victim shouldn't have a gun to protect him or her self. 
The criminals will always have guns 🔫 even when they are ban."
2,THAT DUDE is a MORON!!!!!!
1,Liberals are just so dumb.
1,"Liberals: the police are racist Nazis and should be defunded
Liberals: only the police should have guns
Conclusion: liberals are insane"

2,"IF HIS DAUGHTER WAS ATTACKED...HIS VIEWS WOULD BE QUITE DIFFERENT! MAYBE NOT!
WHAT A MORON!"
2,"we have law enforcement....""defund the police""... you can not have both your cake and eat it."
2,The level of idiociy this guy is at is just astonishing. He does not belong in a free nation like this. He should take Washington and move to China where they all belong.
1,Your argument is hilarious mr. black man.
2,His answer to the question of who innocent people should rely on to defend themselves if law enforcement can't get there....society. Oh..
1,"Depend on law enforcement to protect you .... lmfao. No thanks, I can defend myself, and they wouldn't be here in time to defend me anyway even if I couldn't."

2,drain the swamp and big corporations
1,Trump the best President!❤️🇺🇸👍
2,"This was an official, on the record, approved by NATO deal to get rid of a corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine! Viktor Shokin refused to press corruption charges against the previous administration, TWO YEARS before Hunter Biden was offered the job at Burisma. He may not have been experienced, but he is well educated, and I would very much like someone to show me a pay stub, because I am curious about how much they paid to regain respectability. 

That’s what they thought they were getting, after the Ukrainian Revolution, and the removal of the previous corrupt government and the former owner of Burisma. The Ukrainians are desperately fighting for their independence from Russia and its influence. They mistakenly thought it would look good to hire the USVP’s son. That’s all there is to that."
2,It is a shame what they are purposely doing to this great nation we don't deserve any of this  WE HAVE TO STOP THE GREED AT THE TOP SO OUR COUNTRY CAN HEAL WE ARE THE BEST
2,Could this explain why both Republicans and Democrats leave Congress much wealthier than when they came in

1,"Because of Dems cheating, I will not be voting in any future elections. They rigged it once, they can rig it again"
0,Christina - you failed to mention how trump and his grifter family took the entire US government for an expensive ride while coming very close to overthrowing our very precious democracy.  And you need to recognize the difference between advocacy and lies - this version is more lies than truth.
2,"Strong, powerful woman are an anathema and bain to donald trump.  I urge strong, powerful women like Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Maxine Waters, etc., troll him daily till he closes his eyes in death enroute to his destiny of hell."

2,We know what they did and how they did it! We (the TRUE MAJORITY) want our country back !
2,Nothing wrong with the US Constitution or Declaration of Independence. It is people don't know what it is.
1,"Biden administration failed all categories of the US Constitution and Declaration of Independence. They stole the (videos of Absolute Proof by Michael Lindell) election and don't care about the USA citizens. They appease the gullible while they skim off the assets they call ""relief,"" ""covid,"" ""global warming "" or ""infrastructure "" bills are to aid other countries they themselves have invested in. China's road initiative are all from USA citizens tax money."
2,"Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:—I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."""

1,"Americans need to fight to get Trump back into office. At least Trump fights against corruption, were as Biden is so corrupt to the core."
2,That’s a Democrat for you but you know what we can see through all the smoke the curtain has been pulled back and we are not going to be fooled any longer and
2,That’s OK they can hate them we don’t care because that’s Republicans love him and his family

2,Was thinking about him the other day and was glad he wasn't around to see what's going on lately in bidens Afghanistan  but I think he knows
2,Thank you for your service.  I love this country ❤🇺🇲
1,"There are some Americans who understand war very well! They are known as the Industrial military complex, with great support from the democratic party, aka the new Communist party of America. Once we get out of Afghanistan they will give it a LITTLE time to blow over. And then they will find another 20-year war to continue that money flow!!!"
2,"Chris is a sucker for the Globalist Elites who start these stupid wars, and he needs to think a bit more deeply instead of being naive and gullible.
Just ask yourself a simple question:  Do the super rich Globalist Elites ever send their children or grand children to fight their stupid wars?
Our very own Henry Ford built trucks for the German Wermacht during WW2 in Cologne and while the whole of Cologne was littered bombed flat to the ground by the Allies, miraculously the Ford factory in Cologne remained undamaged.
Wake up."
2,Can you imagine if chris was here today seeing what’s going on in this country ..I would hate to imagine his thoughts
2,"Killed so many people for the weapons manufacturers and oil interests.
St. Peter will not be amused.
Better get his glory here, because it's a different destiny when the curtain comes down."
2,"The mistake here is that no matter which scenario is presented, everyone tries to win the cause through oratory. When you have political factions seeking to tear this nation down and all we hear is how much this nation has the ability to never act. The have taken saying of there is a time for talk and a time for action and turned it into there is a time for talk and then some more time for talk and never time for action....no matter how oppressive the government becomes we are told to never act..."
2,"RIP Chris, in this day what America is going thru u would probably throw up. Thanks for ur service."
2,"Virtually everyone serving in the military doesnt understand it either, particularly kids with virtually no life experience."
2,"Chris Kyle, like Stephen Glass, was a serial fabulist who told fabricated story after fabricated story. Mr. Kyle’s medal count claim was contradicted by the United States Department of Navy. His “Hurricane Katrina Sniper Story” was contradicted by both Army Lieutenant General Russell Honore and the United States Special Operations Command.

Mr. Kyle’s “Punching Jesse Ventura Story” was contradicted by the Coronado Police, while his “Texas Car Jacking Story” was contradicted by both the Johnson County Sheriff and the Johnson County District Attorney.

Considering the trove of fabricated stories told by Chris Kyle that have been discredited by both military and law enforcement personnel, it is highly likely that many of the stories contained in Mr. Kyle’s book also have been fabricated, either partially or totally."
2,"this guy was full of himself 
do the job you signed up for and dont expect the tax payer to pat you on the back all the god damned time 
I heard he made up stuff in his book too although the constant ""thank us for our service"" is the more obnoxious"
2,"Most Americans don't understand the TRUTH about the war, many fighting it don't either, including kyle"
2,He a con artist him and his wife profiting from lies over lies
2,If you.know someone that fought in Vietnam or Korea or www and they talked to you you know war. My daddy talked about crawling. Over dead bodies that were rotting. My friends in Korean war. About being shot at. My friends in Vietnam had nightmares of dropping bombs knowing that they are also killing Children . All of the above goes for.modern war. God bless them all. Pray fir them abs be their friend.
2,"Anyone disliking this interview should be sent for a week of basic training. Men and women in the military should be held far higher in regard than any movie star,musician and most certainly,politicians. Thank you to all who have served,past ,present and who will in the future!"
2,"....of course,... they are grappling to understand the logic..when there is no one attacking USA...to understand the reason why US is fighting so many wars all over the world..scondaring trillions of $...sacrificing many young American lives....crazy situation..and to understand why the largest country on  this planet Russia is not fighting any...crazy.."
2,An American hero
2,"Ya we're a rag tag civilian army in this fight, but we're on the front lines of battle for this Country right now, and we're learning on our feet!"
2,What a tragic end of this honorable soldier. May he Rest In Peace.
2,"How does a country surrender, then go to war."
2,If he was alive he’d be a powerhouse politician
2,"Most Americans understand war, they just don't understand people who always want war."
2,"This popped up in my recommendation out of nowhere and all I can say is, give us a few more months maybe sooner and America will be in a civil war."
2,They don't know war never had anything bad happen.spoiled brats that don't get thier way
2,"Most American's realize that Wars are Created for Profit and Control... 
and for a Government to Use its people to Fight and Die in a Foreign Land for Nothing more than Profit and Control... well, Not Good.
It is Governments that spread False Claims to enter into ie
Iraq... Kuwait... Benghazi... Vietnam... Afghanistan... Syria... the List is Long... Lives Lost for what exactly... and How was America safer...?"
2,I still feel that Obama had something to do with this....
2,Most soldiers don’t understand war either.
2,Many Americans will not know how much of a liar you were in life.
0,Only Joe Biden could figure this out with his sharp mind as Commander-in-Chief.
2,All participants in War are guilty of War Crimes unless they are Victorious. History is written by Victors.
2,"don't worry americans, now pregnant women will protect you."
2,The man who made a living and  bragged about murdering hundreds of people which was never verified. No one in military should ever brag about murder. liar
2,I don't believe it's possible to understand war without training and serving to save your life and other's lives. On top of that there are lessons only historical studies can teach us and that takes years. People are too innocent to understand war and I think that's a good thing but there's a lot of work left to do here and abroad and ignorance is no excuse.
2,Agreed most Americans don’t understand war. They just want to enjoy their lifestyle and let others do the dirty work
1,..Democrats destroying the name of democrats in this country all by themselves
2,Year 2021 - Sad to think that a REAL AMERICAN like CHRIS KYLE isnt here.  He is missed every day by so many. RIP   GOD BLESS HIS FAMILY <3

2,"First,  A 👍 to many on these comments...  For me,  Who he was,  & his story,  It really didn’t click until I saw the movie quite some time after the movie came out in 2014...  I watched and thought it was an excellent movie that gave many of us just a little hint of what he and ALL the others who served over there had to deal with...
The hardest part for me,  was the tail end when suddenly you hear what starts out like TAPS ,  then flows into the beautiful closing theme,  Along with  the LONG FUNERAL procession  coming down the Interstate with all the LIGHTS  &  FLAG bearing Bikes driving down through the Hundreds of people lined up alongside the highway  & the bridges in the rain to pay their respects to a true American🇺🇸Hero ;  And I was in tears,  and then the picture of COWBOY  STADIUM where HUNDREDS were gathered to say goodbye...       RIP Chris Kyle   😢  👍"
2,Most of America’s combatants don’t know for whom or for what they are fighting.
2,Chris... God's blessings. Great patriot.
2,I bet Chris Kelly  Could have told you That you could serve in the military and believe in God.
2,"What is more stupid than over paid athletes comparing sports to war ?
Nothing."
2,"I don't know about most americans, but yes some definitely don't understand war. But I'm not ignorant enough to believe in a god, or the words from Chris Kyle. A proven liar. I'm glad that he was over there killing those people indiscriminately. Men, women, and children. I don't think he was a hero, but a very good killer. Hallelujah brother !"
2,"Thank you- Patriots for you service and loyalty to you country ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸!!!!!!
God bless you and God bless America 🙏!!!!!!!!!"
2,"This guy was a lying hack and fraud.  He wants to claim that war is horrific but look at what he's wearing, Punisher symbols.  He was right about Americans not understanding war but he's a hypocrite lying about it and glorifying it.   He also made up a lie about Jesse Ventura saying that he was smearing veterans so he beat up Ventura.  Absolute fiction."
2,Redskin name show just show the brainwashing people get when they keep doing racism.
2,As a native american i am offended that you change the redskins name and not the cowboys why do white people still get a team and we dont
2,"I'm white. I've been white all my life. I have Indian friends. I've asked them are you offended by being called an Indian. Each time I was told know because they grew up with the word. Do I ask them are they offended by the grade school BIG Chief Writing tablet. They said know. 

If I had to be identified politically, I'm left, and I'm really tired of white people panic with all the PC titles. 

No one I know has ever asked the person they felt should be offended IF they are offended. They just assume. It makes me nuts."
2,The VERY few people that actually support this are not interested in what actual Native Americans have to say. It has nothing to do with not causing offense; it is 100% about control.
2,"the indians had a face in nfl, not anymore"
1,"The only people who want the name change are arrogant, stupid, no common sense, s**t for brains liberals in this country."
1,"They should change the name to "" The Washington Mexicans "".  That would make all Mexicans proud that they can finally  cross the border illegally with the blessings of ""Hyena"" Harris and the dummycRATs in Washington and be part of the American dream."
1,Whenever there’s a race issue 95% of the people offended are white liberals and a good 5 % are the group actually offended therefore liberals are snowflakes
1,Woke left destroying America … losers
2,"Just be the Washington Crooks, you already have a bunch of mascots at the capital."
2,Native American's not from here. Stop playing them people from Northern Russia. Not America. They are Siberian. The definition of Redskin= North American Indian. That's a mixed Mexican on this interview 😂😂😂😂
2,Would you walk up to a Native- American and call him or her a redskin?
2,Why don’t the NY Jets change their name? Doesn’t their name partially reference one of the biggest terrorist attacks on AMERICA? While we’re at it let’s give the right to have a say about it to every single person who wasn’t affected by it!
1,"Actually, the offended cancel culture babies have taken something away from the Native American by denying them tributes to their ancestry. Those titles of teams as respectful and honorable. It is a shame the Indian nation did not see it that way and come in defense of the team and themselves.  This isn't the first time this has happened. The cancel culture couldn't care less if the native American dropped out of sight into obscurity and eventual extinction.  
Shame on the native Americans for not speaking out in defense of themselves."
2,"Redskins is racism towards native Americans apparently. 
Imagine if a team was named “Black skins” people would be offended and call it racism towards black people. 
If a team was called White skins people would say it’s white supremacy. Funny how that works"
1,Democrats are the biggest racist on Earth an Indian should be ashamed of themselves for following the slave drive and Democrat that are truly racist and killed them off
1,"One of my cousins is from the Ute tribe. He said most Indians think the Redskin name is badass and intimidating and that only ""well fed white people"" cry about this."

1,Well there you have it folks. leftist political correctness is a mental condition.
1,See an actual Native American came out an said it wasn’t racist enough of these white libtrads speaking for them!!!🖕🏽🖕🏽
2,"God Bless Mark OneWolf Yancey for supporting the Redskins Name! Question for most of these SJW's who are not even Native American Indians: How does changing Athletic Team names actually help the plight of Americans who live on Reservations?
    Will name changing help Organizations like Native American Guardian's Associations help their cause? 
    Plan Parenthood and the Hindering Government programs have done great harm to Native American Indians than name changes ever could!"
2,nam--> vietnam- dumb as- gookologists!
2,How about they change the name to the caucasiens. Then we’ll see how “racist” it truly is.
2,It’s obviously cultural pride..... who names their own cities team after an insult?? It’s American history. We fought the natives for hundreds of years. The reason we name it the Jeep Cherokee is because it’s viewed as badass..... not insulting.
0,Removal of the Awesome Native American logo was EXTREMELY DISCRIMINATORY!
2,I totally agree when I take the shirt off my white brows and women oh you are so white never got a tan however 10 hrs in sun I am a real redskin then I was rushed to hospital for burns I would love to have red skin and beautiful black k hair
0,Breaking news: Native Americans are able to have varying opinions. I too am a Native American and I am against Native mascots in areas where Natives are a minority. I shockingly have the audacity not to speak for other people so yes there are Natives who aren't offended and yes there are Natives who are against Native mascots. I don't know who needs to hear this but Native people don't get together and decide a collective opinion and then the rest of us have to follow it.
2,"The Redskins can avoid the racist charge by changing their mascot to a Redskin Potato! :-)

Many teams have aggressive names: the Bears, the Bengals (tigers), the Eagles, etc.  In a similar vein, the name Redskin was chosen because American Indians were viewed as tough warriors.  It was really intended as a compliment.

The people claiming that Redskins is a racist term have not been able to find a single documented instance of the term Redskins being used in a derogatory manner since the 1920s.  It's doubtful there is single person alive who has heard the term Redskins used as a racial slur.  The meanings of a word sometimes changes and the word Redskins is one such word.  Redskin hasn't been a slur in at least a century."
1,See they don’t care it’s just white liberals taking away heritage
2,Isn't it racist to change the name and logo? Change the color red also
2,Gary Clark of the Washington Redskins conducted at least 3 football camps at Native American reservations during his career. He wanted to know if they thought the Redskins name was racist. What he saw was Native Americans wearing Redskins gear and saying that they were proud to be a Redskin fan and the 5% that weren’t Redskins fans were Cowboys fans and that’s why they didn’t like the name.
1,The minority wants to cancel everything
0,The name and logo never offended me. It was always the fans wearing headdresses and regalia they’d call “costumes” that’s the racist part people don’t understand
1,"Chief Operating Officers, Chief Chefs, Chief Surgeons, Fire Chiefs .....where does it freaking stop lib tards?
I think someone wants us to forget that native American ever existed.....my wife grandmother is Pawnee....that's what she thinks
It's all about white millienial women who have been taught to tell guilty, wah wah. Notice how native Americans aren't even offended
Past.  White man takes land"
0,"Present.   Leftists forces our opinions"""
2,It’s funny how white people decide what’s racist for other races.
1,Wouldn't the Vikings be racist too??? LOL
1,Yes I totally agree change the name and let’s stop promoting Native Americans as warriors let’s stop promoting these people as successful I think we should totally change the name and I think we should totally stop using well these people who are here first who are successful at building well piles of dirt as successful and admirable societies

0,People are so broke in CA they have to rent a room in a house just to survive and stay off the streets and out of living in their vehicle. There is still a problem with landlords justifying evictions and against the law causing people to move out within a day's notice and having their security deposits stolen. Landlords can continue to make security deposits over false notions and make people's lives worse. The houses are not necessarily being torn down. They're just converted. It would be nice if a studio apartment didn't cost more than you make at a minimum wage job that you have to walk to because you still can't afford a vehicle. Craziness.

2,"""Liberals, progressives, Democrats and other rational thinkers must accept one crucial reality if they are to save America's democracy: Those who live in the right-wing echo chamber really do believe what they are being told. Those beliefs are now extensions of their core identities...

And as anyone who's watched Fox knows, its fundamental message is rage at what liberals are doing to our country. Over the years the specific message has changed with the times — from terrorism to open borders to Benghazi to Christian cake bakers to critical race theory — but it's always about what liberal politicians are doing to cripple America, usually with a large dose of thinly veiled racism to give it emotional heft...

The Fox pipeline is pretty simple. Fox News stokes a constant sense of outrage among its base of viewers, largely by highlighting narratives of white resentment and threats to Christianity. This in turn forces Republican politicians to follow suit. It's a positive feedback loop that has no obvious braking system, and it's already radicalized the conservative base so much that most Republicans literally believe that elections are being stolen and democracy is all but dead if they don't take extreme action."" - Unknown"

0,"Israel needs to learn how to get along with their neighbors better, instead of provoking hostility, then expecting US to support the defense they wouldnt need, if they learned how to behave diplomatically.
Instead, they behave like the neighborhood bullies, arrogantly believing they can get away with any abuses of their neighbors, because of our military support. We shouldnt make ourselves a partner in this.

Unfortunately, that's basically how their current nation was built - by pushing, bullying, & forcing their way into the region, with so many offences committed, doubtful anyone wants to play nice with them, now... They have left themselves with no choice, except to annihilate their enemies, or be annihilated, & that is exactly how they behave - like all the Palestinians must be annihilated, all their land taken, in order for Israel to exist, at all. That is a corner they backed themselves into - when they showed no willingness to show compassion to their fellow humans, or seek out peace, thru diplomacy - always resorting to brute force to achieve purely selfish ends, instead of cultivating peaceful relations, in a land they reside in, thanks only to the concessions others have made, on their behalf. Perhaps a bit more humility, gratitude, & compassion would have resulted in a better outcome?"
2,why in the hell are we responsible for israels military budget? let them pay for their own stuff...

1,"""Liberals, progressives, Democrats and other rational thinkers must accept one crucial reality if they are to save America's democracy: Those who live in the right-wing echo chamber really do believe what they are being told. Those beliefs are now extensions of their core identities...

And as anyone who's watched Fox knows, its fundamental message is rage at what liberals are doing to our country. Over the years the specific message has changed with the times — from terrorism to open borders to Benghazi to Christian cake bakers to critical race theory — but it's always about what liberal politicians are doing to cripple America, usually with a large dose of thinly veiled racism to give it emotional heft...

The Fox pipeline is pretty simple. Fox News stokes a constant sense of outrage among its base of viewers, largely by highlighting narratives of white resentment and threats to Christianity. This in turn forces Republican politicians to follow suit. It's a positive feedback loop that has no obvious braking system, and it's already radicalized the conservative base so much that most Republicans literally believe that elections are being stolen and democracy is all but dead if they don't take extreme action."" - Unknown"

Nobody said it's not getting funded it's just not going to be funded with this bill then with the other bill later when it's already been approved with the defense bill that going to be passed in December

Trump was the first and only U.S. President to abandon our allies on the field of battle, abandon a U.S. base and turn them both over to our arch enemy Russia, who rolled in the next day. Trump got no Kurds out of Syria, not one. The ISIS prisoners then released following this betrayal were quite likely some of the same ones who later planned the attack and killed 13 U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.

2,"I rather resent not knowing how people afford children, homes, and cars."
1,"Congressional democrats are corporate Plutocrats, just like republicans, and will not tax wealth because they are part of the 1%. Duh"
2,I don’t know what she is but for sure not a Democrat
0,I hope I can live long enough to vote for a real Democrat in her next primary election.
2,The lesson: reverse Citizens United!
2,This does nothing for those of us that don’t have children!!!!!
0,Trump & the spineless Republicans ruin the economy ohh and try to destroy democracy. Trump left us with a 7.8trillion bill. They afraid for their rich buddies getting tax now.
2,Neither party stands up for working people. One is just marginally less grotesque than the other.
2,"a better question is why do we work so hard to elect democrats to a majority when all they do is fight with each other and fail to get any significant laws passed? i.e. infrastructure;
voting rights."
2,"Time for all politicians to wear clothing showing their sponsors, much like race car drivers!"
1,Democrats in control of congress and not once have we heard anything about gutting Citizens United. I wonder why...hmmmm
2,She should be prosecuting for accepting bribes - - because that’s what it is.
0,"The closer to ""conservative"" politicians get, the easier they are to buy. Actually, all politicians spend way too much time ""fund raising"". We should really have publicly funded races, and laws that (when elected) politicians can't own stock, accept donations from anything other than individuals, and regulate lobbying. Government is supposed to work for the people, not the super rich and not for big corporations."
1,So why did Gov. Newsom divert money intended for Forrest management for something else? And why hasn't he addressed the water needs of the state? He doesn't know how to prepare ahead of time for these crisis.
2,This is why Insulinis $300 a pan in the United States. And $125 a pound overseas. Isn’t that awful patriotic of them . They said they sell it for a competitive price
2,"Both parties get paid by the same people. The reason most people vote for Democrats is that they are not Republicans. The reason most other people vote for Republicans is that they are not Democrats. The working class can not be allowed to win. That's why weren't allowed the opportunity to vote for Bernie Sanders and when we did, it was ignored. We are all left voting for the party we hate the least. You won't find the tools to gain your freedom in the master's house."
2,"When will we stop allowing our representatives
to be bought off? Obviously, she will never vote for a bill to reduce the prices charged by drug companies! I'm sure there are many other companies out there, i.e. health care corporations, that have bought off our reps so they are immune from any changes to the laws!"
2,"So, my son had a minor accident. No damage, just a bruised shin. 24 hours in the hospital. No drugs used. Bill? $41,000. This is the scandal. We don’t really see what hospitals and doctors charge. Wake up."
2,"moderate dem=Evil repub=NAZI!!!!!
!!!!!"
2,She needs to go. She does not represent the people and needs to go!
2,This is another heffer who should be removed from office.
2,This has to stop! Big Pharma is destabilizing the financial well being of the 98%! Our financial well being is at stake! As consumers we demand the ability to purchase RX drugs from reliable approved world market sources at reasonable prices like the rest of the planet!
1,"No one FORCES an ABORTION...but YOU want to FORCE a vaccine? My body, MY CHOICE...or isn't it!! Sit Down!!"
2,Probably because they would have to pay more in taxes.
2,"They make so when a lobbyist comes along offering them millions in perks, it's hard to say no. Our government has a pay structure well-suited to the 1970's, but now it's simply too far behind the scale of what these folks could make in the private sector. A lot of people think we pay our elected officials too much, but the problem is that we don't pay them enough to not take lobbyist money."
0,You're what I'd call a closet Republican.
2,Codify this law now!
0,"I read today the deficit was 7.8 trillion. When are the Democrats going to realize the Republicans are playing them. There is no intention of the republicans agreeing to anything for the present, they are looking at the future. You can see that in what Trump is doing by supporting all these people in state positions dealing with elections, if the the elections in the future is very close. Your dealing with some very nasty, corrupt individuals, that will stop at nothing, to cheat to win. An example is the last Supreme Court judge that shows how evil they are. Again they have cheated in the past when they didn't have the votes and changed it to 50 votes to win. You never trust Moscow Mitch McConnell and you should know that by now. You want to do something positive, start getting the people in the Republican Party with all the criminal activity they have done in the last plus decade. Get them removed from office and put in prison if possible. There supporters don't care how corrupt Trump and the Republicans are. The more corrupt they are the better they like it. You saw who supports them and the type of people they are. It's going to be interesting how hard the punishment will be for the people that were arrested for the insurrection, who was involved in the planning, and weapons that were used to murder the people that lost their life and the type of injuries that caused their wounds. The intent was to do bodily harm to anyone in their way of the attack."
2,"What happened to the billions we voted for and approved for new and expanded water storage??? Yeah,,,, didn't happen, did it!?"
2,Citizen’s United is just grand…. Until the people rein in the largess and dark money we will continue to see examples of corruption that they (politicians) continue to participate in
2,This is what taking bribes is all about. The US will never get better with grifters in positions of power.
1,Ok but what about the way Biden pulled out and left people behind did not her you talk about that Robert Reich
1,Vote her the hell out. She’s a “turncoat” Democrat anyway. Now we find out that she’s “on the take” too.
2,Because the rich are paying them off.
1,"Then allow our right to choose a vaxclne or not.

You can’t have it both ways.

No poison for me, thank you anyways."
2,The only way I see us taking our government back from the hand me down billionaires and greedy corporations is if enough tax payers band together and threaten to not pay their taxes.

2,"Still waiting for those firefighting airplanes we already paid for.
And we never got anything from the water reservoir money previously allocated.
So why should we trust you?"
0,"Why, oh why, when Moscow Mitch goes on air to tell the nation he will not raise the debt ceiling, doesn’t someone in the background say, in a VERY LOUD VOICE……”Why not…you did it three times for Trump, you worthless “censored”, “censored”, piece of trash!! Call him out."
0,In my opinion these people aren’t Dems… they’re wolves in sheep’s clothing. I’ve said for years that that’s how they will infiltrate the party and then work to dismantle from the inside. They’re no more trustworthy than the Russians or the Chinese. They know full well that they can’t win the public vote fair and square and cheating is their go to method now.
2,"So if they already took the bribes, does that mean they’re locked in and have to vote against the common good? Their constituents need to bombard them with messages to move them to do the right thing, or else."
2,If the debt ceiling needs to be explained to you every year Senator you should resign. because you obviously need to rest at home.
2,Thank you Senator!!!!!
0,"They are afraid of the GOP and the American News Networks. They are virtually anti-society, anti-Social Democrat anti-people."
2,"How are we ever going to put a stop to this revolving door cycle of influence in politics? They write the bills, and Congress rubber stamps them into law, and pocket's the cash. Disgraceful."
2,"Let’s! Certainly power used and abused by our so-called public servants in Congress should be reviewed. So far from the notion of service it’s almost unrecognizable!
An example from ActTv post today re: Joe Manchin…In legislating when someone says let’s slow things down on this bill they mean “I want to kill it but I want to take the time to enjoy doing it.”😷🇺🇸"
2,Because they get paid off just as much as Republicans in regard to corperate donors.
2,"The 'debt "" is in the form bonds, 80% of which are held by Americans."
0,We have to do something about republican stalemates and Mitch
2,"Disappointing. When Sinema was elected, in Arizona of all places, I was hopeful for the future of our democracy. Now it appears she’s all show and no substance on actual progressive issues. She’s a moderate Republican, not a Democrat at all."
2,How dare they protect innocent human lives!!!!
2,"Because taxing wealth hits the poor and middle class worst. Robert ,you are tge dumbest person on the planet ,arent you."
2,Wealthy politicians like tax breaks too

2,And some of our politicians have the audacity to talk about greed and corruption in other countries? While they fatten their pocket with corporate money to do their bidding!!
0,"From a democratic CA constituent: RETIRE.
We have supported your ability to be in office longer than most. Your cognitive abilities are compromised, this is crazy. Diane do the NOBLE thing. It’s ridiculous to keep office as a procedural choice. You are not a true representation of what you used to be. Knowing Gavin Newsom won the recall election in stride - you could allow your Democratic replacement to have an opportunity to affect real change in our nation during this very critical time. While you can tend to your retirement and health needs."
2,Because they are all owned by wealthy backers
2,They don’t have to worry about their families health bill what’s for ever after all the money the pockets from everywhere who car about others is their policy's.

0,"Sorry but there is no Constitutional right to abortion care. Our founding Fathers did not write that in the Constitutional.
But they did write the 2nd admendent to keep the goverment from taking our arms."
1,50 years ago we thought it was a blob. We know better now. It is inhumane butchery to abort a living feeling person that literally tries to get away from the blade. This is indefensible now that we know.

Shameful including the SCOTUS."

2,Because Republicans and Democrats are both bought off
0,"A woman’s right to choose to have an abortion has been settled law for nearly 50 years. AND TURNED IT TO ORGAN HARVESTING!! I believe abortion is wrong!!

2,They are on their way to being wealthy
1,"Our country is falling apart. The border is a HUGE BREACH. Why is the Government allowing ILLEGALS for all over the world into our COUNTRY ILLEGALLY???

This is UNCONSTITUTIONA

0,"We must realize Republicans give most of the money go their friends and cronies for their own use. They do not ever find necessities for people poorer then themselves. This Pandemic has definitely proved certain facts and having no money for the sick, the poor, the hungry, the homeless during the Republicans wrong in that when money has been given to individuals they have been spending it wisely for necessities rather than their being extravagant. They have been looking after their families, trying to pay for their housing despite climate change, Democrats show up for the people in need. They don't go on vacation , show up at the border, try to remedy during hurricanes, visit veterans try to help them out, try to pass infra structure bills so we get jobs, now you tell me what have we gotten from Republicans until this pass year? Unless we go to golf courses, baseball and football games, posh dinners,mostly,
we'll never know especially if it happens on the weekend.@"

1,"It's so hard to post controversial items on this senator's FB page. So I decided to INVADE and INTERRUPT this current string topic.Here's Gianna Jessen, (link) a rare survivor of this moral ABOMINATION that your senator championed when voting AGAINST Senate Bill 311: If it had passed, it would have protected the sometimes FULL-TERM survivors of infanticide abortions; abortions which are done WITHOUT anesthesia for the infant. If you read your senator's FB page, then you need to know about/"
2,These 'donations' are nothing but bribes and should be totally illegal.
2,"why would this be hard to understand? You support the people that support you.
Politicians are supported by rich people, politicians are supporting them.
They won't support the average american until we provide a better method of support than rich people do"
2,There is nothing in there to prevent future issues…. forest management would go a long way to protect against wildfire and increase ground water supply… however you don’t want to solve problems just enable them
2,The lesson I see is there are crooks on both sides of the isle.
2,You're not even a real Republican
2,"We allow this st.
Our safeguards against graft are nonexistent ."
2,These members of our government are accepting Bribes which is a criminal offense. This is illegal no matter what you call it. 😡
2,You are not serving any of your constituents from any party at all if you aren’t at least working to find reasonable solutions in these areas.
2,Because they will be taxed too
2,"You have been FACT checked and found 100% FALSE. A supreme ct ruling is NOT ""settled law."" ONLY congress -- with the consent of the governed -- can make law if the SC makes setteld law then ""Plessy v Ferguson,"" ""Dred Scott v. Sanford,"" ""Korematsu v. United States,"" would still be law

Diane you're a DOPE."

1,Lol at democrats concerned over the debt
2,And now the billionaires are trying to make a 5th branch of army called space something. Give me a break. Let’s get things taken care of here first.
2,"That sounds like bribery, pure and simple, to me. How it can be legal is beyond me. It's like if a big company, pharma or oil company, were going to be judged in court and were slipping the judge large sums of money before hand. Actually mind boggling that no bill has been introduced to end. Could it be so many are accepting payola that no one wants to see it end."
2,These politicians need to be primary and taken out of Government.
2,Some of y’all need to learn what “debt” truly means. (Hint:it’s not good. Republicans and Democrats are the same when it comes to spending our money like there’s no tomorrow.)
2,Neither stand for regular people. The democrats always say they are going to but when we all work together to get them in positions of power they do nothing but whine.

2,What disgrace. You shouldn't be in congress. Lying to the people that elected you. Just to get elected and then turn coat once you're there. Greedy people.
2,"Can we stop pretending that any democrats are anything other than ""moderates"""
0,This is why Sinema votes against everything the Democrats try to pass. This is also why she and Manchin vote against getting rid of the filibuster... They care less about America and change. They should both be Republicans because they follow McConnell's lead. Getting rid of the filibuster is the only way to make change in the voting rights.
2,remember the supreme court said it was ok for corporations to donate as much money as they wanted...the long game is coming to fruit
2,We just got our tax return this week
2,"Surprise, surprise….our very own Congress has been bought by corporate America! Wonder how long this has been going on?"
2,"We need to reverse Citizens United, and cap corporate donations to sitting politicians."
1,Because Democrats are massive rich and hypocrites...
0,"Seems to me that is because they are demonized for it by the republicans. The Republicans always convinced people that Democrats are not just taxing the rich, but that they will be taxing lower incomes also. It seems to work every time."
2,"Dianne..comment

1,"Raising the debt limit authorizes Treasury (or is it the Federal Reserve Bank? hell if I know) to run the dollar bill printing press an hour more. If Democrats were serious about defending the dollar (and they ain't even serious about defending the cost of tea in China), they'd be cutting income tax rates (causing money to move out of tax-shelters) and taxing the royal dickens out of crude oil instead."

2,Dems and Reps getting money from pharma must be voted out.
2,And start with the anti-democracy folks attending Davos and corrupting the world.
2,What we need to do is outlaw lobbyists!
2,Big Money owns us. Corporations should not be able to contribute to campaigns and there should be a cap on what individuals can contribute.

Just because you are rich and BIG that makes you powerful? Do you know that same hole that the poor are buried in, the rich have to live in that same hole!!!! The hold you will live your eternal life in, it is not lined with gold and silver and all your precious stones, houses, camps, boats, 3 wheelers and 4 wheelers and your big boats!!! no no, they are not.

You said your kids and family would get it.....AND!!!! You will not see it! You will not come back and pull on their toes if they don't do it like you said......You will be DEAD! Gone and not returning......
.Just remember how greedy you are and your selfishness of the things that God has allowed you to own and have......How your greed and selfishness has set you apart from the love of God's Children. How those material things have divided the world, that you may claim you are living in your own world...wrong!!
! The world you living in belongs to God, not your.....You did not create it and you cannot keep it.......How rich are you and how you feel at the end of the day with you greed? Do you know what love is? Have you ever experience the love of the Lord in your life, your kids lives, your wife's life, your family? The love of money is the root of all evil.....What do you plan to do with the wealth that God has entrusted you with? Do you plan to share it with people in the love of God or your love? Because if it is not the love of God, that love is fake and a lie. Choose this day whom you will serve, the God of the wealth and famous or Jehovah God? Foe me, whether what I have, I will serve My Jehovah God with everything. How about you?

That’s not an economic subsidy. It’s federal programs that every American pays into and every American is entitled to draw from. The alternative is that an American worker is less worthy of social security (as a concept) based on where they live, which is stupid frankly. 

Happy to link the Rockefeller institutes research on this topic, which shows exactly what you would expect… that a map of federal spending per capita is identical to a map of per capita elderly Americans, poverty, and disability rates.

0,"Age should also be measured starting at conception, then. Birthdays are now Conception Days. All human rights apply at six weeks of age. Men who beat their wives or otherwise induce miscarriage will be persecuted for first degree manslaughter in addition to domestic violence charges. Half of all medical costs paid by the father begins at six weeks. They will need to be added to health care coverage plans as well. No need for birth certificates there will now be Conception Identification with only a number until other information is obtained. Can a person legally not have a name? If not- you must be named as soon as conception is confirmed. As a zygote is now *life* a new *possible life* will likely be recognized. As such, male masturbation will be closely monitored and prohibited as it does not occur without external stimulation. Sex without procreative intent will be discouraged and you can bet birth control will be next to go. Any age restricted right will be measured from conception, obviously. The definition of life will need revision. Basic science and the seven characteristics of life no longer apply. So many nonliving things just became living. I’m not sure about this one but if the pregnancy or childbirth kills the mother doesn’t that make the person responsible the fetus? How would that work? Anyways- point is this whole idea is a stupid front for punishing and controlling women. You can bet that the rich will be getting abortions for their wives and the other poor women they knock up.

Teachers might do well to abandon that label and lose the thought that they are creating revolutionaries and stick to the facts: we stole and abused countless humans, and taught our children to hate and oppress said humans based on the color of their skin, and it took us more than two and a half centuries to begin to address the legacy of violence and hatred we created. Those are facts. 

That, and many of our most notable white inventors were likely to have been on the autism spectrum: Einstein, Tesla, even Jefferson.  If some of the newly minted eductors would ditch the inflammatory rhetoric, quit giving bonus points for protest attendance, stuck to the grim truths of American history, and taught critical thinking instead of trying to piss people off, this country might get somewhere.

For one, caucasians are way too broad of a group.  You wouldn't say blacks have a lot of blood on their hands after what happened in Rwanda.

Secondly, it's not right to pass the responsibility of a previous generation's actions onto the next.  No one should feel guilt or shame just because of the color of their skin.

1,"He's right though,  saying white people have blood on their hands because  the actions of people in the past or some people in the present is as racist as assuming black people as a group are responsible for the few black people who commit a disproportionate amount of violent crime, or blaming men for the few who commit a disproportionate amount of rape.

And white privilege  might exist, but the overly simplified heuristic that is used when discussing white privilege deeply flawed. One can't assume that just because  someone is white, they are automatically  privileged. There are so many many variables involved that may increase, decrease, or nullify any actual  privilege that just talking about it in such broad terms of all white people compared to all minorities as privileged or oppressed is completely useless and ultimately causes more conflict than help resolve anything."

Look, white privilege isn't always what happens but what doesn't happen to you, because you're automatically assumed to be innocent or not worthy of suspicion, etc.

2,"The view you hold of white privilege is one I held for a long time.  What it isn't saying is that white people have easy lives or no problems or an automatically easier life than people of color.  Unfortunately, that's how some people talk about it.

I grew up white in a small, poor, rural, farming town.  Lots of meth, lots of poverty, things were bad.  There was a lot of resentment to the idea of white privilege because, as you say, there are lots of levers and dials on how privileged someone is.  

White privilege is the truth that, if one of those people were black, their life would be harder and they would have to deal with more issues than they do currently.  It ISN'T taking away or minimizing what those people are going through.  It is acknowledging race is one of the bigger levers in the equation."

2,"Cryptocurrencies have no legal basis.  The Constitution places sole authority over currency in Congress - not in Elon Musk, not in some mysterious Japanese man with his Chinese coin mining facility. 

Do you even know why we have devaluation in the dollar?  Do you know how fiat currency actually works and the global coordination of currency markets?  

We had moderate to mild inflation for several decades until Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1970, which crashed the economy throughout the 70s.  Yet, we still managed to have no carry over debt for programs - even Vietnam.  But in the 70s, we started borrowing money like crazy from Japan, to the point where  a minister of education suggested we cede Hawaii to them in exchange for writing off the debt. 

Carter used monetarism to increase inflation significantly which lowered the value of the dollar to repay the Japanese their dollar indexed funds.  This decrease the amount we owed them by billions of dollars.  Yes, stagflation: double digit interest rates, double digit inflation and double digit unemployment.  Short term pain (like 8 years) for long term gain of not carrying foreign debt. 

But Congress couldn't control its spending, and decided to leverage the funds in social security instead.  Throughout the 80s and 90s that's where we borrowed from thus increasing the total debt.  Various members of Congress then opined mightily about the impending crash of Social Security and that it should be privatized, like Chile did.  Except, Chile's program crashed and burned. 

We've been borrowing money for 40 years.   Mysterious, uncontrolled digital currency won't change anything other than create yet another ponzi scheme where the people who get in first, profit and the people who get in late lose money.   With no transparency and no accountability - that's what crypto is: it's a Ponzi scheme."
2,"I'm sensing that your concern starts and ends with you. So maybe that 75% Dem might be a little high, huh?"
2,Why is it unfortunate 75% of your beliefs align with the Democrat party?
2,The only way nations will roll with crypto is to issue their own.
0,I’m not even a huge Warren fan but I’ll certainly trust her opinion and guidance over some random neck beard on Twitter. And what exactly is the “crypto narrative”?
2,"

Of course do your own due diligence, I too wouldn't have suspected her until I started seeing references to this across many crypto news sites. I'm not saying that regulation doesn't need to be there, I'm just saying doomsayer democrats regarding cryptocurrencies will drive Republicans to take advantage of the narrative as being the ""free financial"" party. Granted, that's probably 10 to 20 years down the road, but politics is always a long game played like it's short."
2,It already is one gigantic Ponzi scheme right now in which WS and Musk are pushing.
0,"Anecdotal and a false equivalency.

Just because some people use it criminally does not make it inherently bad for the overall financial system. People money launder, commit fraud and cheat at the stock market all the time using USD fiat. 

That's like saying, Marijuana is bad because heroine users have used it. It's literally the same argument Republicans have used before."
2,"I don't really care what percentage of democratic or republican I am. I don't subscribe to the idea that I need to be either or. Ultimately you impress upon me the validation for that, with that kind of gatekeeping rhetoric. 

What I am saying, is I watch historical trends and compare them to current events. It might not happen, but the current dialogue of in office political figures is that it's a growing concern and lines in the sand will soon be drawn. What Ultimately will help people who are pro crypto vote for a specific political party is where their stance on crypto is."
2,My concern is the backing. There isn't a treasury or standard backing the currency. Theoretically I see it as kids honoring monopoly money
2,"Firstly, I want to say thank you for being kind and respectful. I knew this post would be met with ire and aggressiveness. 

But to your point of backing, our current USD isn't backed by anything other than the trust and psychological agreedness that it equals x amount. Money is an arbitrary meaning just like lines in the dirt mean that a country, ""exists"" there. Granted, symbolism is EXTREMELY valuable. Symbolism has been used for great evil and great good. 

My point ultimately is, doomsayers leave room for others to take up the mantle as champions of the crypto space."
2,"That actually isn't correct.  The dollar is backed by the US Government.   It's fiat around the world with more than 20 countries that use it as their currency. 

As one of the dominant currencies in global currency baskets, mismoves by Congress or the Federal Reserve can have catastrophic global consequences.    

About crypto?  Who owns it?  Who oversees it?  Nobody  We see Elon Musk quite reliably pumping Dogecoin with a few weeks at the end of his fiscal quarter, and then dumping it a week after the books close.  

Bitcoin is heavily used by terrorists around the world for ransomware.  The mythical value is the anonymity, yet governments are showing success at seizing wallets used for crime.    Speaking of criminal terrorists, North Korea is one of the leading countries that use crypto for criminal activity.

If you lose all value in your crypto, the way it has happened to many people - who do you deal with to get partial indemnification or a refund?

Nobody.  Nobody.  This is exactly the model that caused multiple financial collapses in the United States from 1830 through 1880.  Five complete financial collapse, bank runs and depressions that lasted for years. 

Because of these collapses, we created the Federal Reserve to oversee currency and debt.  The closest we've come to a collapse was 2008 because of speculative investments.  Sound familiar?  That cost us more than $1 trillion to bring under control.

We have the FDC which exists to oversee financial institutions to protect consumers in the event of a collapse.  No crypto is FDC backed, meaning - a collapse in any crypto leaves it's investors without recourse, and no government backing means they'll never see a cent of it again.

That's why we don't support crypto  It's the subprime mortgage of financial instruments."
2,"My point exactly, USD is backed by the conglomerate agreedness that the US government will catch us if we fall. Just because USD is backed by the government doesn't make it's value any less psychological. 

If I say, my rock is more valuable because 1000 people find it valuable, does it make it any more valuable than the 500 people who think their rock has more value? Inherently no, because they both have psychological value not actually valuable. 

People made the same argument when we made the move away from gold backed USD. A new medium of exchange is necessary for a global economy to evolve. Using the empire of the United states of America as a basis for a financial system globally won't work forever."
2,"Unfortunately this is typical absolutism. The USD is run through every world nation and backed by 20 governments and trillions of dollars, and losses can be compensated.

Crypto *runs* based on wide psychological trust which you try to present as similar, but the scale is not even close. Further, Crypto is not backed by anybody. Lost wallets are not redeemed, stolen data, fraudulent exchanges can not be fought. When Bitcoin had its big early pop and exchanges promised to refund you in their shop's virtual currency rather than dollars, there was nothing you could do."
2,If nobody wanted to value the USD that'd be insane as economies would collapse but in the end the US Treasury would honor it. Not so with your rock.
2,What do you expect. Two of them have been accused of sexually assaulting women.
0,"I like beer….but I don’t like Kavanaugh. I also don’t like religious zealots on our court. 

And that’s without getting into Anita Hill.

That’s three out of the five pictured.

Two of the three are deeply flawed individuals and the third is an evangelical zealot.

Yep… it’s time for a broader representation of our people."
2,These five are a disgrace and betrayed the Constitution they SWORE to uphold. They are scumsucking liars.
0,"Kavanaugh is monumental black eye on the Court. His confirmation hearings, and the investigation that was hampered, eroded my faith in the supreme court. I didn't like the ultra conservatives, but that was fundamental disagreement over policies and morals. Brett kavanaugh perjured himself, I'm not even talking about the allegations of sexual misconduct. I'm talking about his ridiculous answers about his drinking and comments he made when he was a kid. 

The fact that one of nine heads of our entire judicial system, which is premised on getting to the truth and requiring people to tell the truth, would lie and be so evasive during his hearing has eroded my faith in this institution."
2,And one of them is an attempted rapist.
0,I believed Anita Hill.
1,Isn’t the far left a literal accused rapist himself and the bitch next to him was literally a handmaiden to a cult. This is crazy.
2,Two of those are sexual abusers.  The irony.
2,The Supreme Court is no longer credible or respectable as an institution.

Fuck RBG for not retiring when she should have

Fuck Stephen Breyer for being just a selfish

0,Four of them were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote
0,Kavanaugh should be impeached for lying under oath repeatedly. Barret shouldn’t be there at all. Democrats screwed the pooch on this and are doing nothing about it.
2,"SERIOUS QUESTION

Doesn't this just open the door for Republicans to dominate legislature and pack the courts when they're in charge?"
2,"Page 9 lines 13 thru 16 specifically say they can not. Laws still bullshit, but at least call it that for reasons it is not false ones."
2,"I read in the statute - rapists aren't allowed to receive the money, but they have to be convicted in order to be disqualified."
0,Balance the court! (...or Repair the Tampering) scans better than 'Pack the Court!'
0,"I will say I think we are lucky Trump decided to appoint Gorsuch rather than a more mainstream conservative- I've been pleasantly surprised by a number of his decision where he bucked the conservative wing of the court and sided with the liberals, mostly when American Indian rights were on the line. Only one of these I have an ounce of respect for despite my disappointment with a number of his other decisions.

With that said we really do need to end the filibuster and expand the court by 2 or so seats, whether permanently or only temporarily as has been done in the past."
0,Welp most are tRump appointees sooooooo raping “never knew her” and “damn it I love beer”
2,"I'm tired of screaming this. It's long past time.

0,Guys they didn’t make a decision on it. The Texas law will most likely be struck down when it goes through the proper process
0,We must pack the Supreme court.
1,"Yet, Democrats show no willingness to be bold when in power.

Republicans take their minority to execute their vision, enact whatever they can…hold up nominations. Yet, little shits like Manchin bitch and moan about bipartisanship. Wake up you senile POS, bipartisanship only exists when Democrats are in power"
2,This is too kind.   There are some 74 million people in America who favor this outcome.
2,Wow 4 white “educated” individuals and a man who shouldn’t be around a judges seat
2,"Serious question... Doesn't this almost encourage rape?

You rape and have a potential to win 10 grand?"
0,The court's already been packed.  4 of then were appointed by Presidents that lost popular vote.  One of them holds a clearly stolen seat and another violated the dieing wishes of their predecessor.  This court has no legitimacy.  Dems should correct the court.
2,Trump lives with These 5
0,"Is it just me, but does Kavanaugh have a tiny ass mouth compared to his head"
2,"Can anyone site a source? I’ve looked up but I can’t find anything. I’m assuming it’s included in Texas’s new abortion law which outlaws abortions after six weeks, no exceptions."
0,"WTF? I'm irish, and I sometimes can't believe what I see the US do. How backwards do you have to be to introduce a law like this."
2,Just add one justice. Should be enough to stop this bullshit without being accused of packing it to tilt the court.
2,"Wait I know Kavanaugh was accused, who else was?"
0,"A mere 9 people, the majority of whom are right wing religious fascists, representing 330 MILLION is asinine. 

It is beyond time to expand the court. Why aren’t we doing this?!"
2,"The supreme court hasn't been a valid entity since Garland was denied his rightful seat.

0,The Supreme Court also defended the internment of people during WW2. They've had a long history of ugly decisions.
0,"I'm old enough to remember when we had a 5-4 liberal majority on the SCOTUS.  It seems so fucking obvious how much the courts matter, but no matter how many times I say it, people just seem to refuse to get it.  I recall in 2016 so many people who didn't like Clinton saying things like, ""Quit trying to hold the court for ransom."""
2,Or didn't vote at all.

0,You also can't sue the woman who had the abortion.  Only those who aided and abetted her.
0,"And considering how infrequently rape is successfully prosecuted, particularly in Texas..."
0,"1.  Volunteer with your local chapter of the Democratic party.  Party planks and platforms are often written by the small number of people who bother to show up.  Having been involved with local democratic politics throughout my teens and early adulthood (I've had to stop since it's considered a conflict of interest with my current job) I can assure you, the people showing up are not always the people we want writing the party platform.  Most the people showing up have big financial interests in getting certain things done.  If we want democracy to work, we need to be more active in it.

2.  Vote in every election, especially at the local level.  The local level has huge influence on your day to day life, your vote carries more weight at the local level, and our next national level candidates have to get their start somewhere.  Voting in every election also means doing your homework.  Get to know the candidates.  For my most recent state delegate primary, I had a chance to talk with both the individuals on the ballot and got a solid feel for both.  It was clear the less funded guy was better to me, but he lost pretty decisively.  So few people do the homework so the woman with the slick mailers won.

3.  Run yourself.  As I already said, democracy only works if we work it.  If the people running aren't getting the job done, then someone else needs to step up.  And frankly, I'd rather vote for the reluctant candidate running to do the right thing than the person who really wants power.  I'm afraid of people who want power.

You'll notice my advice has nothing to do with this particular issue.  That's because if we don't get the foundation right, we will never be able to get the big stuff right.  It's all hard work I propose, no easy answers I fear."

2,"All of reddit is acting like they upheld the law, which isn't what happened"
2,"Reset the court. Mandate 3 Republican, 3 Dem, and 3 Independent judges. 

Each party elects their judges when one retires, the independents get added as they are now by the president"
1,Why do you think that is? Personally I think it’s because the Democratic Party here is designed to be nothing more than controlled opposition
0,It’s already been “Packed” by right wingers. It needs to be unpacked.
2,"Ignore posters like this, only trying to bring down enthusiasm to get out and VOTE!"
2,"Well said. Biden needs to UNPACK the court. They literally just adopt Republican framing and say “no it isn’t” absolutely hopeless. 

Democrats are supposed to be sophisticated and media savvy. Get yourself shit together Democrats.

If Biden added 3 more justices, Democrats would win re-election because of the courage and conviction of the move."
1,Yes no exceptions for rape and incest
2,"

A rapist could collect by suing his victim, as described in this post."
2,And how people feel the need to defend dirtbags like these. Good for you. They're trash. The way they voted proves it.
2,Because they care more about getting reelected.
0,"We don’t officially have a two or three party system. If republicans continue down the road to fascism and sane republicans branch out into a new party, you’re still stuck with fascists on the court and no provisions for the new protestant republicans. 

It also ignores proportions- independents would have a disproportionate representation."
0,"Married to Karen: [ In 2009, Thomas started Liberty Central, a conservative political advocacy nonprofit associated with the Tea Party movement.   
Thomas supported Donald Trump during his presidency, offering his administration recommendations on individuals to hire through her work with the conservative coalition Groundswell. Thomas made an early social media endorsement of the Trump rally that preceded the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol."
1,"I doubt if that pains you otherwise you wouldn't have brought it up. Does it pain you that the African-American community was split on Clarence Thomas with men supporting him and women supporting her? Or that other Democrats voted to confirm Thomas?

Of course not. Your goal was to smear the POTUS."
0,"Agreed. I'm more disgusted than anything. Barrett should have been a judge appointed by Biden. Same with Gorsuch with Obama. The Supreme Court would then be more representative of US. 

These three new judges are just shills for the Republicans."
2,He won't fucking retire while we have the Senate.
2,"That doesn't seem true. 

If they were in the Dems position, would you want them to remove the filibuster and pack the courts?"
2,"Both parties could have removed the filibuster many times. Neither did because of the concerns it raises when they are now in power.

I'm unconvinced they will, but if Dems remove it, they will overrun them entirely when they next have a slim majority."
2,"What stops an out of state telemedicine company simply posting the pills to somebody who wants an abortion?

1,Democratic leaders are doing that on their own. Don’t blame anyone else.
2,"The number of new justices needs to be even, to keep the total odd.

I have no remaining confidence that I can predict why someone would win the presidential election, just the same as I no longer understand what we're disagreeing over or where the center line is."
1,So Democrats are on board with Christo-fascism or is this about the so-called ‘moderates’ and independents? I say fck ‘em. This shit is dead serious. They get re-elected to a fascist country that’s about to do away with elections? Seems like a shortsighted take.
0,"You don't recognize the fascists. Sweep them all under the Republican label and you neuter their worst tendencies.

And just so you know, he was criticized for it back then."
2,"Maybe, but I critique Biden and I'm a supporter. It's healthy to disagree ☺️ n reasonable grounds."
0,"Why is criticism of Biden off limits. The man has made a lot of wrong choices in his career. No one is perfect, and the fact that the African American community was split on Thomas is irrelevant. 

Let’s just hope that Biden makes the right decision now and gets behind the movement to expand the court."
2,This is America- we still get to criticize our electeds
2,Did you sleep through the entire Trump administration? They've already done it.
2,"They refused to even confirm Obama's judges, but when Trump came, they approved judges with a rubber stamp."
2,"Because they didn't need to in order to pack the courts in their favor.  All they had to do was refuse to vote on Obama's elected judges, so they could give them to Trump.

If they'd needed to expand the courts to get them packed, they wouldn't have hesitated."

2,"We have to make it happen. The supreme court was willed into existence extra-constitutionally. We can will it into anything we want with the correct votes. Notably, this will not happen with either party in power pushing their own agenda. It has to be done when the court is evenly split"
2,"Yeah. It seems the party wants to “win” on their terms, only in certain ways they feel is appeasing. It is not good enough to win, they want to win while looking good and having broad communal support and that is simply not possible.

I see it in uber colleagues all the time. They want to win while feeling superior."
2,Haven’t heard a single “democratic leader” say the shit you’re saying.
2,No I'm with you. That was my cynicism speaking before. I mean I just can't think of any reason why the dems wouldn't fill the court with judges when they have complete control if not for their own worry over re-election... To yeah get the moderate and independant votes.
2,You missed the point of the example. If any party loses support and dies due to radicalism they still have huge representation in the court under your proposal.
0,I quite like Biden and I think you’re completely right. We’re not trump supporters who look at the president and think he’s gods gift to our cause. He’s a human and he makes mistakes. Hell Anita Hill herself endorsed him in the last election despite everything that happened back then.
0,"Just so you know, the African-American community was split on the Clarence Thomas nomination. Of course, you didn't mention that Biden and the other Democrats were caught in a difficult situation. You pretend Biden acted unilaterally and alone. Your goal is obvious: to casually smear Joe Biden."
0,"Too bad your claim wasn't reasonable, huh? Odd how you failed to mention that the African-American community was split on the Thomas nomination, huh?

But then your goal was to blame Biden. Mentioning the pressure put on him by African-American men wouldn't serve your purpose, would it?"
1,">Why is criticism of Biden off limits. 

Smears are not criticism. Nice try."
2,"It's not, but I don't exactly see why we need to bring up Biden's role in the Thomas nomination every time we point out what a shit head Thomas is.  It's like we're desperately trying to advance the both sides narrative.  Thomas is objectively worse than Biden in almost every conceivable way, and while Biden has gone on since those hearings to do good things, Thomas has been a thorn in the side of democracy, justice and basic human decency ever since.  

I see no value in flogging Biden at every opportunity for what he did 30 years ago."

I had never seen something so deeply unamerican in my life to that point."
0,"Of course Democrats want to ""win"", that's the whole job of a party and lawmakers. But they need to be strong, and stop pretending the GOP is there to help in good faith."

This Supreme Court is completely broken. It’s a bunch of crazy right wingers with an agenda to undo all of the progress that has been made in the last 100 years. The filibuster is already going to be the reason the dems will loose seats in 2022, and McConnell would have already gotten rid of it if the dems were doing the same thing. In my opinion Biden and the rest of the conservative dems need to grow a pair and get things done, or we are going to loose the country."

2,The tribal way of life in Afghanistan won.  We tried to force democracy and our beliefs on them for 20 years.  Kabul is the capital and largest city of Afghanistan. They couldn't convince the rest of the country to adopt a whole new world.  The country is tribal and Islam is the official religion of Afghanistan. That never changed.
1,"Someone needs to tell the Afghans freedom isn’t free. They ought to earn their own freedom through hardship, fight and sacrifice."
2,"You’re absolutely right. The reality in Afghanistan never changed. Both Karzai and Ghani have spent a large amount of the foreign aid to bribe tribal leaders or face their armed resistance. That’s the way Afghanistan runs, plain and simple. Obama should’ve left right after Bin Laden was eliminated and disregard Bush’s rebuilding mission that wasn’t the reason why we went there in the first place. Democracy is something nations have to fully understand and embrace or it’ll fail. The struggle in Rome after the assassination of Julius Caesar boiled down to pro-monarchy versus the supporters of the Republic. Democracy is an everlasting struggle that every generation must fight for."

Elder will not only give senate control to Republicans, but he will give us another Cruz, Rubio, Paul or *worse*.

People my not be Feinstein fans but the alternative is a piece of shit Republican.

Republicans can drop a meme about Venezuela and socialism and rally 50% of the electorate. Republicans now days appeal to fear of the other, nostalgia, and the base tendencies of their base. Their wins are supported by the remnants of the ‘good Republican’. 

Don’t expect anything to get better. Don’t expect a splinter party of traditional Republicans to emerge in a meaningful way and get the rank and file to ‘come to their senses’. 

The future is a dysfunctional, dystopian mess. Crappy roads, crumbling schools, bigger prisons, the endemic presence of Covid-19, and fewer rights for women and minorities.

0,The US is a two party system and the ideologies have changed over time. At the moment however republicans represent white supremacy and the fear that their power is declining. This ideology is not justifiable in any working society and you see this played out over and over. So to be a democrat at this moment means against that. Unfortunately that is the stark reality.
2,"In my opinion we are all independents. Dem or Republican are labels for the politicians. I like some ideas from both sides or at least I used to. Republicans like to control spending which I agree with. Only I think that spending control should all go toward the defense budget which gop loves to over inflate. 

From the things you said you liked, you are def more Democrat as Republicans actively want all those to go away.they hate unions. Hate regulations. Hate employee protections. Want no min wage. Want no osha. Want people working more hours and less days off. Democrats don't like big govt they think the govt should be there to help people when they need it and protect people when they can. Gop uses that to con people into saying dems want to control our lives. Which is what they want to do while claiming they are getting govt off people backs. Whatever that means. They want high taxes for the middle and lower class and no taxes for the rich. And they are almost all rich themselves while the Democrats have alot of ppl that were part of the working class before getting elected."

2,"Appreciate his bravery but it really is pointless to let your political views be known on liberal echo chambers like Twitter. Sad to see it cost him his job. Dont know much about the video game development world in terms of politics, but hopefully he can find work after this."
2,the more power you give these people the more lives they destroy over political disagreement. pure psychopaths
2,God will provide for this man. Good for him to help spread love and not hate.
2,We have to support people like this. We must provide a soft landing spot for people who get cancelled like this if we ever expect to win the culture war. We cannot continue to just let those brave enough to support our side wither and die when the mob comes after them.
1,So the takeaway is don't have an opinion unless it lines up with the crooked left Nazi Germany.
2,That’s messed up. We are being silenced for anything.
1,"At this point there can't be any reconciliation. The left wants things inherently un American, has a serious lack of morals, and revels in destruction and indoctrination.  Read any subs here about politics or anything for that matter, and Twitter, and see how truly vile the left is. They aren't liberals anymore. They're leftists."
1,That’s terrible I swear these leftist and huge companies are afraid of a issue that shouldn’t be in question. Snowflakes at the finest. Smh
2,"It’s sad that these losers are canceling people for supporting life! 
It’s okay to wish death on people for not being vaccinated though! SMH"
1,Baby killing seems so important to a part of our society
2,So much for freedom of speech.......
2,We need to publicly shame that company which is obviously run by Nazis.
2,This Abortion law has to have an exception for rape victims or underage girls. Otherwise it’ll get taken down.
1,"Remember when almost everyone condemned abortion and being pro-life wasn't controversial. I was called ""edgy"" for supporting this man. No I just didn't throw away my moral compass and still understand the difference between right and wrong. 
  When you're championing the murder of innocents as a sacred right and so happy satanist are trying to protect your cause you might want to try and find that compass.."
2,"I tray don’t appreciate this cancel culture, if we were more open to discussion we could just talk about how bad that Texas law is."

1,"Exactly, try speaking the truth about anything on the Democrats Sub here and see what happens"
1,The left is happy for you to voice an opinion - as long as it is theirs.
1,More like communist
1,"I wish we as a group got angry enough to start doing that to them. ""Wait, this CEO just shared that if you die of COVID and didn't get the vaccine that it's good? They wished death on these people? We want them fired!""

Not that canceling is good, but maybe if we started doing it to them then they can agree with us and form a majority that frowns upon canceling and maybe it will finally stop."
2,I actually wish this could have waited til after the midterms. I just feel they will use this as their justification for stacking the court. If that happens this country is in for a freefall
1,"No it doesn't. Nor does it have to have ""exceptions for life of the mother"" either. The latter is the only possibly compelling exception and even then it falls flat on its face because in no other realm is failure to medically save (in this case the baby) applicable to murder. 

You cannot fail to save with malice aforethought and despite taking every reasonable action still murder the person. That's just nonsense because the malice aforethought part is contradictory to the actions trying to save another. Doctors aren't perfect and fail to save people all the time and it's not murder. So why would it be any different for the unborn child that you suggest abortion be legal so that they can be killed? It doesn't make sense. Either the child is going to die regardless what you do and you can save the mother, or the child lives and the mother lives.

So no, the law doesn't need to make any exceptions for this. If you murder the child, you should be punished. Period."
2,"> This is a standard across the board for people in tthe public eye who have a company backing them.

Much like actors and actresses, and owners of tech companies."
1,"I agree, but it's incredibly frustrating that if you hold liberal views you're free (and even sometimes rewarded) for being as loud about them as possible.

Company leaders (who inherently represent all working under them) should keep political opinions to themselves regardless of where they fall on the political spectrum, but that condition is currently only half true."
1,So its better that kids be murdered than orphaned? Thats kinda warped..

Learn things."
1,"It's clear you're not a Republican so you can be on your way, now."
1,You don't need to be religious to believe a fetus is a human being.... wtf lol
2,This isn't overreach at all. Even the provision of using the civil courts to enforce it isn't overreach. It does the next best thing possible to calling it murder like it should be and enforcing it by state law enforcement: It puts the enforcement in the hands of the people instead of the state or federal government.
2,Agree but I always ask how are they only 51% of the votes then? Must be rural v urban thing.
1,"Ha it doesnt even need to be a political sub. It could be... About puppy dogs. Someone makes a political comment on a picture of a husky puppy that is related to democratic ideology. You answer with your conervative ideology, you get banned.

Or a chance in general. The next bill gates. The next Candace Owens. The next Ron Desantis. Would you like to further more explain why you feel this way?
1,"They still won't get the court packing. They know they'll lose big time if they pack the court. They're already up against the redistricting and the increased security against exploiting mail in voting in several of the swing states they used to put Biden in, the first midterm after a president's first term is the hardest to maintain for the president's party and the president is already in hot water with the whole Afghanistan debacle. Plus if Harris gets 25thed into the white house between now and then, it's even worse because everybody will be coming out to stop her. That's why Biden only did the commission instead of just nominating new justices. Also Pelosi's commission isn't really moving very well. Even the social media platforms, facebook included are starting to regret propping up the democrats because now they want to come after them with regulations not to make them uphold free speech which they were afraid of under Trump, but to censor more than they can handle without hurting their bottom line. Add to that people's weariness with the pandemic and the flipflopping of government officials on what actions need to be taken to mitigate COVID and it looks less and less good for the Democrats.

The US is a shitshow right now."
2,"It does though, It doesn't have rape and incest, which is ick, but it does have a mother's life clause or whatever"
1,"That's because it doesn't actually have to. Failing to save an unborn baby because we're unable to do so is not abortion. That's a miscarriage, even if facilitated by surgery to remove the child from a fallopian tube. The child is guaranteed to die in that case and so it's not murder to save the mother's life by removing the child whole from the mother and allowing that to happen without killing the mother."
0,"Started out very eloquently but kinda did a bit of mental gymnastics there. Thank you for your opinion. So is it safe to say a 13 year old rape victim should follow through with pregnancy even if it kills her?

Edit: spelling"

2,"It's no more likely to kill her than an adult woman actually, but regardless, yes. If a medical emergency arises just like in an adult woman, then medical staff should treat both as patients and try to save both."
2,I will vote and I will pay attention to the news but I am done putting the news on a pedestal in my life. Not long ago my day shifted based on how bad the news was and every day it was bad so my days were all bad. Eventually I just decided to leave the room when the news is on and only read off of this subreddit. I’m still keeping my eyes open to the possibilities but now I’m slowing down on the politics. Now i sadly watch my dad fall deeper and deeper into this political hole and lose care for everything.
1,"That is an interesting question and I think you are seeing the statements that conservatives typically make regarding individual liberty (i should be able to make my own decisions because I am free to do so, I just have to deal with the consequences of that decision) and relating it to this issue. Is that the case? I'm sorry if it isn't, that's just the connection that I see and would appreciate clarification if I'm incorrect. 
I think the distinction is that we regard the pregnant woman and the unborn baby as individuals with inherent value simply because they are human. That idea has ramifications. We believe both of those individuals have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. So because the baby is a living individual, it has a right to life and should be provided that as much as we are able. Additionally, the destruction of a life, which we would say begins at conception, at the hands of another is murder, which is something we believe is wrong.
I hope this helps. If you have any more questions or would like to discuss things more, feel free to dm me. I know I'm not always the best at clearly articulating my view, so I would be glad to discuss it further."
2,Wow. And what is your basis for this punishment? Religion?
2,What is your basis for the punishment for murder? Or do you not believe murderers should be punished?
2,"It is encouraging to hear that my response was helpful. Thank you.
I agree that is important to listen to the opposing side. I find i often become arrogantly certain that I am absolutely correct when I either just think through it on my own or only listen to those that agree with me. But hearing the other side often adds perspective or brings up things that I didn't consider. This doesn't always change my position, but it helps me consider more aspects than I originally did which is important to having opinions about the world as a whole and how different things work together."
2,Murder of a human or murder of a fetus?
0,"I get that ""pro-life"" see life at conception, but why not also support adequate sex education and contraceptives instead of abstinence only to prevent unwanted pregnancies, and welfare to help these kids after they are born so the mother doesn't feel like she needs to abort because she has no future?"
2,Just murder. Or rape. Or any crime that should be punished. What is your basis for punishing crime in general?
1,"Thank you for your questions. As before I think those are important questions to ask especially since they can have a big impact on the lives of people involved. 
Would you expand on what sex education would look like? I think I would agree that sex education is important. I don't always agree with how it is put into practice (for example I live in a state that begins sex education in kindergarten. In my opinion that is far too early to begin discussing that topic). So if you clarify what you would desire in that regard, I could give you my opinion in that area. 
In regards to your point on abstinence verses other options, my personal belief is that sex is something reserved for marriage. In holding that view, I acknowledge that others do not hold that view. So I would hold abstinence as the ideal. That's what I believe people should do, but since they aren't going to, providing instruction in the other areas would be beneficial, but I would still emphasize the ideal. I don't believe contraceptives are wrong, I just don't think they are best before marriage. 
I think another reason abstinence is promoted over the other options is that no matter how effective the other options are, there is still a chance that it doesn't work, while with abstinence, it should be entirely effective because if you don't participate in the act that gets you pregnant, you can't get pregnant. Actions have consequences, if you do not want to be pregnant or to deal with a child, the most effective way to prevent that is to avoid participating in the activity that results in pregnancy. If you participate in that activity, you risk the result. 
I don't know that this specifically answers your questing, but one objection I personally would have to welfare being used as a solution is I don't believe it is the government's job to take care of children whose parents would struggle to provide for them. Instead I would say it is the responsibility of the people in that community to come alongside that mother and assist her in the provision and raising of that child. One of the ways this manifests is through charity like Pregnancy Resource Center and individuals seeing the need of that mother and child. 
If a person is truly holding to the pro-life view, they must continue to value the life of that child after they are born and so must be willing to do what it takes to protect that life. The child doesn't cease to be valuable as a human just because they have left the protection of their mother's womb. 
As before I hope I was helpful. If you have any questions or would like clarification, you are welcome to dm me. Thank you for your time."

1,Muslims r disgusting
0,"No, statistics can be manipulated

Edit: love that I am heavily downvoted for this statement by a bunch of republicans who consistently say that democrats are manipulating statistics to fit their viewpoint yet cant call out their own side when it happens.

Like, come on y’all! Be consistent Republicans instead of cheerleaders"
1,"Sad but true. Just like in the US our politicians live far from the areas where these groups mostly settle, and most of them don’t give a toss about what happens to the rest of us as long as the media and Facebook commenters keep smiling."
2,"Or they have a lower tolerance and file charges way often agains douchebags than other countries do. 

I’m a republican, but this is a stupid meaningless chart."
2,"BTW You can be pro-immigration but you can also have specific requirements and criteria for letting them stay in your country. For example I am a relatively progressive person , but I believe that in case that someone is a criminal (like killer ,rapist), bigot, doesn't believe in gender equality  etc then we shouldn't allow them to stay in a country or they should be deported. But if someone is a tolerant and nice person, I would be okay with them."
1,There is a reason why that statistic stops at 2014. Happens to be about that time the “centrist” party The Radical Left got in Office and made it illegal to collect ethnic data on violent and sexual offences.
2,white privilege
1,"Republicans are usually opposed to unchecked and illegal immigration, expecting some level of assimilation or cultural affinity before being allowed to enter the country.

Statistics like these vindicate those positions, since it is often native citizens suffering at the hands of these criminals, and by extension, their government's policy."
0,"Republicans need something to explain why they don't like brown people.

Crime stats from Denmark are what work today."
2,"To be fair towards the Iranians at least. We have gotten a fair number of petro-chemical engineers from Iran, some of which I have worked with and are decent folk."
2,That’s all well and good until there’s multiple assailants. Which there likely will be from the stories I’ve heard. These types of people usually roam in gangs. I’ll let your imagination do the rest.
2,"So, white males are the ones doing the rape? How do I read this chart /s"
2,I Think it shows the impact of Americas Foreign policy in the middle east over the last 20 years on crime stats in Europe.
2,"I think it's, for every 100,000 people who were born in Denmark, 0.7 persons have committed and was convicted of a rape. So for 200k 1.4 was convicted.

For those of Somali origin over 25 have been convicted. This doesn't even include Somalis who were born in Denmark because it's by country of origin"
2,"You're right, probably missing some context, or maybe is the definition of rape that differs"
2,"I wont down vote you yet, I will give you a chance to come up with proof of your claim. Please provide a link to validate that this claim that these stats are faked.  


Also, note that not all, but a lot of times when republicans disagree with stats its because there is a reason to besides they hurt my feelings. Like there are conflicting reports. Like a month or so ago when the CDC said Florida's daily covid death rates where through the roof, but come to find out the CDC had messed up the data and took a 3 day death total and displayed it as happening in 2 days. There were news articles proving this mistake, in that instance, yes republicans disagreed with stats because they were proven wrong.  


On that note I am giving you a chance to prove this wrong.  


But, while these links don't confirm these actual stats they do confirm the sentiment that the refugees from africa and the middle east are causing crime and rape problems in europe.

2,"You are right, in this statistic you need to take into account weather getting that statistic uses a general definition of rape or if it uses it's own countries law or definition of rape which it's actually surprising how laws differ extremely from country to country.

However even if their using the country of origins laws you would still have to wonder why Denmark has a low rape count? Do they have extremely strict laws or are they hiding their cases from us? Does Denmark stack up in comparison to other western countries(where the laws would be somewhat similar, obviously there would be some differences between them all) and would that show us something vastly different in comparison?

Also, if you were to look at the stat through a different lens like ""ohh well Denmark is just more civil"" or something of the sort then suddenly this has a vastly different meaning to what is presented as truth.

In other words, this statistic paints a pretty incomplete picture and it would help if it had something to drive the point home that wasn't itself."
2,"Or they just have less rapes in general. If you only have 2 rapes per 100,000 people, it would end up that you are arresting around 35% of them which is about twice as high as the rate of the US."
2,"Like ostriches sticking their head in the sand. Ignoring the problem doesn't make it go away. They're accomplices if you ask me, they know what will happen and its a price they are willing to pay. It's sick."
2,"Don’t have to imagine, I went to High School in one of the ghettos. 

We sadly don’t have the equivalent of your 2A, but I can help train my daughters to be more trouble than an opportunist is ready for and teach them enough values to recognize who to trust when out."
2,Well for 12 of the past 20 years the US had republican president's...
2,"True, there were no male witnesses and the woman were showing their faces.

not rape, culturally"
2,"I appreciate the opportunity, but I don’t really know, and I never purported to.  I am however, skeptical, and I always am when I see online tables because statistics can be manipulated!  And to this fact, there is no arguing.  There are entire libraries filled with books about how statistics can be misleading and purposefully deceitful.  

To reiterate and be clear, I simply disagreed with the prevailing sentiment and pointed out that statistics can be misleading. I have not done research into this specific instance, and I don’t care to.

As far as statistics being misleading, I am not going to link a bunch of articles you probably won’t read."
2,Less reported rapes* or else the families honor is shot
2,"Yup, in their culture it's not rape, shouldn't be in the same graph. 

Also, we should most likely start going by their laws in order to be inclusive."
1,"Ok, so to be clear, I gave you an opportunity to defend your statement that this table is false. And you essentially refuse to take it, saying you don't care to research the topic and based on your edit only spoke up in defiance of the information because you want to mirror republican behavior.

But like I said, and proved, above. When we disagree we often have evidence to back it up. We don't disagree because the information provided hurt our feelings.

Also you say stats can be and are manipulated. I 100% agree with you. I have an example.

The other day I saw a news clip that said, ""vaccinated people have a 99.999% survival rate. Unvaccinated people are 25 times more likely to die"" that sounds drastic! 99.999% survival rate vs 25 times more likely to die... Let's do that math.

100 - 99.999 = 0.001 (chance of death while vaccinated)

0.001 x 25 = 0.025 (25 times more likely to die while unvaccinated)

100 - 0.025 = 99.975% chance of survival for unvaccinated people.

Yet people are losing careers over vaccine mandates... For a vaccine that doesn't prevent you from contracting or transmitting. It doesn't even prevent you from dying. For an experimental technology (mRNA) that has never gone past lab trials before this year so there is ZERO long term effect studies.

See when republicans reject things, we typically have logic and facts to justify our stance."
2,"No we shouldn't why should we placate a bunch of murdering, terrorist, rapists?"
0,"I was responding to a comment about statistics being xenophobic. I simply stated that was false and foolish and that statistics can be misleading.



Denmark is the fifth most safe country in the world, and while mainstream news admits there are issues in respect to this area,



The reality is that reporting lags behind. I don’t know the reason for this, but since under reporting is rampant, it makes sense that criminal convictions would follow suit.  Instead of blaming a minority, this article describes a traumatizing process as the major issue.



This article expands on how antiquated the laws are, specifically calling for changes to acquaintance rape, the most common type of rape.  

The statistics are misleading because people are using it push a false narrative which blames refugees coming from a particular locality. It fails to account for the realities of the law and the people living there.  In short, statistics are misleading, and some people in this community are pushing their own narrative instead of actually doing the legwork."

1,Fauci was a driving force and had significant input into funding the Wuhan lab...that's why he was soo protective when the virus was released....he's sketchy as hell...why is the US funding a research lab in Wuhan?  China has plenty of money!...is it because Wuhan wouldn't have the oversight/ regulations/ scrutiny that a lab in the US or other free society country would have?
2,Why doesn't this apply to Gen Milley who stated that then President Trump was planning a coup?
2,"Under most circumstances I would agree, however I'm looking at this from a different view. The current administration has become a clear danger to America. There are circumstances under which a military officer is not only justified but also obligated to disobey a legal order
[refusing an order ](

With that said, It's not active duty military we should be depending on to call out the government. 
It's the American people aka private citizens that should be calling them out.
The current administration has become a clear danger to America and its citizens. 

Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) in the Declaration of Independence:

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation….

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.—That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness… it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.****"
2,When poor orders from superiors put life of marines in danger he is within his scope as a LT Col. to speak out. In the troops defense.  Semper fi   LT Col
2,"As a member of the American military, your duty is first and foremost the protection of the American people...even from their own government. He may have broken the rules, but the rules aren’t always right and he remains a hero nonetheless. May he one day walk through parades honoring him and be showered with accolades and medals for having the bravery and courage to do what so few individuals would ever even consider doing. Truly an American hero."
2,What about baby face vindman’s treason?
2,"He didn't even say anything directly aimed at Joe Biden. Listen to the original video. He says he wants ""...accountability from his superiors..."". Where is the contemptuous word in that statement? Shouldn't we ALL want accountability at every level of our armed forces?

I served four years 0311, for those of you who know what that means. Accountability was _huge_ at every level. Why is the Corps today _any_ different?"
1,Biden is a pos
2,Sounds like some North Korean military law or some shit
1,"Who is upvoting the original post? It's a troll post. He simply asked for accountability for the extremely fucked up withdrawal of Americans from Afganistan. Biden didn't even notify NATO of our withdrawal plans. 13 Dead marines. $84 billion of military equipment,  weapons, and vehicles given to terrorists. Taliban going door to door executing Americans and Afgans that helped us. Biden couldn't have fucked it up much worse if he tried."

2,Pretty sure he just shit on the generals. Not too mention he resigned his commission anyways.
2,Don’t military members swear an oath to the constitution? Would defending it against all enemies foreign or domestic not constitute commanders giving bad orders? Bad orders being ones that get say 13 military killed?

2,Because he didn't publically say anything. It was written by a reporter without his consent or confirmation. He further reinforced that military is apolitical when questioned on it.
2,Well then you should just get on with your treasonous goal to overthrow the government and quit pussyfooting about.
2,The proper way to speak out is via the chain of command.  I said when his statement went public that he was opening himself up to an Article 88 charge.

2,"Prior to the UCMJ creation in the 1950's, this particular rule was required by military officers even before America was officially a country.

2,Which is against the code he agreed to follow as a commissioned officer - he could of resigned his commission and then flapped his gums all damn day - he didn't until after he violated the Uniform Code - he even knows he's guilty - and getting damn close to sedition the more he talks
2,"Officers and soldiers are sometimes given bad orders.  They are expected to follow them, regardless.

The exception is orders that are illegal - soldiers are expected to disobey an illegal order - however, they will have to defend doing so in a court martial (though in wartime they might not make it that far).

The issue here is that this Lt. Colonel was not personally given an illegal order, so he had no grounds to disobey one.  At present, we don't know of any other instance where anyone involved was given an illegal order.  We know lots of **stupid** orders were given, but even so, not to this LTC.

What he did was violate the UCMJ, possibly in several particulars.  He will be lucky to not see prison as a result."
2,"So you want every swinging d*ck in the military debating what are good and bad orders and deciding which to obey and ignore?

13 deaths is going to look like nothing when that disfunction hits."
1,"Nope

He hasn't.
Silence implies consent. That us the legal standard.

He will be addressing the Foregin Relations committee, let's see how that goes."
2,"1st of all it would have to be a legitimately elected government before it could be called treason.
 Also I'm not talking about overthrowing anything. 
I simply pointed out legal references to why a military officer could do this, 
And to show how it is the people responsible to speak against this administration so that the military can legally remove them. Who said I'm pussy footing around. Not all of us are scared to speak out."
1,Yeh well sometimes you have to speak your peace.  Fuck political correctness when 13 are dead and biden is a fuck up !
1,"Quite clear you didn’t do military service. 

You complete a mental health exam EVERY year, so don’t buy into he had one because he criticized the president. He completed one because he was required to complete his annual. 

Joe Biden blatantly put marines in danger, despite an abundance of military intelligence without a single doubt telling him exactly what is going to happen months before the Taliban even took Kabul. 

He blatantly disregarded intelligence, armed the Taliban to the teeth so when we inevitably go in next it will be a slaughter, and made one of the worst military decisions possibly any president has made. 

We abandoned our allies, are openly being disrespected across the world, and made this world a lot more dangerous of a place because of his immaturity. 

Or are we going to talk about the blatant disrespect for every dead service member brought home according to a barrage of witnesses’ and gold star families?  

This president is effectively the sole reason for tens of thousands of deaths and ensured many more to come in the future. 

Calling out this administration for the blatant disregard for human life is only right, if he faces jail time so be it, he did the right thing.

The military may not be a “democracy”, but having completely arrogant and disastrous leadership that directly leads to the death of the men you swore to protect under your command, you morally have a right to say something."
2,"Yes, it’s unfortunate how poorly American heroes are compensated."
2,"Yeah I don’t understand, he’s not smart enough to just wait? Like they’re all corrupt we already knew that why throw ur whole career away there’s no honor in it"
1,Bullshit. He actively spied on Trump. Get rekt lib.
1,"No, Bidens approval rating is among the worst of any President in history, and it's because of Afganistan.  Gas prices are doubled. Inflation the highest its been in 40 years. Still millions of Americans out of work because our economy is shit. Democrats extended unemployment way too long and paid bonuses to people too lazy to look for a job. Many businesses closed because they couldn't find workers. 
 So you're full of crap if you think a majority support attacking an honest General that told the truth about Afganistan. Even the deep state leaked Bidens phone call with the Afganistan president asking him to lie about the Taliban having power."
2,The military isn't a democracy.
2,"The German Army has never been under the UCMJ, and the situations are not remotely similar."
2,Just seems people can give orders that result in deaths and get no punishment. Someone speaks against those people who directly caused others to get killed and they go to prison.
0,"He didn't respond because Uniform Code requires him not to speak on political matters which is what he said - I'm not defending him I'm answering a question as to why he is not in violation - when did the GOP become so touchy Feely - he broke the code,  - he's undisciplined - military discipline is crucial to the national defense - end"

That is the punishment for treason

Declare your independence and get to fighting. Otherwise 

If you don't love it, leave it

1,It's not political correctness. It military law to maintain order and discipline.
1,"...and when you violate the UCMJ to do so, there can be consequences (unless you are a leftist)."
2,You get to say all that because your not in the military - he doesn't cause he is - he could have resigned and said anything he wanted - he didn't so he violated military law - it ain't about your feelings - it's about maintaining discipline
2,"Yeah that's why I said none. 

Thought it made more sense to work here to build America than nation build in the Middle East.

Interesting timing on his annual ""Schelle acknowledged that he was the one who was forced to undergo a mental health screening after his initial video."""
2,He's was a Lt Col. and I'm not talking about Biden - I'm talking about military discipline - 93 upvotes
2,"No? Immoral or unethical behavior should always be questioned; since you mention UCMJ, I should tell you we are required to disobey unlawful orders and are supposed to question seemingly unethical actions are report them."
2,Yep.  That's how the military works.
2,He could have resigned his commission as an officer and flapped his gums all day with no worries or repercussions - he didn't and violated the law
2,"So you think the only reason this was added to the declaration of independence is because Jefferson was only justifying their actions? I think it was more so those that came after them would know what should be done and create a legal path todo so. I'm sure no lawyer but it seems to be more than justification but a warning to be prepared for future tyranny.

I definitely agree with the love it or leave it part tho. I think more than a few need to have their citizenship revoked and sent out of the country and some should be held accountable for their actions that have lead to our current situation."
1,"What happened to the military officers like Alexander Vindman who not only criticized Trump, he lied under oath for a phony impeachment? He filed a false whistle-blower complaint claiming he heard the Ukraine phone call. He didn't. An Obama holdover Eric Ciara-mella heard the call and used Alexander Vindman as a phony witness. No charges were  given to Vindman even after he was caught lying."
2,"I am in the military and nothing restricts my speech off of duty hours or out of uniform. 

For commissioned officers it is indeed different. My point is there’s a different between morals and laws. 

He was have been limited by law in technically, but morally he had an obligation to defend the honor and the lives of the service members serving under him. 

Countlessly the president and other high appointed officials, military and not do things that are blatantly against the UCMJ and against the law. Almost never do they face repercussions, and even very little do they receive scrutiny, that is as long as it sides with the left viewpoint that almost every corporation sector  and power house in this country supports."
2,The reality of Military service
1,"Correct.  What immoral or unethical order was Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller given, that he had a duty to disobey?

Contrary to leftist belief, *not liking* the President or senior officers does not grant military personnel carte blanche to disobey their lawful orders or act disrespectfully toward them."
2,So you can tell the difference between President and commanding officer?
1,"There is no legal path to overthrow the government.

There is a constitutional system to create laws, judge them and amend the constitution. You should know that as a ""constitutional conservative"".

You advocate something else it's called sedition or treason against our constitutional republic. They make tall trees and short prices of rope for them folks."
2,Then he should have resigned his commission and then complained - citizen presidents don't get court martials bc their not soldiers - who was the last president some country didn't want tried for war crimes - they don't get a fcking opinion - nor does a commissioned officer - period
2,The UCMJ and code of conduct clearly restricts speech of any enlisted or commissioned officer in the military.  You might need a crash course on military law.
2,"No, abandoning our people and actively arming a terrorists organization is plenty of ammunition to question what the hell is going on.  If you can’t even admit that point, I don’t see a reason in continuing this conversation."
2,"Yeah like the the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of a military department who are also covered and who I assume probably had something to do with the withdrawal - it's getting sad now"
2,Do you personally believe the current president and his administration have become a danger to America?
2,So your saying the declaration of independence is nothing but paper or our constitution?
2,"Go ahead and look up the hatch act and DOD Directive 1344.10. 

The UCMJ directly states commissioned officers."
1,"> No, abandoning our people and actively arming a terrorists organization is plenty of ammunition to question what the hell is going on.

It absolutely is.  However, those don't relate to orders Lt. Colonel Scheller was given.

His first video was a violation of Article 88 of the UCMJ.  His second video was a violation of that, and arguably Article 94 also, because it included the statement  ""Follow me, and we will bring the whole [expletive] system down"".  The possible penalties for violation of Article 88 are dismissal, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for one year.  Article 94 has the potential to carry a death penalty.

Biden and the senior officers under his command did a lot of bad things, and they should all spend time in prison.  ...but what Scheller did was dumb."
2,"The declaration of independence was a document explaining why British citizens were overthrowing their government and included specific examples of abuses by the king to justify why they were doing it to gather support from other British subjects living in the colonies and other European powers.

The Constitution was created to create a new constitutional republic to replace a failing confederacy of states. It includes a blue print for how this government should operate and how it can be changed through constitutional amendments. All states ratified this through a vote making it the new law of the land.

The bill of rights were added later through the amendment process established in the constitution because it was the law of the land. 

There is no, we declared independence so you can legally do it whenever you want clause.

Again, you want a revolution prepare to get bloody. And if that's you intention, quit pussy footing around, declare you rebellion and get to fighting"

1,It's good to see President Sippy Cup finally getting tough on border control. /s
1,"Biden and Democrats want to believe their lies that everything went okay that they are going to leave Americans to die there. If they helped then it would be acknowledging they messed everything up. 

Democrats strategy appears to be just parrot the propaganda for months and hope people believe your shi$t doesn't stink if you do it long enough."
1,It's possible that all of this was intentional. What if the Americans left behind were Biden's enemies. Biden hands the Taliban their name and addresses and let's the Taliban do his dirty work for him. His enemies are dead. Problem solved. He will take a hit in the polls early on in his administration in the hopes that by 2024 it's all forgotten.
2,"But he said efforts to get people out would be ""ongoing""."

1,so true. the USA should take note. ugh nvm we got Joe and the hoe running the circus.
0,"Sorry, but this data is completely made up.  Please check the government sites for Sweden and Israel for factual data.  Also, no country is currently on their 3rd shot of vaccine in other than critical care deployments.   This is just designed to rile people up and try to prove a point that isn’t supported by either measured fact or by critical reasoning.  Vaccines work.  Masks work.  Social distancing works.  The USA proved this was effective under both Trump and Biden.  Now we’re suffering again thanks to people spreading these lies.  Viruses mutate.  That’s why we get a different flu vaccine every year.  Covid mutated in the the more aggressive and dangerous Delta variant.  Now people with no defenses, folks who refuse to get vaccinated, are being hit hard.  This sucks and is completely avoidable.  How do I know this.  I’ve got two doctors in my family, both working ICUs.  Both watching people suffer and die.  Direct observation of fact.  Please get vaccinated and end this.

Edit:  As I noted in a follow up comment below, I was looking at the unvaccinated occurrence of infection, not the overall country rate.  But this also bought up the key difference in vaccination between Sweden and Israel.  Sweden is far more vaccinated than Israel is.  Hence lower  Hence relaxation of mask and social distancing.  Vaccinate and wear masks to help protect the unvaccinated."
2,The county we live in has nearly 100% vax participation and the R-eff has been 0.9 for almost two weeks. Mask mandates still in place...
1,I took a lot of heat on arguing that mask mandates don’t work. They’re quite a hive
0," boosters just started so that’s not relevant. 

Look at Sweden’s vaccination rate. Additionally because mask mandates don’t exist doesn’t mean people aren’t wearing masks and distancing because they are.  Nordics take community efforts seriously and usually don’t need to be mandated to do the right thing."
2,"This is really true data, and it’s not a bad two groups to pit against each other, they are both relatively small countries that are mostly homogenous racially, and the only true difference is claimed it (and I do wonder if that has anything to do with it, the Middle East is… Well, desert, and isn’t Sweden fairly cold?)"
1,Mask killed my mom it has no use they just recommend it to us so we vote dems
2,"I’m not antivaxx, but don’t give over 330 million people a vaccine until your positive it works. That’s just common sense"
2,you realize the population is only bigger by 1 million in swedes yet it’s 21x bigger?
1,I'm happy to be in the control group until human trials are over.
2,not to mention sweden is 21x bigger then israel with a slightly similar population
2,"Seems legit to me.  
[Sweden](

[Israel](  

From swedish government:  
  

  

55 in ICU in entire Sweden atm."
2,"Swede here. I live in Stockholm. Hopefully my tourism in this sub will be tolerated. 
 
Practically no one wears mask, if someone does it is almost always old people and they usually wear the good tightly fitted ones. Slightly more people wear on public transport, some put them on just when they travel. Walking in central stockholm, maybe 1 in 100 you see wear mask. Cashiers and working people are some times required to wear one. Mostly people stopped caring.  

[Here is Stockholm, July '21, 600 people [sound]]("
2,"Sweden is also over 10x larger with a significantly higher income population and a similar population size, most of their mandates that restricted public crowding and enforced social distancing were lifted in mid-July. In terms of vaccination, Sweden is at about 60%, and while climate can affect viral transmission, it is likely in large part to Sweden's much lower population density that we see these numbers"
1,Weren't Sturgis and the Trump rallies the superspreader events that didn't happen?
2,"The alternative to facts and knowledge isn’t OK when it comes to a subject, a very communicable disease in this case, that affects people in a community.  If it only affected an individual then do as you like regardless of observable fact and measurement."
0,"You are correct.  I was looking at unvaccinated case rates, not country wide case rates.  That was my mistake and I apologize for the error.  The statistic that’s missing here is the country wide vaccination rate.  Sweden is far ahead of Israel on that which is what’s driving their low case rate

Message stays the same.  Wear a mask.  Get Vaccinated.  If you’re sick, stay away from others.  This is basic healthcare stuff that we’ve known about for several centuries."
1,"They were supposed to be, but it turns out the bigger the crowd of people that don't give a shit, the less reported cases there are. Anyone that got sick probably hung out at home and thought to themselves, "" well shit I'm sick "" then a few days later felt better just like 99% of everyone else that gets this.   They didn't go on national TV and talk about their positive test and how everyone should get vaccinated, so the news is not interested."

0,"What I don't understand and never will is this; if I am dying or at deaths door, what doesn't it matter if I wish or chose to take drug that is considered controversial that could possibly save me? Not just cause of covid, I felt this way before covid."
2,"We don't need more physicians, we fewer liars..."
2,">(of 12) 9 of these patients are now home, and the 10th is rapidly improving

isn't that what happens usually, anyway?

sounds like a job for a medical scientist with a background in statistics, to me"
2,"Doctors have a duty to do no harm, if you wanted lots of pain killers that could stop your breathing and kill you, there’s a limit to what they will give since they can’t practice what would be literal suicide at that point. Also there are laws. In the case of a doctor won’t intubate or use resuscitative measures if you have that signed along with other treatment modalities you can chose to refuse. Plus depending on the drug many have drug-drug interactions that could either enhance or decrease the current efficacy of medications you’re on based on its metabolism. Lastly it’s for prevention of law suits. Let’s say you ask for a bunch of random medication and survive yet have side effects that cause permanent damage or require surgery or other things, now you’ll be suing the hospital. 

Lastly in the case of this tweets correlation doesn’t equal causation. Ivermectin is used to treat parasites. People are buying animal formulations and overdosing themselves, and the media is having a field day calling it medicine. Just like I’ve seen people struggling financially use animal antibiotics and getting deathly sick or using insulin doses for pets. Covid is a virus. Viruses aren’t alive. Just like antibiotics which work on bacteria wouldn’t help in this case, neither would anti fungal medication. 

I also don’t understand why the people who adamantly argue that this virus is a hoax or man made or not that serious and won’t get vaccinated or wear a mask suddenly feel so scared of it that they have to take ivermectin.  

Next thing you know, covid patients are gonna be asking for chemo and radiation to kill everything in their body."
2,"Yes, the hypocrite oath. Yes, assisted suicide is for the most part illegal in the US. I am familiar with DNRs, I used to be a paramedic and worked in a trauma center. Also I am familiar with contraindications when I comes to medication, I was a line Medic in the Army. However, if I was in sound mind and sighed a liability waver or give power of attorney to a family member, thus relasing the attending physician of any and all legal liability prior to my contraction of ANY virus or illness, why not?  The virus is not a hoax but, my job allows me to view certain government materials. The last brief I read was that COVID spread was ""very unlikely"" to be spread naturally. ""More than likely"" leak out the lab, however not meant to be a bio agent. 

I do not believe any virus is a hoax, we have pictures of them. That was not my argument."
2,I mean I support the whole your body your choice thing. I’m only a 4th year medical student so I can’t speak from too much experience yet. I think if the person is willing to pay and like you said of sound mind and judgement and doesn’t hold anyone liable then by all means. But they shouldn’t then go and claim whatever worked for them as a miracle cure without further testing since there are many factors that go into play. And a sample size of 1 is meaningless.
2,"Much respect for being a med sudent!! We need more doctors in this country. You are a 4th year med student you can absolutely speak. Do not think you can not. I don't advocate for for treatments that work worked for me will work for others. I am a big dude. So my doses are usually higher. However, if look at dose to weight ratios you can see why people do things, without the understanding of rNA insulin vs. Synthetic."
2,Yea exactly and thanks I appreciate it. Always nice to have a civil discussion. I’m not a rebuplican or democrat and my views vary depending on the topic but I think we lack the critical thinking and decent these days

If that person leaves office, Larry Elder can appoint a Senator. If that happens, Republicans gain the majority in the Senate. So Democrats are doing everything they can to avoid that situation."

2,You think this is bad... Candace Owens speaking on slavery in a recent Prager U video was even worse.
1,Tyt might be the most racist so called news ever. The Democrats are the founders and promoters of the kkk do they not know history?
2,"So this is what I worry about… I’ve followed TYT for years, but recently they made a very convenient edit to videos from Jimmy Dore, regarding alleged sexual harassment towards Ana Kasparian. As I stated before, I’m not a fan of jimmy Dore at all, but his comments were about Kasparian being unprofessional with her work attire, and framing it as a joke. What he said was, “that’s a nice “news” skirt”—  They played a clip of Dore saying, (this is not verbatim) “i made her feel terrible, and ashamed… I did that” — then the clip stops and Cenk calls him a “monster”. Right after the clip cuts off, Dore finishes his comment by explaining how terrible it was that he made her feel that way, and then he apologized. 
—— with that said, I’m voting for Newsom, don’t like Elder, but I’m very curious about what he said after the clip stopped, because it was very abrupt. Elder doesn’t seem like he is advocating for paying slave owners reparations. The point he seems to be making is that it was legal to have slaves, so if reparations were paid out, an argument could be made for the slave owners receiving reparations as well. He didn’t sound like he was advocating for that, but just making a point on reparations as a whole. If I were to make a guess, he was making an argument against reparations, not making a point that slave owners should be paid as well."
0,A new low for Elder. Saying this to attract white votes is his style.  And there is Owens his female twin. Cali elect him and lookout. Whites want him to do the dirty work. Which he will gladly do. This all started with his hatred of his father. His own father.

1,"Yes, Reparations. Taking money from people who never owned slaves and giving it to people who never were slaves. 
What about white americans from the north whose ancestor probably died fighting to free the slaves? Or black people today whose ancestor's owned slaves? Or what about mixed racial people - would a black person with a white slave owner ancestor have to pay? What about a white person with a black slave ancestor, would they receive money? 
The rabbit hole of reparations makes no sense and is widely open for abuse and perpetuating resentment that should have died decades ago. That's Elders point. You're either too stupid to understand that or are deliberately misrepresenting him so you can smear him."

1,You leftists are completely racist and he never said that slave owners should get reparations. Larry elder was attacked in a gorilla mask by leftist and people like you support it. You never cared about black lives and hate black people who think for ourselves Leftists are the biggest racist.
0,"People like Larry Elder make me sick. Does he really believe that if he were living in the south during the slave days, he wouldn't have been captured and sold just every other black man was."
1,"The young turks are missing Mr. elders point all together. Intentionally. Mr. Elder is pointing out the absurdities one encounters when going down the rabbit hole of reparations.

Elder opened my eyes on the matter. Made me contemplate some important questions and consider things I had not considered. 

Would Rachel dolezal get reparations? Would Oprah Winfrey? Obama? Kamala Harris? When today there are FAR more poverty stricken white people in America than any other people. Do all black people get reparations even though many NEVER had relatives who were enslaved? What about those black people whose families were actually slave OWNERS? There were many. Who pays these reparations? All white people? All citizens whether they had anything to do with the slave trade or not? Republican families who sacrificed their own flesh and blood to liberate the slaves and end the infamous traffic? People whose families never even lived in the country until maybe 100 years after the infamous traffic of slavery had ended? They owe, too? The South was home to 250,000 free blacks. Do their descendants get reparations, too? There were ~4000 black slave owners owning more than 20,000 slaves. How does that figure into “Reparations”? Since the country’s founding 306,000 slaves were brought here, but since slavery ended more than 2,000,000 black Africans have come here by choice... another 1,000,000 Black Americans came here by choice and by way of the Caribbean. how does THAT figure into reparations?

Because of Larry elder it now seems to me that the only proper way to handle the inequities of the past is to make sure that our laws are just TODAY. That they’re applied equally to every citizen. To continue to provide access to opportunity WITHOUT favoring or handicapping ANY racial group. I think that’s the best we’ve got."
2,People please Don’t vote for a man who clearly is twisted in the head 🤪
0,larry elder is just playing to the GOP base. white racists love to pretend they are the victims.
0,"Black Republicans and conservatives shouldn't have any power at all anywhere, or even have any freedoms here in America because there white supremacist."
2,legality vs ethics. just because something is legal doesnt necessarily make it right. just because something is illegal doesnt necessarily make it wrong.

2,He sounds dumb after you lose a war when are you paid anything doesn’t the loser usually pay? You pay for the other side not to come back and kick your ass again…
2,"So if people were property and it was legal how were they included in the constitution as ""WE THE PEOPLE"" when were not included.🤔🤔🤔"
2,Dumb sh1t people say. BUT The definition or reparation is simply righting a wrong thats whatvwe need to understand first and realize most people are referring to money and don't know wtf they are talking about.
2,TYT you're dome for speaking on a country that's been around  for thousands of years with their own way of life  their own culture America has  been around how long? the arrogance sometimes I think you people just like to hear yourself talk cuz you're not solving shit  just running your mouth!!
1,"A conversation about the optics of this,  I think is wrong. The Taliban maybe bad but there is nothing in this clip which is I haven't seen on or advocated on US TV. It's their right to bear arms, they weren't pointing their guns at the anchor so I don't see the problem. If like me they have been watching US TV over the last few years they would believe it'll be foolish not to have a gun on them at any point"
2,"What were they thinking? They did not. That is their usual aesthetics for when someone holds a camera and so they used it. Probably will change where the less brain dead have a say but that is probably just it. No messaging intented - nothing intented, just mindless. Not that being controlled by mindless people with absolute power was any good. Just saying that it is probably not contious messaging."

2,Well…. These completely UnEducated caveman idiots have takin control. WoW!   Really???  This could have been avoided had the powers just continuously dropped bombs on the mountains or “known” underground housing and tunnel systems. Instead catering to them and pretending that this wasnt going to happen. It was ALLLLL planned!   If you think any differently youre a fool.    Look at how easy its been and how we are playing nice while those animals are killing innocent people. The Taliban are the scum of the earth  ( . )     The only way its ends is to kill them all  &   You all know it. Animals go extinct all the time. What’s different now?
2,"Religion will poison your mind, but if one religion will poison your mind worse than all others, it is Islam."
0,"It doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter if the Taliban is awful. Saudi Arabia is beyond awful, and you guys just gave them billions of dollars in weapons. Trump bragged about it being the biggest weapons deal in history. United States supports right-wing fascist dictators all over the planet right now as of this moment. No country on Earth has more blood on its hands than the United States."
2,I agree with Cenk 💯%
2,Death to the Taliban
2,"The US didn't ""create"" the Taliban, the US and other nations funnelled money into Afghanistan to help the Mujahideen fight the Soviets, it's arrogant to say the US ""created"" the Taliban, tell it as it happened."
2,"He is actually saying that the President and other government officials have fled the country and now the country is back in the hands of Taliban. I did not hear him say ""don't worry"""
2,"This is what happens when you put literally Neanderthals weapons and power. Seriously though, take a screenshot of the cavemen in the back and take a screenshot of an actual rendering of a Neanderthal and put them together. Tell me these aren't literal cavemen!"
1,These so-called journalists in America should look at this and see what they are actually doing while these American journalist sit here and almost defend these people it's sickening to see what the news media and turned into they are the press for the Democrat Party there is no longer any biased news outlets
2,"Nice to see presenters actively disagree with each other on the video in a spontanious way. Immediately the honesty of the presenters shine through. With TYT, at least you can tell while they have an Ideological view that informs their reporting style. They're not actively trying to BS their audience."
2,Islam is the religion of peace.
2,"We allow women to go to school/ university but only with female proffesors.
Do you have any female professors?
No, because women were not allowed to go to school  previously."
1,This is great! Young Turks TV should have gunmen behind them as well. Their lying will stop. 😎
2,"Reminds me of the Mexican cartel videos, except the cartel hit men wear face coverings."
2,"The US should stop f***ing around, the US acts like that all the countries in the world are some whores and it can f**k any one whenever it want. What the US did to Vietnam, Cambodia, Iraq, Syria, Libya etc , what it got from it??? 😁 Running pants-less!!!! And now from Afghanistan.
 You should all be ashamed of yourselves. You aren't police of the world you are just another f***ing country that should mind its own business. It took you more than 200 years to get rights to your black people. Keep calm and let the natural process of change in other countries too.    You f***ing morons"
0,I've never heard anyone from NBC or CBS or even ABC say a word about loving war. Nor have I heard that on any other news channel. I don't what CONservative media so I don't know what they say about war. I think someone needs a vacation to unplug from the craziness for a while.
2,News Flash their terrorists and we armed them to the teeth!
2,Jenk is getting to the heart of the matter between positive punishment and negative punishment. The gun wielding psychos will positively put a bullet in your head if you don't do what they say the checkbook wielding psychos will negatively affect your bank account leaving you destitute and wishing that there was a bullet in your head.

0,This is what is going to happen in the USA.  if we let Trump supporters take over the government.  Just take a look at their policies and it matches the taliban.

0,"Oh Ana, you open with a question that presupposes that religious zealots think rationally. Haven't you seen enough of the Christian Taliban here in the US to know better?"
2,"That’s pretty scary. 
What our news would have looked like if Rump had won."
2,"CENK! I admire you but the way you silenced Ana here was prettier horrendous. This was after all a section introduced and presented by her about the Taliban literally holding new media hostage in Afghanistan. You decided to steal the segment by turning it into an attack on your American media rivals. When Ana tried to respond to this you cut her off repeatedly and then said ""hold on"" which suggests you will allow her to respond at the end. But once you made your point you ended the section without allowing her any retort. 
The Taliban taking total control of the media is an important story but you dismissed it and silenced Ana voice by wagging your finger at her and then holding your hand up to silence her in a very dictatorial fashion. 
This came off terribly. I'm not saying this as some sort of fan of Ana, I actually think she too often doesn't do her due diligence before reporting on a story and it clearly shows but as a boss I would never raise my voice to literally drown out the voice of a female staff member while wagging my finger at her and then use the ""stop!"" hand gesture to silence them. You are meant to be a progressive.
I hope you read this as that was very dictatorial behaviour and is a nasty window into your workplace behaviour."
0,Saudi Arabia created the Taliban. And Bush helped them. And Trump owes MBS millions.
2,One should not be afraid of zealots intent on killing you?

2,jokes on you guys. there were no bullets in those guns.
2,"STOP! The US did not help the Taliban while fighting the Soviets, they helped the Mujahideen, who in turn got defeated by the Taliban. 

Also, I am sure that this reporter would prefer being held ""hostage"" by receiving millions of $ from the Taliban and being threatened with no further donations."

2,"A gun for a taliban fighter is like their arm or leg. After all this time fighting, it’s just a part of them. I don’t even think they considered how it would come across, because it’s just there with them, throughout it all, whether with intention or not."

2,Corrupt reporting of news is an even bigger problem.
2,This one police chief can't speak for all.  He's just as ignorant as ol' Walter.
2,those police mans must in federal court to sentence to death. think at those man who sentenced arnold schwarzenegger to death in california for killing womans. this persons - killers was policemans.  this is real life. law is law. if not sentence those mans to death this is crime against humanity with policians whos are in this affaire likewise in. what get a man if with this police chief after bankrobbing this do? from police mans? or from court? especially if this chief is inocent?

1,"If this Police Chief cannot maintain control in his area, he needs to find another job. All his ass is doing is getting his 5 minutes of fame for badmouthing the President! Oh, from Houston...another Liberal city!"
2,"Unfortunately, this ...umm... ""police chief"" didn't understand that the Trump quote was directed at the govdrnors on the phone call.  Not at anybody else, and not at the police.  

But hey, you don't have to be a genius to be a  ""police chief"" when the staunchest ally of police that ever occupied the Whitehouse was the guy you are bad mouthing."
2,How nasty and dare that police chief is to disrespect president of united States?
2,if this guy run i will vote for him
2,"This turd box; coming from a Chief who had his department saluting a criminal as his casket went by and draped with an American Flag, as if this guy was in the military or Law Enforcement. Shame on him… total disgrace!"
2,"Most of these big city “chiefs” are political hacks, shuffled around from city to city as a de facto Federalization of local police forces. I’m glad to live where the chiefs are still pulled from the ranks."
0,"To the police chief... YOU'RE A MORON!!!!....You playcate the leftist radical, lawless agenda...From a family of veterans, including a fallen Navy Seal, your a ball less sheriff....And you most certainly don't speak for the majority of law enforcement...We all believe in love, but sometimes, especially now, love has to be tough...When the thugs in the streets are pillaging and accosting citizens, it ain't a hug that's gonna stop em....it's law enforcement that aren't afraid to do their job......"
1,Get all the trump supporters immediately it is serious we need to go to war
1,"Well to the police chief on behalf of me as one of the people if you would do less interviews on the news and more of your job maybe BLM wouldn't be ravaging the streets burning down communities! 
Ps 
I wonder where the police Chiefs and the police officers were when BLM storm the gates of suburban neighborhoods!

2,if this guy run i will vote for him
2,Police Chief Art Acevedo is the best leader and I am a big fan.
2,"Great police chief,  he 100% right."
2,A wise man. We all need 2 come together... We have become a divided nation!!!😢
2,"This man is one of the reasons I respect people who serve our country with honor and respect. I’m not just talking about people who wear the uniforms either😒. Chief Acevedo made a good point where our problems lie. If you want things to change in your favor then you need to vote for it. Also, I know that this is old news but I really don’t understand why people always think violence is the answer. Look what this worldwide riot sparked from. Police brutality. I happen to respect the police department but when there is an officer who uses unnecessary force or worse goes against all protocol and what has been taught, then I lose that respect. Trump’s answer during this crazy situation was to “dominate”. I was disappointed not just because of how he spoke to the governors but also that he decided to use force as a first solution. should never be a first solution, no matter the circumstances. Here’s why. First depending on who you’re picking a fight with and how many, they might beat you senseless. Second all you are doing is making yourself look like the bad guy which is okay if you’re trying to conquer someplace but not such a good a idea to do with your own nation. Finally we have a thing called diplomacy. Ever heard it? Been around since the Roman Imperial Era? It doesn’t just apply with political agendas, if you know the country then it applies just as well to the public. Talking things out isn’t a guarantee, especially in the “free country”, but in emergency situations it’s a better first option than sending the National Guard. Violence is always met with more violence."
2,What should people do when we are physically threatened by those who are not peaceful towards us?
2,"So proud of you Mr. Acevedo...1 because you were chief here in Austin, TX, where I reside, 2 because you are now chief in Houston, where I was born & raised, 3 because you are an Orgullo Latino, 4 because you are a big hearted human being & I can just go on & on...anyways. God bless u always, Mr. Acevedo 🙏🏽"
0,Trump always likes to act like he's the best friend the police could ever ask for. It's very relieving to hear to this man to set him straight.
2,No cop they stepped into the danger willingly when they got hired leadership hmm stop whining an lead then
2,"What an ego maniac !!  Art Acevedo is NOT the designated spokesperson for ALL Police Chiefs in the USA !   He's a loudmouthed, Oatbreaking JOKE"

Since it is very important,  so every State Capital and national guard can stop the mad attacks from Trumpiests who are armed and dangerous. I pray Joe Biden and Kamila Harris take over White House in peace. But before that all who are protectors of state capitol and our democracy should remove these dangerous organizations asap. 
Please watch this:

It's a part of our national history that we brought slaves to America to work in the fields picking cotton. So we can't change what Americans were taught in school. History is history, like it or not. In my entire life I have never judged a man or woman by the color of their skin. I wasn't brought up that way. But we have to teach our children that it is wrong. People need all the information available to make their decisions on how the country is run. If you start banning books then the public is not getting all the available information and they are unable to make proper decisions."

How else could book burners have so much resources. Google CRT and the first 3 page results are dominated by anti CRT articles. How could they enter candidates for every political and civic office in the country, from small districts to the presidency, sheriff, District Attorney, SCHOOL BOARDS. Parents who like there history honest just set some time aside to learn together with your kids, I recommend the story of Jim Thorpe or the 1936 Berlin with the articles or documentaries that include Jesse Owens African American team mates that won medals of their own and their experience back home."

What a bunch of lying hypocrites they are. They are doing what  trump accused China of doing to the Uighurs, creating re-education camps and forcing it on the blacks! 

Women in China's ""re-education"" camps for Uighurs have been systematically raped, sexually abused, and tortured. The republicans working in every area in this dysfunctional legal system have been doing the latter for many, many years!

The Hispanics are afraid to say boo and draw attention to themselves, or they'll be the next to go.

0,"Dear: Republican Party

  When it came time to protect America you refused when the Alt-Right and the Neo-Nazis came you kept the door open for them. 

When Trump back these hate groups you protected him, a P.R. statement saying you refuse to support racism, then back Trump's hatemongering declarations the very next day. 

Who are you people to accept racism as a political platform? When David Duke supports Trump you did nothing, just give me my Tax Cuts and my Judges Mr. Trump.  

African Americans are being attacked on the streets by Americans for, cooking, sleeping, shopping by Trump Supporters you could care less. 

When Trump broke the law dealing with Russia you protected him again. 

  Meanwhile, the hate groups are getting stronger, Anti-Governments Groups increase, but you Republicans do nothing. 

I say this as an independent voter you have permitted Donald Trump to become an American Dictator to keep your power. 

He Attacked Black Lives Matter for his supremacist racist base, for a Photo Op. 
The Republicans did nothing, Terrorist attacked Michigan's Capital you did nothing to stop Trump. 
Trump told the Proud Boys, I'm with you 
The Republicans did nothing. 
The Capital Has Been Attacked and you have settled back and have allowed Donald Trump and his followers to commit treason.  

I say this to you honestly all of you are cowards to the Ameican People. It might not feel that way with the backing of Right-Wing Media, The Power and Money you have gained. 

We all saw it though, time after time watching you allowing Trump to do anything he wanted. 

A police officer has died and yes every one of you Republicans is to blame for his death, Fox News can't help you spin out of this. 

There is no honor, no integrity, or compassion within your party. 

Why do you ignore white supremacy and their organizations? 

Time won't heal this one, you have shown us who you are and we will never forget. 

Never Forget.

1,I'm tired of it all put these fools in jail
2,China is asshoe
2,"maybe on the other side, china reports sleepy joe is the worse president in this term"
1,Biden doing the same thing
1,"Newsmax TV, the most war mongering propagandist news source available."
2,"I've been an American citizen for 26 years. During this time I've been following Russian and American news. I understand two perspectives. Americans aren't being told the truth neither about Russia nor China. In fact, with respect to both, Americans are constantly told lies, especially about China. When Trump was saying let's make friends with Russia, I began to think that Trump really wants to free America from the control of the Deep State because making any deals with Russia is what the Deep State doesn't want, be they Neocons or Democrats. Trump acted like Democrats were preventing him from making friends with or even talking to Putin or having a negotiation, meanwhile he imposed sanctions after sanctions against Russia. Then, at the end of Trump's term, he truly waged a massive anti-China information campaign, similar to the one Reagan waged against the USSR. What this tells me is that Trump wanted to fool everyone that he is a nice guy who wants to make friends with Russia and others. This tells me that he is still down with the people who are interested in regime changes in Russia and China and are not interested in negotiations, which means that Trump isn't any better than Bush, Obama, Clinton, etc. He almost fooled me. I thought that Trump was against the DS, but he was with the Neocons. If he wasn't with the Neocons, then he was surrounded by them, which means that he just couldn't really do anything from the get go and he wasn't in control of anything. They only allowed him to do certain things and said no to everything else. It is a 2-party 1-party system and the president is just a puppet, whether it is Trump, Biden, Obama, or Santa Claus."
0,First we must remove China Joe from office or we will be done with free America
2,I'd take Pompeo for President.
1,"President Trump called him to release the email, and he didn’t. Now he stated to talk about them."
1,"Hillary Clinton to Trump: ""I cant wait to see you in prison.""  Trump Answers: "" I don't think they will allow you visitors."""
2,If Trump runs and wins in 2024 he needs to go scorched earth on every Dem and corrupt Rep in office.  We all understand you have limitations on your first term and that the second term is the time you get to pull all the punches.  Which is why the Dems were shitting their pants and which is why they used the Media to hide their illegal activities and corruption.
2,Hilary Clinton's emails are not on state.gov i was just on the website and see nothing even close.

1,Guess that 30 year pension helps you turn in the badge  lol
1,Let the corruption system collapse and let's rebuild
2,"Part of my faith in man has been restored. Resist resist resist never stop resisting. What they could do to us is not nearly as bad as what they're attempting to do. Say it proud, say it loud, never stop saying it!."
2,Respect! Thanks for standing up and be counted! I’m in the same boat with my tech job. I’ll be let go next week for my refusal to get vaccinated.
2,That cop is a freaking hero. It takes a brave man to risk everything to stand up for the very principles this country was founded on.
1,"They are forcing good, strong, humble people like this man to choose between standing and kneeling. They’re goal is to make us stand, so we can be eradicated. They want only the sheep to be left. I say we give them what they want."
2,Thank You for your service and for your bravery in facing this outrageous mandate. Biden is out of control. They are not mandating the people at the borders . a bunch of hypocrites
2,They are just sorting whose loyal to the party or not.
1,"Resigning doesn’t help hurt them, though. Make them fire you and then sue their butts!"
2,All hail our new fascist government.

1,"So they're not really ""Blue Lives"" if you can decide to just quit one day."

1,"Even if ur not religious, u hafta respect this man’s strength of character and principles. He’s made quite a large sacrifice, n my estimation, to stand up for what he believes n. And that n and of itself is worthy of respect."
1,"This is how they remove people that MAY be conservative or republican from their jobs because let’s face it it’s the opinion of the leftists and dems that only trump supporters and republicans are against this vaccine which really isn’t true, people across the board are against the vaccine mandate not necessarily the vaccine. I’m a part time Uber and Lyft driver and today while working I met a woman who lost some of her sight and became partially paralyzed a couple days after taking the second dose of the vaccine and her doctor admitted it was almost certainly from the vaccine but these doctors aren’t reporting these cases so there really is legitimacy to peoples concerns about this vaccine and the government and businesses shouldn’t be putting mandates in place that essentially force people to get vaccinated or lose their jobs."
2,We live in a communist country
1,"what if they say no more pension without ""vaccination""?"

0,"Great, let's just wreck our military now.  The cops wrecked themselves a long time ago by being tyrants."
1,"They are pushing the best out of the military and police department.  
Biden should be arrested for treason , I 100% believe he and CONGRESS LEFT AND RIGHT are willfully causing this country to collaps.  

Our best pilots are quiting , Navy seals and other people who are red blooded Americans ....

This nation is in danger ."
2,When you lose your best and brightest only bad stuff can happen. And this is just what the left wants well I guess there really is going to have to be community policing neighbors protecting neighbors from Biden supporters
1,This man is my hero! I too will not get the vax! I support him 100%!
1,"As much as I applaud these polices officers and military personnel, and support them fully, it scares me that more and more are quitting. Soon we will have nothing but leftist snowflakes left in law enforcement and our military."
1,Understood and I applaud him but he served 30 years and is more than able to walk away with his pension. A lot of younger police officers can’t do this and it sucks.
1,Our jobs are like our family are people at our jobs we love the people at our jobs we love their families we love their children we interact with people children we don't want to see people suffer for something that's that's could have been handled earlier everybody blaming everybody this is not Trump for we love Trump do not blame this on Trump I'm not having it no one I mean no one will blame this mess up Joe did on Trump we love Trump we love Trump

2,"This mandate won’t last long. When city employees start leaving and no one fills that void, things will only get worse. When restaurants start to close, this’ll go away. Good on this man and all of the others that stood up for what’s is right."
2,"Find out what Luc Montagnier, the man that discovered the HIV virus, says about this vaccine! He is one of the most brilliant minds we have and they won’t publish what he says because they don’t want us to know the truth!!!"
2,"Everyone is missing the entire point.
The tyrants want all the free thinking, freedom minded cops and military to quit.
That way when the tyrants turn the police and military against citizens; they will have only ones that will follow orders."
2,This is what I think when I see this video. Look at how these vaccine mandates are weakening our military and police force. Doesn’t it make you wonder maybe it’s being done on purpose?
2,GOD BLESS THIS MAN!!! HE WILL PREVAIL!!!! THIS IS LUNACY!!!!

I need my job, so i went ahead and got the vaccine.  Im so upset and heated over this illegal action. Our deadline is here at Montefiore Medical Center. Our union 1199 did nothing! They didn't fight hard for us as a matter of fact, it was very weak. Bless this guys heart. ❤🙏"
2,"Every council member, every mayor, every petty tyrant abusing the 13th amendment by taking a proprietary interest in our bodies should be given a fair trial and a fine hanging."

1,How do you teach American history without telling the truth
1,"Democrats the party of racism, Covid, crime and treason."

1,Keep racism and marxism out of schools. Critical Race Theory IS racism. It separates white from every other color. End of argument.
2,"Trickle-down ecomonic policy fails a shift in market (computer automation).
Automation dominates production and unstoppable.
Jobs are considered waste with automation, targets for removal.
Market doesn't create jobs like before, why taxes should be raised to pay for new jobs and infrustructure.
Trickle-down ignores that critical effect of computer automation, fuels inflation to give a boost to job loss from automation.
No compelling reason for citizens to pay for automation job-recovery with inflation when it's good times for market(automation).
Automation is good thing, saves time and gains more value than gold.

We allow politicians to invest in automation, they gain more despite job loss so it goes ignored.
Adding the 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution would fix it, end corruptton and trickle-down policy.
Wolf-Pac helps."

2,The activists need to be removed from the education system in the entire country. That’s exactly why we have so many problems right now!
2,What's with these Americans? Seems like Bojo and Nancy is infecting them😳
1,"Want to solve the problem? Pull your kids out of school. They get no funding for your child, therefore less money, and you will have more intelligent children, in the end. Home school is more education that any public school ever wanted to be."
