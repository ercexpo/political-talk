0.0,"r  Republican views are supposed to be the same as Libertarians,  but Republicans have been passing a lot of Socialist and Communist laws, like the Patriot Act after 911 and Universal Healthcare-Libertarians were outraged. They believe these laws are government overreach.  The party is small, but has been growing as a result of Trump's handling of the Coronavirus.

1.0," Term Trump TV Network If he won clean, that's fine. I don't understand how people like you don't seem concerned about all the irregularities out there, but I guess integrity doesn't matter much to people like you. Which is ironic considering all I've heard for years is how Trump lacks integrity also from the same people like you. You're all just delusional hypocrites at the end of the day, aren't you?"
1.0,"Bill, you're a journalist. The Charlottesville thing bothers you to this day? So go look up what Trump actually said. He was talking about the confederate flag and statues debate, he said there were fine people on both sides, nothing to do with the far left and klan that showed up later.

1.0,"This is explosive!
My thoughts at this point are: the Democrats must have known that the response from Trump would have been a lawsuit and investigation like this, given that their (democrats) fraud efforts were so blatant.  They must have realised that all of this would become public knowledge at some point - so how do they expect to counter this? What's their next move here?"
1.0," Ael what you missed is he was talking about Trump going to court, and the dems not wanting to allow it. This whole part is of the democrats not following protocol and actually misusing their power. Are you daft?"
1.0," Sama Hi, do you have any articles or sources of illegally lowering identification for mail in ballots?
From my understanding, they probably won’t send you a mail in ballot unless you are already registered. Also, if a change is through a law, is it illegal? I’m pretty sure states have some authority over their voting laws, depending on what it is."

1.0,"I'm glad there's postal workers that are coming forward and refusing to be a part of the fraud. I just wish they'd show their face. I would be pissed off if my bosses asked me to do something illegal too. Not only is it morally wrong and it's betraying your country, but if this gets investigated,  their supervisors and the postmaster will NOT be there to back them up. The frontline employees backdating these postmarks are the ones who will go down."

1.0,"i always tell religious people to calm down with religious arguments and citations from the Bible (although right wing - group i associate with - has lots of those people), because Ben Shapiro thought me that 👍🏻 there are lots of agnostics or atheists out there and you will not persuade them with the Bible"

1.0," King Stop blaming Trump for an uncontrollable airborne virus. That's like saying every countries President is to blame for the deaths in their countries as well. Get a clue, clueless! Will you blame Pelosi for going on national television and telling everyone there's nothing to fear back when we first heard of Covid-19?"
1.0,Because democrats own most media outlets. When Twitter won’t let your now President speak you should know something is horribly wrong with this. When you don’t get to hear the other side to make your own assumption of what’s going on. You now have a taste of losing your freedom.

1.0,lol Bill never paid a dime himself Fox did lol. And those were defamation settlements basically because the accusers couldn't prove shit in court but if they went public with their bogus claims it would have had an impact on his show's ratings and pressured advertisers to withdraw their ad buys. The Murdochs basically cut their losses because it is cheaper settling then losing ad revenue that likely would go beyond just Bill's show. Waste money I call it business.

Then watch as leftist thugs censor social media, invent thought crimes, and attack the 2nd amendment.  Now they want to enslave you to the Chinese and corporate America for a buck.

Meanwhile what Fox did to Trump in comparison to other news outlets during Obama years was probably just talking nicely Trump's pepe compared to other MSM going full grapefruit blowjob on Obamas."
0.0,"Allow me to disagree.  Minimum wage is directly targeted at service and low tech companies that lobby to keep it low.  

UBI is directed at citizens not companies so corporations would be called out very quickly if they tried to lobby against or otherwise thwart the system."

0.0,We already know this. Nothing changes that republicans voted to not hold trump accountable.

1.0,"I don’t care about anything right now except the Supreme Court. If he votes for Kavanaugh great. If he doesn’t then shame on him. There’s zero reason to believe her or others at this point.

And ask Chris Christie how sucking up to the media works out for ya... I would have gone with McCain but that’s kinda low"

0.0,"Because literally every single investigation, and every single court challenge, showed as much? 
   
If there was widespread voter fraud in the last election, it's incredible that apparently dozens of courts, including judges appointed by Trump, are in on the conspiracy."

0.0,I've been ready since being voting age the other two don't have my vote especially last election with the Conservative idiot.
0.0,"Just vote and help those in need. Encourage others to vote to help the needy. Appeal to conservatives by talking about our support of small and local businesses, we're generally protectionists and support a capitalist economic system. Appealing to liberals is much easier. We're usually socially progressive and tend to think that racism is bad. Know your audience and you can make a positive difference.

The top 1% paid 38% of the total income taxes, yet make up 21% of the income.  If we were all paying our fair share, the bottom 50% would (on average) need to triple their income tax rates."

Won loads of seats in the house, have a super majority in the supreme court, a conservative judicial branch for at least a decade, blue states losing house seats from the census, and old Joe so radical that 2022 is going to be a bloodbath for conservatives."

0.0,"He'd have to be very aggressive for the $15 right now since some center-leftists don't want it nationally. Hell freaking 8 Democrats voted against it in the Senate. Seems like he's pushing for it but more methodically. It'll burn up his political capital, but fair point. 

I really didn't expect something like the infrastructure package on top of the relief package so that was a pleasant suprise that went above my low expectations."
0.0,"Sorry about the titlegore, but Republicans are not trying to make voting easy."
1.0,"Nothing has changed. Otherwise, we would have a pile of Democrats in prison right now. The letter agencies are extremely partisan. The evidence is in who gets investigated and who doesn't.  
  
The fact that you said the double standard has been changed is not apolitical. Indeed, it's **very** political. Again, look at who is getting raided and who gets softball interviews where they're not having to give statements under oath. There's no question it's political in nature."

1.0,"Another Democrat using the 3 letter gov agencies to take out their rivals. Sound familiar? Let me give you a hint... Hitler, Stalin, Pol-Pot, Amin, ... get the picture? Every regime in history has used the government agencies to take out their opposition. Their doctrine cannot stand the light of day, or criticism! It fades when exposed!

Where is the MSM? Crickets!"
0.0,"She’s fighting for her state and I respect her too. To me, money in politics is such an important issue that I wouldn’t want to elevate someone’s career who is on the wrong side of it. The only chance we have for special interests to lose their rule over this country is for people to stop voting for candidates funded by them."
0.0,No because I'm a white-collar worker in the US and white-collar unions are all but non-existent here.
0.0,"The first can be mitigated through good welfare and labour policy (as seen in the Nordic Model), the second isn't inherent to corporations but rather to post-Industrial Revolution human society (the USSR and the Aral Sea are good examples of this), the third can once again be mitigated through good social policy without having to throw out the baby with the bathwater."

1.0,"How did she cause Dems to lose 2 State Senate seats and 13 state house seats? Seems kinda hard to blame that on one Senate candidate, especially when it seems that Republicans were doing acceptably good throughout the US (flipped a bunch of House seats and whatnot). I mean, it seems her campaign wasn't great, but I didn't hear much about it being super toxic or anything."
1.0,"Fair point. The Senate went through all that trouble with their parliamentarian to determine they could run a second reconciliation bill this fiscal year to ‘modify’ the earlier reconciliation bill, and….. nothing. I typically prefer divided government because nothing gets done. Turns out single-party rule under Democrats is pretty similar to divided government."
1.0,I take it you've never encountered the 50 Cent Army on Twitter before.  Go back to Twitter and write up something nice about any Republican you want and watch it get downvoted into oblivion.  Come to think of it they're also rather active on several subreddits such as as well.  Most of the ones downvoting you will be either bots or the 50 Cent Army who mainly get paid for writing pro-China stuff but they will also do it for the Democratic Party and against Republicans.
