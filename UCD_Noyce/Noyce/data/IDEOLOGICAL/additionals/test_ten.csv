2,"I saw an interview with Larry Elder. He said that if he is elected legally he can appoint an empty Senator seat. One of the Senator's has hinted of retiring. If that person leaves office, Larry Elder can appoint a Senator. If that happens, Republicans gain the majority in the Senate. So Democrats are doing everything they can to avoid that situation."
1,Newsom is garbage take out the trash before it sits there and smell worst .
2,"He said that the UK paid reparations to the slave owners, not that the US should. You are lying (again)... but your vehement arguing lacks logic. And you look down to (black) people... like a ""stolz Hausmeister"" and a ""Vizehausmesterin""..."
2,Cenk thinks rape of animals is ok on record
2,You think this is bad... Candace Owens speaking on slavery in a recent Prager U video was even worse.
1,Tyt might be the most racist so called news ever. The Democrats are the founders and promoters of the kkk do they not know history?
2,"So this is what I worry about‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve followed TYT for years, but recently they made a very convenient edit to videos from Jimmy Dore, regarding alleged sexual harassment towards Ana Kasparian. As I stated before, I‚Äôm not a fan of jimmy Dore at all, but his comments were about Kasparian being unprofessional with her work attire, and framing it as a joke. What he said was, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a nice ‚Äúnews‚Äù skirt‚Äù‚Äî  They played a clip of Dore saying, (this is not verbatim) ‚Äúi made her feel terrible, and ashamed‚Ä¶ I did that‚Äù ‚Äî then the clip stops and Cenk calls him a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù. Right after the clip cuts off, Dore finishes his comment by explaining how terrible it was that he made her feel that way, and then he apologized. 
‚Äî‚Äî with that said, I‚Äôm voting for Newsom, don‚Äôt like Elder, but I‚Äôm very curious about what he said after the clip stopped, because it was very abrupt. Elder doesn‚Äôt seem like he is advocating for paying slave owners reparations. The point he seems to be making is that it was legal to have slaves, so if reparations were paid out, an argument could be made for the slave owners receiving reparations as well. He didn‚Äôt sound like he was advocating for that, but just making a point on reparations as a whole. If I were to make a guess, he was making an argument against reparations, not making a point that slave owners should be paid as well."
0,A new low for Elder. Saying this to attract white votes is his style.  And there is Owens his female twin. Cali elect him and lookout. Whites want him to do the dirty work. Which he will gladly do. This all started with his hatred of his father. His own father.
2,"Did TYT Forget before the Civil War the government's wanted to buy all the slaves then free them? 
      Then again they can't even be honest and just say how dare this black man say something that's against us."
2,Larry knows how to win over white people as do many black far right conservatives. It‚Äôs good for business.
2,Why don't you guys give 220 thousands dollars of cash from my account to pat Lockhart as a bonus for putting up with being an American at an inconvenient time for people who know what they are talking about? I already authorized the transaction effective today? He's earned it. He could do what none of you ever could.
1,"Yes, Reparations. Taking money from people who never owned slaves and giving it to people who never were slaves. 
What about white americans from the north whose ancestor probably died fighting to free the slaves? Or black people today whose ancestor's owned slaves? Or what about mixed racial people - would a black person with a white slave owner ancestor have to pay? What about a white person with a black slave ancestor, would they receive money? 
The rabbit hole of reparations makes no sense and is widely open for abuse and perpetuating resentment that should have died decades ago. That's Elders point. You're either too stupid to understand that or are deliberately misrepresenting him so you can smear him."
2,*yawn* Howabout reparations for all the TYT Cult Followers that gave you money...so Hasan Piker could buy a $2.7M home.
0,"What's ridiculous is that many conservatives tout Candice and Elder as representatives of the black community...all you have to do is look at the majority of their supporters. They're not even supported by their own demographic. If black people don't show up for them, ya can't say they are representative. üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
0,"Larry is making money off of this and Newsom will win. 
K I S S"
2,When WWII was over the USA established the GI Bill to help soldiers realize the American dream of home ownership. The USA gave it to  the proud men that fought for this country and risked death for our freedoms. However if you were black you were denied. This is the type of country America has always been.
2,Another hit piece on a black man. Shame on you.

1,You leftists are completely racist and he never said that slave owners should get reparations. Larry elder was attacked in a gorilla mask by leftist and people like you support it. You never cared about black lives and hate black people who think for ourselves Leftists are the biggest racist.
0,"People like Larry Elder make me sick. Does he really believe that if he were living in the south during the slave days, he wouldn't have been captured and sold just every other black man was."
1,"The young turks are missing Mr. elders point all together. Intentionally. Mr. Elder is pointing out the absurdities one encounters when going down the rabbit hole of reparations.

Elder opened my eyes on the matter. Made me contemplate some important questions and consider things I had not considered. 

Would Rachel dolezal get reparations? Would Oprah Winfrey? Obama? Kamala Harris? When today there are FAR more poverty stricken white people in America than any other people. Do all black people get reparations even though many NEVER had relatives who were enslaved? What about those black people whose families were actually slave OWNERS? There were many. Who pays these reparations? All white people? All citizens whether they had anything to do with the slave trade or not? Republican families who sacrificed their own flesh and blood to liberate the slaves and end the infamous traffic? People whose families never even lived in the country until maybe 100 years after the infamous traffic of slavery had ended? They owe, too? The South was home to 250,000 free blacks. Do their descendants get reparations, too? There were ~4000 black slave owners owning more than 20,000 slaves. How does that figure into ‚ÄúReparations‚Äù?¬†Since the country‚Äôs founding 306,000 slaves were brought here, but since slavery ended more than 2,000,000 black Africans have come here by choice... another 1,000,000 Black Americans came here by choice and by way of the Caribbean. how does THAT figure into reparations?

Because of Larry elder it now seems to me that the only proper way to handle the inequities of the past is to make sure that our laws are just TODAY. That they‚Äôre applied equally to every citizen. To continue to provide access to opportunity WITHOUT favoring or handicapping ANY racial group.¬†I think that‚Äôs the best we‚Äôve got."
2,People please Don‚Äôt vote for a man who clearly is twisted in the head ü§™
0,larry elder is just playing to the GOP base. white racists love to pretend they are the victims.
0,"Black Republicans and conservatives shouldn't have any power at all anywhere, or even have any freedoms here in America because there white supremacist."
2,legality vs ethics. just because something is legal doesnt necessarily make it right. just because something is illegal doesnt necessarily make it wrong.
2,"I discriminated against a New Mexican boy the other day. Not gonna lie, felt pretty good."
2,"How about we focus on important things, reason race is an issue is because ppl can't stop talking about it.  How about dealing with  sex trade of children.  Yall are idiots"
2,I'm a Progressive and voted Yes to recall that evil Disney cartoon character Gavin Newsom.
2,He sounds dumb after you lose a war when are you paid anything doesn‚Äôt the loser usually pay? You pay for the other side not to come back and kick your ass again‚Ä¶
2,"So if people were property and it was legal how were they included in the constitution as ""WE THE PEOPLE"" when were not included.ü§îü§îü§î"
2,Dumb sh1t people say. BUT The definition or reparation is simply righting a wrong thats whatvwe need to understand first and realize most people are referring to money and don't know wtf they are talking about.
2,TYT you're dome for speaking on a country that's been around  for thousands of years with their own way of life  their own culture America has  been around how long? the arrogance sometimes I think you people just like to hear yourself talk cuz you're not solving shit  just running your mouth!!
1,"A conversation about the optics of this,  I think is wrong. The Taliban maybe bad but there is nothing in this clip which is I haven't seen on or advocated on US TV. It's their right to bear arms, they weren't pointing their guns at the anchor so I don't see the problem. If like me they have been watching US TV over the last few years they would believe it'll be foolish not to have a gun on them at any point"
2,"What were they thinking? They did not. That is their usual aesthetics for when someone holds a camera and so they used it. Probably will change where the less brain dead have a say but that is probably just it. No messaging intented - nothing intented, just mindless. Not that being controlled by mindless people with absolute power was any good. Just saying that it is probably not contious messaging."
2,Unibrow needs grooming tips.
0,"sounds like trump 101. Act right, do wrong ü§£"
2,Well‚Ä¶. These completely UnEducated caveman idiots have takin control. WoW!   Really???  This could have been avoided had the powers just continuously dropped bombs on the mountains or ‚Äúknown‚Äù underground housing and tunnel systems. Instead catering to them and pretending that this wasnt going to happen. It was ALLLLL planned!   If you think any differently youre a fool.    Look at how easy its been and how we are playing nice while those animals are killing innocent people. The Taliban are the scum of the earth  ( . )     The only way its ends is to kill them all  &   You all know it. Animals go extinct all the time. What‚Äôs different now?
2,"Religion will poison your mind, but if one religion will poison your mind worse than all others, it is Islam."
0,"It doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter if the Taliban is awful. Saudi Arabia is beyond awful, and you guys just gave them billions of dollars in weapons. Trump bragged about it being the biggest weapons deal in history. United States supports right-wing fascist dictators all over the planet right now as of this moment. No country on Earth has more blood on its hands than the United States."
2,I agree with Cenk üíØ%
2,Death to the Taliban
2,"The US didn't ""create"" the Taliban, the US and other nations funnelled money into Afghanistan to help the Mujahideen fight the Soviets, it's arrogant to say the US ""created"" the Taliban, tell it as it happened."
2,"He is actually saying that the President and other government officials have fled the country and now the country is back in the hands of Taliban. I did not hear him say ""don't worry"""
2,"This is what happens when you put literally Neanderthals weapons and power. Seriously though, take a screenshot of the cavemen in the back and take a screenshot of an actual rendering of a Neanderthal and put them together. Tell me these aren't literal cavemen!"
1,These so-called journalists in America should look at this and see what they are actually doing while these American journalist sit here and almost defend these people it's sickening to see what the news media and turned into they are the press for the Democrat Party there is no longer any biased news outlets
2,"Nice to see presenters actively disagree with each other on the video in a spontanious way. Immediately the honesty of the presenters shine through. With TYT, at least you can tell while they have an Ideological view that informs their reporting style. They're not actively trying to BS their audience."
2,Islam is the religion of peace.
2,"We allow women to go to school/ university but only with female proffesors.

No, because women were not allowed to go to school  previously."

2,"Reminds me of the Mexican cartel videos, except the cartel hit men wear face coverings."
2,"The US should stop f***ing around, the US acts like that all the countries in the world are some whores and it can f**k any one whenever it want. What the US did to Vietnam, Cambodia, Iraq, Syria, Libya etc , what it got from it??? üòÅ Running pants-less!!!! And now from Afghanistan.
 You should all be ashamed of yourselves. You aren't police of the world you are just another f***ing country that should mind its own business. It took you more than 200 years to get rights to your black people. Keep calm and let the natural process of change in other countries too.    You f***ing morons"
0,I've never heard anyone from NBC or CBS or even ABC say a word about loving war. Nor have I heard that on any other news channel. I don't what CONservative media so I don't know what they say about war. I think someone needs a vacation to unplug from the craziness for a while.
2,News Flash their terrorists and we armed them to the teeth!
2,Jenk is getting to the heart of the matter between positive punishment and negative punishment. The gun wielding psychos will positively put a bullet in your head if you don't do what they say the checkbook wielding psychos will negatively affect your bank account leaving you destitute and wishing that there was a bullet in your head.

0,"Talibans are conservatives morons that believe that the end justify the means, they probably also believe that Covid19 vaccine and mask mandates should be banned."
2,"They should not be afraid of the Taliban, even though they are obviously forcing me to say this at gun point.... how stupid."
0,"This will be the mainstream media if we let trump and his racist thugs Republicants get back into office.  Except their name will be called the ""Tali-KLAN""."
0,This is what is going to happen in the USA.  if we let Trump supporters take over the government.  Just take a look at their policies and it matches the taliban.
2,"Yikes!! That Taliban member, to the left of camera, his eyes did all the talking!!!üëÄüò≥"

2,They are on drugs.
0,"Oh Ana, you open with a question that presupposes that religious zealots think rationally. Haven't you seen enough of the Christian Taliban here in the US to know better?"
2,"That‚Äôs pretty scary. 
What our news would have looked like if Rump had won."
2,"CENK! I admire you but the way you silenced Ana here was prettier horrendous. This was after all a section introduced and presented by her about the Taliban literally holding new media hostage in Afghanistan. You decided to steal the segment by turning it into an attack on your American media rivals. When Ana tried to respond to this you cut her off repeatedly and then said ""hold on"" which suggests you will allow her to respond at the end. But once you made your point you ended the section without allowing her any retort. 
The Taliban taking total control of the media is an important story but you dismissed it and silenced Ana voice by wagging your finger at her and then holding your hand up to silence her in a very dictatorial fashion. 
This came off terribly. I'm not saying this as some sort of fan of Ana, I actually think she too often doesn't do her due diligence before reporting on a story and it clearly shows but as a boss I would never raise my voice to literally drown out the voice of a female staff member while wagging my finger at her and then use the ""stop!"" hand gesture to silence them. You are meant to be a progressive.
I hope you read this as that was very dictatorial behaviour and is a nasty window into your workplace behaviour."
0,Saudi Arabia created the Taliban. And Bush helped them. And Trump owes MBS millions.
2,One should not be afraid of zealots intent on killing you?
2,...........................................What do you guys really know is happening?

2,jokes on you guys. there were no bullets in those guns.
2,"STOP! The US did not help the Taliban while fighting the Soviets, they helped the Mujahideen, who in turn got defeated by the Taliban. 

Also, I am sure that this reporter would prefer being held ""hostage"" by receiving millions of $ from the Taliban and being threatened with no further donations."

2,"A gun for a taliban fighter is like their arm or leg. After all this time fighting, it‚Äôs just a part of them. I don‚Äôt even think they considered how it would come across, because it‚Äôs just there with them, throughout it all, whether with intention or not."
0,"Oh my god.  I hope they weren‚Äôt Islamophobic and they used the right pronouns because that‚Äôs the main thing, right?"
2,"I can't imagine how effective this would be. 
The Afghans have eyeballs, and can see the actual chaos & destruction around them."

2,Corrupt reporting of news is an even bigger problem.
2,This one police chief can't speak for all.  He's just as ignorant as ol' Walter.
2,those police mans must in federal court to sentence to death. think at those man who sentenced arnold schwarzenegger to death in california for killing womans. this persons - killers was policemans.  this is real life. law is law. if not sentence those mans to death this is crime against humanity with policians whos are in this affaire likewise in. what get a man if with this police chief after bankrobbing this do? from police mans? or from court? especially if this chief is inocent?

2,"Unfortunately, this ...umm... ""police chief"" didn't understand that the Trump quote was directed at the govdrnors on the phone call.  Not at anybody else, and not at the police.  

But hey, you don't have to be a genius to be a  ""police chief"" when the staunchest ally of police that ever occupied the Whitehouse was the guy you are bad mouthing."

2,"Most of these big city ‚Äúchiefs‚Äù are political hacks, shuffled around from city to city as a de facto Federalization of local police forces. I‚Äôm glad to live where the chiefs are still pulled from the ranks."

2,if this guy run i will vote for him
2,Police Chief Art Acevedo is the best leader and I am a big fan.
2,"Great police chief,  he 100% right."
2,A wise man. We all need 2 come together... We have become a divided nation!!!üò¢
2,"This man is one of the reasons I respect people who serve our country with honor and respect. I‚Äôm not just talking about people who wear the uniforms eitherüòí. Chief Acevedo made a good point where our problems lie. If you want things to change in your favor then you need to vote for it. Also, I know that this is old news but I really don‚Äôt understand why people always think violence is the answer. Look what this worldwide riot sparked from. Police brutality. I happen to respect the police department but when there is an officer who uses unnecessary force or worse goes against all protocol and what has been taught, then I lose that respect. Trump‚Äôs answer during this crazy situation was to ‚Äúdominate‚Äù. I was disappointed not just because of how he spoke to the governors but also that he decided to use force as a first solution. should never be a first solution, no matter the circumstances. Here‚Äôs why. First depending on who you‚Äôre picking a fight with and how many, they might beat you senseless. Second all you are doing is making yourself look like the bad guy which is okay if you‚Äôre trying to conquer someplace but not such a good a idea to do with your own nation. Finally we have a thing called diplomacy. Ever heard it? Been around since the Roman Imperial Era? It doesn‚Äôt just apply with political agendas, if you know the country then it applies just as well to the public. Talking things out isn‚Äôt a guarantee, especially in the ‚Äúfree country‚Äù, but in emergency situations it‚Äôs a better first option than sending the National Guard. Violence is always met with more violence."
2,What should people do when we are physically threatened by those who are not peaceful towards us?
2,"So proud of you Mr. Acevedo...1 because you were chief here in Austin, TX, where I reside, 2 because you are now chief in Houston, where I was born & raised, 3 because you are an Orgullo Latino, 4 because you are a big hearted human being & I can just go on & on...anyways. God bless u always, Mr. Acevedo üôèüèΩ"
0,Trump always likes to act like he's the best friend the police could ever ask for. It's very relieving to hear to this man to set him straight.
2,No cop they stepped into the danger willingly when they got hired leadership hmm stop whining an lead then

Since it is very important,  so every State Capital and national guard can stop the mad attacks from Trumpiests who are armed and dangerous. I pray Joe Biden and Kamila Harris take over White House in peace. But before that all who are protectors of state capitol and our democracy should remove these dangerous organizations asap. 
Please watch this:

2,"I'm sorry I have to say this but most Americans still look at black people as former slaves. It's a part of our national history that we brought slaves to America to work in the fields picking cotton. So we can't change what Americans were taught in school. History is history, like it or not. In my entire life I have never judged a man or woman by the color of their skin. I wasn't brought up that way. But we have to teach our children that it is wrong. People need all the information available to make their decisions on how the country is run. If you start banning books then the public is not getting all the available information and they are unable to make proper decisions."

There have been many instances of book banning throughout history and in many cultures and none of them were good or for good reasons."

Without the book burners who is going to vote for trump. trump is just the John Gotti of Billionaires (he salivates in the spotlight) but everything he truly stands for the ultra rich families back 100%. How else could book burners have so much resources. Google CRT and the first 3 page results are dominated by anti CRT articles. How could they enter candidates for every political and civic office in the country, from small districts to the presidency, sheriff, District Attorney, SCHOOL BOARDS. Parents who like there history honest just set some time aside to learn together with your kids, I recommend the story of Jim Thorpe or the 1936 Berlin with the articles or documentaries that include Jesse Owens African American team mates that won medals of their own and their experience back home."
0,"*There's nothing free or Constitutional about trump or the entire Republicon party!*  Pelosi better not trust the 2 on the Jan 6th investigation, they can't ever be trusted!

What a bunch of lying hypocrites they are. They are doing what  trump accused China of doing to the Uighurs, creating re-education camps and forcing it on the blacks! 

Women in China's ""re-education"" camps for Uighurs have been systematically raped, sexually abused, and tortured. The republicans working in every area in this dysfunctional legal system have been doing the latter for many, many years!

The Hispanics are afraid to say boo and draw attention to themselves, or they'll be the next to go.

2,"Were these books poorly written? Grammer incorrect?  Not labeled as fiction, fantasy, educational correctly? They are books leave them in the libraries. History looks to be repeating itself in the states... lol. Fundamentalists are coming for you.... unvaxx'd even..."
2,This is were states rights gets really annoying. Federalize the truth and be done.
2,"Are you joking‚Ä¶.. this place is so backwards it‚Äôs ASTOUNDING. Honestly flabbergasted  still when I see these  kinds of stories. Teaching culture and history apparently is gonna be up to parents for awhile longer. Too bad half of us are racist morons with hard ons for power and freebies ,with zero contribution to the whole ‚Äús wellbeing."

2,"This raises even more questions, like why do we have white flight whenever too many blacks move into the neighborhood? Black Americans are the living evidence of what happened yesterday, and the lingering effects of slavery and Jim Crow continues to beg for a discussion. Running away won't help the matter any."
0,"Of course they support it-they enabled the first one!  The GOP is completely corrupt, toxic & Trump enablers."

0,"Dear: Republican Party

¬† When it came time to protect America you refused when the Alt-Right and the Neo-Nazis came you kept the door open for them. 

When Trump back these hate groups you protected him, a P.R. statement saying you refuse to support racism, then back Trump's hatemongering declarations the very next day. 

Who are you people to accept racism as a political platform? When David Duke supports Trump you did nothing, just give me my Tax Cuts and my Judges Mr. Trump.¬† 

African Americans are being attacked on the streets by Americans for, cooking, sleeping, shopping by Trump Supporters you could care less. 

When Trump broke the law dealing with Russia you protected him again. 

¬† Meanwhile, the hate groups are getting stronger, Anti-Governments Groups increase, but you Republicans do nothing. 

I say this as an independent voter you have permitted Donald Trump to become an American Dictator to keep your power. 

He Attacked Black Lives Matter for his supremacist racist base, for a Photo Op. 
The Republicans did nothing, Terrorist attacked Michigan's Capital you did nothing to stop Trump. 
Trump told the Proud Boys, I'm with you 
The Republicans did nothing. 
The Capital Has Been Attacked and you have settled back and have allowed Donald Trump and his followers to commit treason.¬† 

I say this to you honestly all of you are cowards to the Ameican People. It might not feel that way with the backing of Right-Wing Media, The Power and Money you have gained. 

We all saw it though, time after time watching you allowing Trump to do anything he wanted. 

A police officer has died and yes every one of you Republicans is to blame for his death, Fox News can't help you spin out of this. 

There is no honor, no integrity, or compassion within your party. 

Why do you ignore white supremacy and their organizations? 

Time won't heal this one, you have shown us who you are and we will never forget. 

Never Forget.

1,"You guys realize the Clinton's, Obama's and Biden's are all above the law, right. It is foolish to expect them to comply with the laws passed for us little people. The last 4 year have proven that our Justice System is so corrupt that some families are in fact, above the law."

2,China's response to economic talks requiring reciprocal treatment was Corona Virus. I will be proven right.
1,What now? Will she be arrested
1,I'm tired of it all put these fools in jail
2,China is asshoe
2,"maybe on the other side, china reports sleepy joe is the worse president in this term"
1,Biden doing the same thing
1,"Newsmax TV, the most war mongering propagandist news source available."
2,"I've been an American citizen for 26 years. During this time I've been following Russian and American news. I understand two perspectives. Americans aren't being told the truth neither about Russia nor China. In fact, with respect to both, Americans are constantly told lies, especially about China. When Trump was saying let's make friends with Russia, I began to think that Trump really wants to free America from the control of the Deep State because making any deals with Russia is what the Deep State doesn't want, be they Neocons or Democrats. Trump acted like Democrats were preventing him from making friends with or even talking to Putin or having a negotiation, meanwhile he imposed sanctions after sanctions against Russia. Then, at the end of Trump's term, he truly waged a massive anti-China information campaign, similar to the one Reagan waged against the USSR. What this tells me is that Trump wanted to fool everyone that he is a nice guy who wants to make friends with Russia and others. This tells me that he is still down with the people who are interested in regime changes in Russia and China and are not interested in negotiations, which means that Trump isn't any better than Bush, Obama, Clinton, etc. He almost fooled me. I thought that Trump was against the DS, but he was with the Neocons. If he wasn't with the Neocons, then he was surrounded by them, which means that he just couldn't really do anything from the get go and he wasn't in control of anything. They only allowed him to do certain things and said no to everything else. It is a 2-party 1-party system and the president is just a puppet, whether it is Trump, Biden, Obama, or Santa Claus."
0,First we must remove China Joe from office or we will be done with free America
2,I'd take Pompeo for President.
1,"President Trump called him to release the email, and he didn‚Äôt. Now he stated to talk about them."
1,"Hillary Clinton to Trump: ""I cant wait to see you in prison.""  Trump Answers: "" I don't think they will allow you visitors."""
2,If Trump runs and wins in 2024 he needs to go scorched earth on every Dem and corrupt Rep in office.  We all understand you have limitations on your first term and that the second term is the time you get to pull all the punches.  Which is why the Dems were shitting their pants and which is why they used the Media to hide their illegal activities and corruption.
2,Hilary Clinton's emails are not on state.gov i was just on the website and see nothing even close.
1,She needs to be in jail
2,C-SPAN Washington Journal swamp media democrat-controlled from top to bottom.
2,There is chatter on the Internet that Hillary Clinton will be swinging from the gallows at GITMO prison tonight after TAPS under a Scorpio full moon. How fitting!?
1,I miss the Trump team
2,Why is that since Biden becomes president no one is talking about how many people dying from covid everyday anymore?
1,Let's see the Hillary emails.
1,This is a time when our leaders put America first and its allies.
2,fox need not worry. The fruits of their labor from throwing the Greatest President in American History under the Bus Is coming True. Know get on your knees and play biden's piccolo. You earned it boys.
2,Maybe she is not arrested because she is already dead or dying of STDs
1,Hilary should be in jail by now
2,How much money did Pompeo and Trump siphon off the billion dollar Saudi arms deal?. Some estimates have Trump making $160 million on that deal and $440 on his there presidencial scams. They√± law will follow the money and find everything in time. Trump is in court the rest of his life.
1,Biden wont hold China  accountable but can . Boycot chinese products .
0,"So what, you did nothing to get all released and the JD has done nothing to prosecute any wrongdoers. Honestly, I have lost all respect for republicans and our non-biased (laugh) JD and FBI. Still waiting on the honest and through Durham Report. America has been betrayed."
1,"Well let's be real here. He doesn't want the vaccine, yes, but he also wants to bank on that pension and I don't blame him one bit"
0,"Gonna be voting Red up and down the ticket 2022 and 2024.
Demorats have shown their true authoritarian face with this vaccine mandate.
Enough is a enough."
2,"BIDEN IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND PEOPLE WITH ALLERGIES ESPECIALLY ONES WHO GET ANAPHYLAXIC REACTIONS REACTIONS SHOULD NOT BE TAKING THE EXPERIMENTAL VACCINES DOCTORS IN ENGLAND WARNED...
THEY ARE EXPERIMENTAL INJECTIONS...
EXPERIMENTAL...
EXPERIMENTS....
NO ONE SHOULD BE FORCED TO BE AN EXPERIMENTAL RAT WHEN THEY HAVE NO CLUE WHAT IT WILL DO TO YOUR HEALTH TEN YEARS DOWN THE ROAD....
IT'S COMMUNIST BEHAVIOR ON BIDENS BEHALF...
IT'S SICKENING...
I WANT HIM OUT OF OFFICE BECAUSE HE'S NOT UPHOLDING THE CONSTITUTION....
FAUCI SHOULD BE IN JAIL TOO...."
1,Guess that 30 year pension helps you turn in the badge  lol
1,Let the corruption system collapse and let's rebuild
2,"Part of my faith in man has been restored. Resist resist resist never stop resisting. What they could do to us is not nearly as bad as what they're attempting to do. Say it proud, say it loud, never stop saying it!."
2,Respect! Thanks for standing up and be counted! I‚Äôm in the same boat with my tech job. I‚Äôll be let go next week for my refusal to get vaccinated.
2,That cop is a freaking hero. It takes a brave man to risk everything to stand up for the very principles this country was founded on.
1,"They are forcing good, strong, humble people like this man to choose between standing and kneeling. They‚Äôre goal is to make us stand, so we can be eradicated. They want only the sheep to be left. I say we give them what they want."
2,Thank You for your service and for your bravery in facing this outrageous mandate. Biden is out of control. They are not mandating the people at the borders . a bunch of hypocrites
2,They are just sorting whose loyal to the party or not.
1,"Resigning doesn‚Äôt help hurt them, though. Make them fire you and then sue their butts!"
2,All hail our new fascist government.
2,Why would anyone take a experimental ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù for a virus that has  99% + survival rate?
2,Tank you and god  is here‚Ä¶you fight for all fathers‚Ä¶
1,Adolph Biden.
2,"Ainsley sounds like a good hearted patriot, too bad she works for a corporation that forces their employees to get the jab!"
1,"This is a brave, humble true man.
He is gutted you can hear in his voice, because ppl are frightened of a flu infection.
It is ALL about power and control"
1,"So they're not really ""Blue Lives"" if you can decide to just quit one day."
2,Vaccines have always been mandated for the military and schools for as long as I remember. Same in hospitals and the medical field for certain vaccines. I had to get the Hep B vaccine to work in Trauma.
2,We will stand against tyranny this is one way to defund the police and all first responders just like the Jackass party they want this country to be weak amd broken thank you sir for standup sad you have to give up your job
0,"We are armed and have supplies. 

When the police and military quit over this.....

Who is going to provide security??

Waiting patiently for the invasion to happen"
2,To go along with evil just to keep your job shows what god this world serves. Its eye opening when you see and realize how people go along to get along.  Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act. Remember this was all designed to do what its doing and its working perfectly. God bless this man for his faith in the Almighty.
2,Buck Fiden!
2,Thank you for standing against a mandatory vaccine.I will quit if they try to force a vaccine on me.This is straight up tyranny. Dont fall for their lies and control.
1,Come down to Florida where you will be employed and respected and protected under Governor DeSantis!!!  Thank you for your service sir!!
1,Biden setting the stage for country to be invaded by foreign UN sponsored military by having our military quit.   He should be removed from office
1,All these idiots that are putting these untested drugs in their bodies are going to regret it.
1,"Even if ur not religious, u hafta respect this man‚Äôs strength of character and principles. He‚Äôs made quite a large sacrifice, n my estimation, to stand up for what he believes n. And that n and of itself is worthy of respect."
1,"This is how they remove people that MAY be conservative or republican from their jobs because let‚Äôs face it it‚Äôs the opinion of the leftists and dems that only trump supporters and republicans are against this vaccine which really isn‚Äôt true, people across the board are against the vaccine mandate not necessarily the vaccine. I‚Äôm a part time Uber and Lyft driver and today while working I met a woman who lost some of her sight and became partially paralyzed a couple days after taking the second dose of the vaccine and her doctor admitted it was almost certainly from the vaccine but these doctors aren‚Äôt reporting these cases so there really is legitimacy to peoples concerns about this vaccine and the government and businesses shouldn‚Äôt be putting mandates in place that essentially force people to get vaccinated or lose their jobs."
2,We live in a communist country
1,"what if they say no more pension without ""vaccination""?"
1,"God bless you, Sgt. Gutierrez, and thank you for your service to our nation!"
1,He lived in nutty California what did he expect?!  Proud of him for doing this.
2,These  SEALS are stupid.  No sympathy to this man if he gets COVID.
1,"2015 he made $282,000+ in  2017 he made $332,000+ in 2019 he made $367,000+ in  I agree with his decision and don't agree with being forced to accept a vaccine but for him to play poor mouth as if he won't survive is BS as I'm sure he'll be fine living on retirement."
0,"Great, let's just wreck our military now.  The cops wrecked themselves a long time ago by being tyrants."
1,"They are pushing the best out of the military and police department.  
Biden should be arrested for treason , I 100% believe he and CONGRESS LEFT AND RIGHT are willfully causing this country to collaps.  

Our best pilots are quiting , Navy seals and other people who are red blooded Americans ....

This nation is in danger ."
2,When you lose your best and brightest only bad stuff can happen. And this is just what the left wants well I guess there really is going to have to be community policing neighbors protecting neighbors from Biden supporters
1,This man is my hero! I too will not get the vax! I support him 100%!
1,"As much as I applaud these polices officers and military personnel, and support them fully, it scares me that more and more are quitting. Soon we will have nothing but leftist snowflakes left in law enforcement and our military."
1,Understood and I applaud him but he served 30 years and is more than able to walk away with his pension. A lot of younger police officers can‚Äôt do this and it sucks.
1,Our jobs are like our family are people at our jobs we love the people at our jobs we love their families we love their children we interact with people children we don't want to see people suffer for something that's that's could have been handled earlier everybody blaming everybody this is not Trump for we love Trump do not blame this on Trump I'm not having it no one I mean no one will blame this mess up Joe did on Trump we love Trump we love Trump
2,"What a shame. I wonder how many good officers like him we are losing every day due to lying doctors, hospitals, Biden gang of thugs, Dr. FAUCHI & the Wuhan lab . .  Thank you sir, for standing up like a MAN for the better of ALL."
1,If we could all stand this man wouldn't have to sacrifice his lively hood!!!  If you sit back till this affects your life it will be to late!!!!
1,"Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.  c.s. lewis"
2,"This mandate won‚Äôt last long. When city employees start leaving and no one fills that void, things will only get worse. When restaurants start to close, this‚Äôll go away. Good on this man and all of the others that stood up for what‚Äôs is right."
2,"Find out what Luc Montagnier, the man that discovered the HIV virus, says about this vaccine! He is one of the most brilliant minds we have and they won‚Äôt publish what he says because they don‚Äôt want us to know the truth!!!"
2,"Everyone is missing the entire point.
The tyrants want all the free thinking, freedom minded cops and military to quit.
That way when the tyrants turn the police and military against citizens; they will have only ones that will follow orders."
2,This is what I think when I see this video. Look at how these vaccine mandates are weakening our military and police force. Doesn‚Äôt it make you wonder maybe it‚Äôs being done on purpose?
2,GOD BLESS THIS MAN!!! HE WILL PREVAIL!!!! THIS IS LUNACY!!!!
1,This is a national emergency and in your heart is so big and your heart is so beautiful that you're not putting money before your job like so many others are doing and putting others at risk God bless you and thank you for saving me thank you for saving me if nobody appreciate you I love you and thank you for saving me sir
2,"Thank you for your bravery to speak out and thank you for your service, in my mind a hero in the true sense of this much misused word"
2,"This JUST happened to me at work yesterday! I am in the healthcare field in New York. I received my threat email from HR, and my practice manager was cc'd on it. I need my job, so i went ahead and got the vaccine.  Im so upset and heated over this illegal action. Our deadline is here at Montefiore Medical Center. Our union 1199 did nothing! They didn't fight hard for us as a matter of fact, it was very weak. Bless this guys heart. ‚ù§üôè"
2,"Every council member, every mayor, every petty tyrant abusing the 13th amendment by taking a proprietary interest in our bodies should be given a fair trial and a fine hanging."
2,"He makes a good point , when anarchy engulfs a nation and there is not enough police officers to help, 
Who are they going to call ?"

1,Keep racism and marxism out of schools. Critical Race Theory IS racism. It separates white from every other color. End of argument.
2,"Trickle-down ecomonic policy fails a shift in market (computer automation).
Automation dominates production and unstoppable.
Jobs are considered waste with automation, targets for removal.
Market doesn't create jobs like before, why taxes should be raised to pay for new jobs and infrustructure.
Trickle-down ignores that critical effect of computer automation, fuels inflation to give a boost to job loss from automation.
No compelling reason for citizens to pay for automation job-recovery with inflation when it's good times for market(automation).
Automation is good thing, saves time and gains more value than gold.

We allow politicians to invest in automation, they gain more despite job loss so it goes ignored.
Adding the 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution would fix it, end corruptton and trickle-down policy.
