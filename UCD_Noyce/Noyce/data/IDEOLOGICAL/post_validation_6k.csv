1,Way to incite violence Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A mistake that cost someone their life and was admitted to by the cop. End of story.
1,Just another reminder that it’s a dangerous profession being a criminal and resisting arrest. Let’s hold the criminals as accountable as we all want police to be.
1,"It was an unfortunate accident. At the end of the day the main lesson that should be learned from all of these unfortunate events is, ( stop resisting arrest). It will never end well. You fight the arrest in court, not on the street. Stop pointing the finger and take some personal accountability.
If you really want to lead Ms. Cortez, then this should be your message. I know you have good intentions, but you're going at this from the wrong direction."
1,Tip of the day: Don’t fight with the police if you don’t want to get shot.
1,"But all you do is talk, Bernie, you don't do anything about it"
1,"“Saving the planet.”

That statement is so moronic. Nothing humans can do can save the planet. Be responsible, teach good practices, but no amount of money paid to the government will have any impact on improving or changing the environment."
1,How long is too long. To long for a politician to be in office and do nothing? You Bernie have done nothing. So leave.
1,"As of the latest Gallup poll, Biden only has a 43 percent approval rating. So, whether you like it or not, the American people are not on your side. Time and time again, we've seen that the REAL America is far more conservative than the media would have us believe. McConnell and his party know they can stall until the midterms because they have more support than you. And you have to wonder how long it's going to take for progressives to accept that fact and learn to work with conservatives to get things done instead of always being adversarial and accomplishing almost nothing."
1,"How much is Too Much when you're talking about the gross overtaxation laws that senators like you and Warren want to sneak in to the infrastructure bill that applies specifically to Cryptocurrency?

1,Joe Biden is a threat to our future. He's done nothing to address climate change or universal Healthcare. In fact he's just as bad as Trump when it comes to sending away refugees. No more status quo. We need radical change. Now.
1,"Bernie, you have been part of the system your entire adult life. And you have allowed this to happen. Shame on you!! Fix it now!"
1,Bernie Sanders How? making empty threats is easy. Actually doing something has yet to be seen.
1,Most innovative pharmaceutical industry in the world. Don’t destroy it with your class warfare. You are too old to benefit from that innovation but it could help billions; unless you destroy it like all things people like you do when they are empowered
1,"Comrade Bernie will you PLEASE stop with your lies !! Honest to hell you are starting to get the poor broke and stupid community convinced you are actually working for them.

Comrade Bernie EVERYONE reading your post is laughing because we all know you’re not doing a damn thing and absolutely NOTHING is going to change. Absolutely NOTHING!!

The same low life members of the poor broke and stupid community will check their food stamp balance on their 700.00 smart phones. Pay $400 or more a month for a care and yet think they shouldn’t pay for medication

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
1,Bernie You and your fellow Democrats in Congress have been the main part of the problem for 40 years. So please do not try to lie and say you actually want to do something about the very mess you have been a huge part in making all these years. That is the sad part is you have fooled people into actually believing your lies. Those people acting like fools have only made you richer and richer than the 1% that you pretend to be against. People who support Bernie and who support Democrats are only making the 1%ers richer and richer and causing a further gap in the income inequality.
1,"Bernie, did you ever suckle from the $$$ teet offered by a lobbyist? I don't expect an honest answer from you."
1,Why isnt congress doing more to cap campaign contributions? Why are you allowing congress to be bribed? Why arent you furious that Biden froze the legislation to reduce costs?
1,"Bernie, you're a rich, fear-mongering tool. Most of what you post is lies. America will never be a communist country, no matter how hard you try. Now, how about you open up your 3 homes to illegals and the homeless??"

0,That level of greed should be considered unlawful but Capitalism is more important than working Americans somehow.
1,"The entire pandemic is due to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. People like your buddy FAUCI who sought gain of function... in this case the function was to make every single person “worth” the cost of their experimental drug. Now those very same greedy asshats have turned every living human, into a cash cow."
1,Well one of the first things Biden did was repeal trumps executive order which had reduced the cost for millions of Americans. You supported Biden and let the establishment win. Now millions are back to paying high insulin prices. You want our support ? 😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡
1,"Go talk to joe, prices were lower when trump was in office 👀, clown."
1,"Yet another bold face lie by the bullshitting Senator from Vermont, according to the US department of health 96.3% of Americans have health insurance that covers prescriptions. Senator my private insurance ( the same insurance I provide my full time employees) cost $193.80 per month

As a T1 diabetic for over 40 years my Lantus and Aspart insulin cost me $3 per box or $6 per month !! And has for more than a decade"
1,Big Pharm saved the world with vaccines. Big business saved the world in WWll. Sanders is a senile neo-Marxist

1,"Two Afghans Brought to U.S. Charged with Child Sex Crimes, Strangling Wife While Living on WI Military Base///"

1,Laurie McWilliams Bernie is the biggest chickenshit when it comes to calling out corrupt politicians. Guess why?
1,Donald Trump did something about that and he was not beholden to drug company donors. He did more being in Washington 4 years than you have done in 3 decades Bernie Sanders . He was well on his way to fixing high drug prices but Washington needed to get ride of him. He was never one of the good ole boys so he had to go. Politician talked of solving problems and Trump did not. He did not talk about problems he solved hem. Bernie; all you ever accomplished was talk.
1,Bernie supporters are in a dangerous cult.
1,"Good old Bern. Won't scream for better diets and exercise, no no it makes too much sense 😂 He'll bitch and yell about prices for meds that will never fix you though, keeping you sick to benefit his pocket-fillers over at Kaiser 😎"
1,So why did your appointed president raise the price of insulin after our President Trump cut them??
1,"Well Bernie, manufacturers get threatened by socialized medicine countries that if they don’t sell at whatever cost those countries want to pay, that they’ll steal the formulations and have China make them for nothing. Depriving the manufacturers of their intellectual property, investment return, worthwhile risk, and return on costly research. Often times forcing those companies to sell drugs below cost rather than being put out of business. The US couldn’t care less about protecting innovations and intellectual property abroad so those companies have to make a profit somewhere. That all being said, you are highly full of 💩 as usual not sharing free and substantially lower prices that your followers could receive (yes, WITHOUT insurance). I wonder how much innovation in medicine we’d have if we didn’t have incentives for companies to make new medical progress. I sure bet a socially managed drug world would stifle the advancement that these companies do and create. Focus on stopping your comrades in other countries and the white house from stealing from innovators and make them all pay their fair share. Why is there never any substance, background or solutions that exist that you can share? Greed my ass. Explain the dynamics and why what happens does. Hint: drug companies need to turn a profit and take on tremendous amounts of risk, failure, and loss. Protect American companies from getting robbed by socialist country extortion artists, defend intellectual property, and the prices will come down. You have such a presence and platform that could be used for good. All you do is fear monger instead of providing existing solutions and support for innovation. Socialist America is its own worst enemy. I wonder how many people you kill each year by convincing them it’s hopeless when there are options for them to get their medications for next to nothing or free."
1,"Bernie, you forgot to add the tax that we had to pay so that you could get your $12.00 insulin."

Bloomberg said so on tv."

The problem can be easily solved by *removing* regulations, not adding them."

1,Nah. This is who we are. Fuck Joe Biden.
1,"> Since covid and andrew yang the voices for universal basic income have multiplied in all countries not just the us of a.

The problem of course, is that the math doesn't work on UBI, and never has.  If you're a fan of science fiction, I strongly recommend the Honor Harrington series by David Weber.  It touches a bit on how that works out if you go down that route.

> I also read occasionally a few guys favoring working from home

Most of us who have remained employed and don't have to be physically present in the office have been working from home all along."
1,"It’s almost like you guys are so high off of the daily show, you can’t comprehend the other sides perspective. Republicans want to lower taxes. There is way too much of the stuff you list and more going on. This has been a fundamental platform of the party since Moses split the Red Sea. “Hurr durr that’s not how taxes work.” No one is arguing how money leaves my paycheck, it’s that too much of it."
1,Look up LBJ’s war on poverty we’ve been trying at it for going on 50 years now but the poverty rate has barely changed so giving people welfare doesn’t seem to be the answer
1,"That is hopelessly optimistic. And almost immediately debunked by the current labor shortage. You remove the fear of eviction and supplement their income than nobody works. Because social welfare temporarily eclipsed what they could make by actually working. The greater the social welfare received by all the more people will be affected. If given the option most would rather settle than work for additional benefits. 

The real kicker is the less people work the more expensive basic goods would become. Since they need to encourage people to work who otherwise don't need too. The new cost of living would require an increase in social welfare provided creating a cycle until provider just gives up. The only solution here would be to mandate people work or directly assign them which kind of defeats the purpose of your above scenario."
1,Or what the tipping point is for other people to be so angry and disincentivized that they stop working. Which is a separate problem than the straight math of it.
1,"> If i understand you correctly, the problem with 1. seem more of a social issue than economic issue.

No, its economic.  The amount Yang was talking about was $1000 per month, and Yang was talking about getting people off welfare by moving them to UBI.  Very few people can live off $12,000 per year, so they'd still need to have another source of income.  Nobody would voluntarily switch from welfare to UBI - they make far more on welfare - and if forced, they would riot.  So we're talking about UBI *in addition to* welfare.

> And with 2. has it been calculated before?

328 million people times $1000 per month is $4 trillion per year - which just happens to be about the same as our total Federal revenues.  It would leave nothing left to pay for the rest of government.  Even getting rid of welfare would just reduce the amount of programs you can't pay for.

> is it really doomed? Why not give it a try?

It is really doomed.  It has been tried, and the effects were exactly what conservatives warned about.  If the amount was high enough to live on, not only was it even less affordable, people simply stopped working."
1,"Trillions spent on section 8 housing, on programs to make education cheaper. 

At some point the individual have to take responsibility or their own life.  

I believe in helping but you cannot help a person that doesn’t want to do anything. 

You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make them drink.

This is something I said early on.  If I'm a hiring manager and someone comes in looking for a job who last worked in February 2020, they had better have an explanation other than ""Unemployment paid more than working"" for why, or I won't touch them with a 10 foot pole."

There was *never* going to be a clean pull out no matter who was in office. Period.

1,Trump el Aguila de Libertad de los Estados Unidos de América Vs la Corporación comunista Globalista .... Dios Bendiga a al presidente TRUMP
1,President Trump is the last legitimate President America will ever have if he is not reinstated!  Miss Trumps leadership!🇺🇸❤️🤦‍♀️
1,"Round up the rest of them n allow Trump carry on with the job.
No brainer!"
1,"So much we know, what can we do?  So missing  President Trump."
1,"Buffett. Mr. Feinstein, Richard Blum. Rich are buying “farms”. Pelosi and Vinyard. My town was given a high number for affordable housing. Last minute, they more than doubled it. Once a beautiful community. In the 60s, my hometown gave permission for block after block of apartments. Huge complexes. A local man warned that once the properties aged, they would be detrimental. Yep!"
1,"Oops, the pro Trump superpac and their recall failed and now Republicans want to do what they do best , CRY!!!

California is great . The failed states are the super spreader states of Florida and Texas and their failed leadership."
1,This is the new Democratic party. Turn your back on our allies and help our enemies.
1,Just stop government assistance to people who is caught selling food stamps or have people living in the house that's not on the section 8 lease and we would have plenty of money that's where the most abuse happens
0,"They can pay it themselves we can used the 3 billions to help people in America

Average salary in Israel rises another 5.5% they not need pay"
0,"Healthcare in Israel is universal and participation in a medical insurance plan is compulsory. All Israeli residents are entitled to basic health care as a fundamental right
We don’t have that in USA we have to pay it or die"
0,"Why don't the chosen ones pay for their own missiles? Why is it a moral imperative that I write a check every April 15 so our rich people can give it to their rich people so they can use it to buy missiles to shoot at poor people?
Seems like the moral outrage is exactly backwards."
0,"Israel can pay for their own defense. They can afford to give their citizens Universal Healthcare and pay for their college educations. We can't do that for our own citizens, but we can give money to Israel? BS."
1,"This is a blatant attempt to put Israeli citizens in harms way by reducing their protection from the rockets fired from outside their borders... The ""Squad"" would like nothing better than to see Jews killed!!"
0,"I thought is was America first right-wingers, except when Dems actually live up to it and take action huh🤦🏾‍♂️. Let Israel not have universal healthcare and free college like america and maybe they can pay for their own defense...js"
0,i think the question is why does the US fund this rather than the Israeli government?
1,just gave the Taliban billions of military gear and these progressives were totally silent. but no support for a defense tool for Israel????
1,Why should we give money to other countries. No one helps the USA
1,Because most of the Billionaires are Democrats!
1,Now are you donating all your money 💴 because you have taxed me to death 💀
1,"And Republicans won’t ever let Democrats win Georgia again, or any state in the south. 

Or any state they can possibly stop Democrats from winning."
1,"There's a number of petroleum based products that have no association with combustion nor greenhouse gasses, so despite what some progressives may think, old fossils do have value."
1,"I teach history, I don't teach critical race theory. CRT is not history, CRT comes from the study of law. A good history teacher shares what happened and teaches students how to think critically about what happened. 

The problem we have here is ignorant people trying to change the way we teach history and using CRT as the boogeyman to try to make that happen. They are fascists and like all good fascists, they see the schools as propaganda machines, not educational institutions. So they use scary words to make their followers believe something is wrong and shouldn't be taught. 

I, and all of my co-workers, are ready to be the test case for anyone who wants to challenge what we teach in our classrooms."
1,"Yet, Democrats show no willingness to be bold when in power.

Republicans take their minority to execute their vision, enact whatever they can…hold up nominations. Yet, little shits like Manchin bitch and moan about bipartisanship. Wake up you senile POS, bipartisanship only exists when Democrats are in power"
1,"Criticizing Biden is a bad thing? How is that something to be mad about? He's made mistakes in the past, he's not perfect, I don't agree with all his positions. 

And just so you know, he was criticized for it back then."
1,"Republicans are usually opposed to unchecked and illegal immigration, expecting some level of assimilation or cultural affinity before being allowed to enter the country.

Statistics like these vindicate those positions, since it is often native citizens suffering at the hands of these criminals, and by extension, their government's policy."
1,"Ok, so to be clear, I gave you an opportunity to defend your statement that this table is false. And you essentially refuse to take it, saying you don't care to research the topic and based on your edit only spoke up in defiance of the information because you want to mirror republican behavior.

But like I said, and proved, above. When we disagree we often have evidence to back it up. We don't disagree because the information provided hurt our feelings.

Also you say stats can be and are manipulated. I 100% agree with you. I have an example.

The other day I saw a news clip that said, ""vaccinated people have a 99.999% survival rate. Unvaccinated people are 25 times more likely to die"" that sounds drastic! 99.999% survival rate vs 25 times more likely to die... Let's do that math.

100 - 99.999 = 0.001 (chance of death while vaccinated)

0.001 x 25 = 0.025 (25 times more likely to die while unvaccinated)

100 - 0.025 = 99.975% chance of survival for unvaccinated people.

Yet people are losing careers over vaccine mandates... For a vaccine that doesn't prevent you from contracting or transmitting. It doesn't even prevent you from dying. For an experimental technology (mRNA) that has never gone past lab trials before this year so there is ZERO long term effect studies.

See when republicans reject things, we typically have logic and facts to justify our stance."
1,"Who is upvoting the original post? It's a troll post. He simply asked for accountability for the extremely fucked up withdrawal of Americans from Afganistan. Biden didn't even notify NATO of our withdrawal plans. 13 Dead marines. $84 billion of military equipment,  weapons, and vehicles given to terrorists. Taliban going door to door executing Americans and Afgans that helped us. Biden couldn't have fucked it up much worse if he tried."
1,"He won't be running against Biden.  Everyone knows Biden is unfit, he will not be permitted to run in 2024 by whoever gives him his list of people to call on."
1,At this point a 3rd grader should be able to win against Biden in 2024. They would most certainly do a better job.
1,"Wow, that is actually really sad. ""Settle for Biden"" being a slogan, official or not, is almost terrifying. ""Settle for this guy! We don't like him either, but he's better than the OTHER guy!""

Sheesh, even THEY knew Biden wasn't the best."
1,Cause there is no pandemic to control
1,"The young turks are missing Mr. elders point all together. Intentionally. Mr. Elder is pointing out the absurdities one encounters when going down the rabbit hole of reparations.

Elder opened my eyes on the matter. Made me contemplate some important questions and consider things I had not considered. 

Would Rachel dolezal get reparations? Would Oprah Winfrey? Obama? Kamala Harris? When today there are FAR more poverty stricken white people in America than any other people. Do all black people get reparations even though many NEVER had relatives who were enslaved? What about those black people whose families were actually slave OWNERS? There were many. Who pays these reparations? All white people? All citizens whether they had anything to do with the slave trade or not? Republican families who sacrificed their own flesh and blood to liberate the slaves and end the infamous traffic? People whose families never even lived in the country until maybe 100 years after the infamous traffic of slavery had ended? They owe, too? The South was home to 250,000 free blacks. Do their descendants get reparations, too? There were ~4000 black slave owners owning more than 20,000 slaves. How does that figure into “Reparations”? Since the country’s founding 306,000 slaves were brought here, but since slavery ended more than 2,000,000 black Africans have come here by choice... another 1,000,000 Black Americans came here by choice and by way of the Caribbean. how does THAT figure into reparations?

Because of Larry elder it now seems to me that the only proper way to handle the inequities of the past is to make sure that our laws are just TODAY. That they’re applied equally to every citizen. To continue to provide access to opportunity WITHOUT favoring or handicapping ANY racial group. I think that’s the best we’ve got."

Thank you for your efforts, AOC all the way!"

I bless the path you are on, and admire your perseverance in the face of assault. Be safe. Your life is too precious."
0,"I was so worried about how you would handle this. Need to clarify that you have no real responsibility to be vocal about business that’s not your own however as a political (really in career only…. And I mean that as a compliment) you have been and frequently do voice yourself opinions…. A lot, if not all, are not lunacy and I agree with.

0,"I'm still waiting for the media and democrats to pressure Congressman Matt Gaetz to do the same and also legally force Trump's hand to submit his DNA in a possible rape case.

How far should rules go? Desert Sun Gannett Article
--- --- ---
I commend the Palm Springs City Council for going further than almost every other city, even the most progressive, in enacting both a vaccine and a mask mandate. Even San Francisco and New York have only mandated one or the other.

The city should now mandate medical grade masks, since cloth masks are virtually useless. In fact, they should unilaterally re-enact Newsom’s old color coded system, and require strict capacity limitations and masking outdoors. We need at least a 50% capacity restriction, plus a mask mandate, plus a vaccine mandate to control the virus now. And leave more restrictions options on the table if people just won’t behave.

The fact that some would actually agree with what I just wrote is terrifying.

Gene Gambale, Indio"
0,"I agree.
‘Reasonable people can disagree about when a zygote becomes a ""human life"" - that's a philosophical question. However, regardless of whether or not one believes a fetus is ethically equivalent to an adult, it doesn't obligate a mother to sacrifice her body autonomy for another, innocent or not.

Body autonomy is a critical component of the right to privacy protected by the Constitution, as decided in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), McFall v. Shimp (1978), and of course Roe v. Wade (1973). Consider a scenario where you are a perfect bone marrow match for a child with severe aplastic anemia; no other person on earth is a close enough match to save the child's life, and the child will certainly die without a bone marrow transplant from you. If you decided that you did not want to donate your marrow to save the child, for whatever reason, the state cannot demand the use of any part of your body for something to which you do not consent. It doesn't matter if the procedure required to complete the donation is trivial, or if the rationale for refusing is flimsy and arbitrary, or if the procedure is the only hope the child has to survive, or if the child is a genius or a saint or anything else - the decision to donate must be voluntary to be constitutional.
This right is even extended to a person's body after they die; if they did not voluntarily commit to donate their organs while alive, their organs cannot be harvested after death, regardless of how useless those organs are to the deceased or many lives they would save. That's the law.

Use of a woman's uterus to save a life is no different from use of her bone marrow to save a life - it must be offered voluntarily. By all means, profess your belief that providing one's uterus to save the child is morally just, and refusing is morally wrong. That is a defensible philosophical position, regardless of who agrees and who disagrees. But legally, it must be the woman's choice to carry out the pregnancy. She may choose to carry the baby to term. She may choose not to. Either decision could be made for all the right reasons, all the wrong reasons, or anything in between. But it must be her choice, and protecting the right of body autonomy means the law is on her side. Supporting that precedent is what being pro-choice means.’” ~ from a friend"

0,"Also if they do somehow squeak out a win in the recall, statewide it puts them at a disadvantage in ‘22 because it means they will have a record they will have to defend. Imagine Larry elder trying to defend his record next year, which would undoubtedly be super unpopular. He’d lose re-election for sure. However, if he wins this recall, it will be good for the GOP nationally because they can push propaganda saying how even “crazy commiefornia” was fed up with democrats and chose a Republican governor (despite the fact that he can win the recall election without a majority of the state’s votes). They will use this as evidence to push the party further right and it will help them fundraise in other states, the logic being that if democrats are even too crazy for California, then they’re clearly too crazy for states like Missouri or Ohio. We really can’t let that happen. We’ve got to prove to middle America that our candidates are far more reasonable and pragmatic and that the extremists are the republicans"
0,"Their mothers must be so proud of her children passing this law. Until a grandchild becomes pregnant at 14. The pro life party has proven once again that the only life that matters is the one that can’t breathe. If you are on EBT benefits, need unemployment insurance, can’t afford insurance or you get sick enough with covid to die they just don’t care. Of course, they’ll lie and tell Texans under 21 that all birth control fails and you should save yourself for marriage. We’ve seen how well that’s working. The simplest thing to do to prevent abortion is to provide free long acting birth control to every woman who wants it. Or to give the guy a vasectomy. Let’s face it, he can infect more women with pregnancy than one woman can. Worked with a pos one time who was bragging because he had three women pregnant at the same time and on was either twins or triplets. All of whom would be raised on welfare."

0,"I'd agree with you but for the fact that so many of our people are still unvaccinated and chances of new variants developing are high. 

So boosters first for us since studies are showing that it really boosts our protections. Then by all means protect the world because unless everyone is vaccinated, we're not safe. It can spread again as it did the first time."

0,"How does that alleviate the burden of carrying a rapist's child?  How does that (to put it bluntly) undestroy their body?  How does that prevent the hospital bill, or the trauma of childbirth?  How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria?  How does that make it less of an economic burden to take an unwanted child and foist them into a poorly organized and definitely underfunded foster system (it's Texas, in case you think they care) that _mostly_ results in molestation, prostitution and abuse?  How does that not further the burden of guilt placed on someone who never wanted that child to begin with?

Utterly and completely destroying a good section of the work force, emotionally, physically, financially and in all ways permanently, (unless they have a neuralizer, panacea or a winning lottery ticket respectively) is not good for the economy.

And that's just considering the unlucky and unwilling mother.  What of her coworkers, or her significant other?  They have to pick up the hours or those companies simply do without, resulting in lost revenue, quality, and supply.  Have you ever worked a 12 hour double shift, or an 8 hour triple shift?  Because I fucking have, and I wasn't even involved.  Now you have to deal with burn out and turn over from an entirely unrelated set of people, time into training and damaged product or shoddy services resulting in slow-down FOR 9 MONTHS.  And that's if they can come back at all!  The U.S. at large basically doesn't even have a support system for pregnant people if you compare it to other first world nations.

There is no ""what if we try x."". This is a bad law designed to make broken homes that a political base can scapegoat and slavewage 16 years down the line.  It is designed to be economically expensive because that's _the whole point._"

0,"The thing is, if ""pro-life"" conservatives truly wanted fewer abortions, they would 100% support better sex education in schools and easier (or free) access to contraceptives, because those are the only two reliable methods of reducing the number of abortions. 

They go on and on about ""saving the life of the child"", but what about the quality of life for that child? Are Texas voters going to improve their foster care system? Will they support giving financial aid to mothers who can't afford the children that they never wanted? I don't hear any mention from them about what they are willing to do to support these unwanted children. 

Why are they silent about helping these unwanted children? Because they don't really care about the children. They only care about punishing women for being sexually active. They want women to suffer because those women aren't conforming to their conservative ideals."
0,"Pro-Life Religious Conservatives also love advocating for people who are on life support but will otherwise not get better. People who cannot advocate for themselves e.g. the braindead or the unborn are a great campaigning point for the conservative right because it requires no resources and allows them to both scare people and make people angry at the perceived moral backwardness of progressives. See this podcast about Terry Schiavo for a great example

0,"This is of course correct. They don’t want abortions to go down, they want women to stop having sex (except with them of course). It isn’t about abortion, it’s about sex and who they think should and shouldn’t be having it."
0,"Its 100% about judgment and control. If you allow free access to contraceptives and sex ed, you are condoning sinners. To them, its a sin trade- sex or abortion."
0,"Everything that the religious right supports makes sense in the context of punishing women for sex and does not make sense in the context of preventing abortions: abstinence only education, prohibitions on birth control and lack of government support for families. At some point in time we have to stop giving abusers the benefit of their word."
0,That was one very public case. Brain dead people get taken off life support every day and not a peep from the right. They also have no issue with taking a human life if they feel the human doesn’t deserve to live(executions).

0,I can't help noticing how with all the disastrous weather events lately with people losing everything they own and being put out on the street in the middle of a pandemic that the Evangelicals and their pet politicians who have no ability or interest to perform governing to aid or assist people continue to lie and actively hurt people instead- it's like I never knew before that such morally bankrupt people existed in this country before.

You're going to pay for other people. That's how government works, that's literally how ALL of taxes work. Do you think you're suddenly exempt from taxes because you have ethical issues with the military or because you don't believe in social programs? That's not how any of this works.

And please do not bring up Moses in a conversation about taxes. If you truly are a child of God, show some humility. Let me remind you of Matthew 25:41.

There is no intention of the republicans agreeing to anything for the present, they are looking at the future. You can see that in what Trump is doing by supporting all these people in state positions dealing with elections, if the the elections in the future is very close. Your dealing with some very nasty, corrupt individuals, that will stop at nothing, to cheat to win. An example is the last Supreme Court judge that shows how evil they are. Again they have cheated in the past when they didn't have the votes and changed it to 50 votes to win. You never trust Moscow Mitch McConnell and you should know that by now. You want to do something positive, start getting the people in the Republican Party with all the criminal activity they have done in the last plus decade. Get them removed from office and put in prison if possible. There supporters don't care how corrupt Trump and the Republicans are. The more corrupt they are the better they like it. You saw who supports them and the type of people they are. It's going to be interesting how hard the punishment will be for the people that were arrested for the insurrection, who was involved in the planning, and weapons that were used to murder the people that lost their life and the type of injuries that caused their wounds.

0,"Age should also be measured starting at conception, then. Birthdays are now Conception Days. All human rights apply at six weeks of age. Men who beat their wives or otherwise induce miscarriage will be persecuted for first degree manslaughter in addition to domestic violence charges. Half of all medical costs paid by the father begins at six weeks. They will need to be added to health care coverage plans as well. No need for birth certificates there will now be Conception Identification with only a number until other information is obtained. Can a person legally not have a name? If not- you must be named as soon as conception is confirmed. As a zygote is now *life* a new *possible life* will likely be recognized. As such, male masturbation will be closely monitored and prohibited as it does not occur without external stimulation. Sex without procreative intent will be discouraged and you can bet birth control will be next to go. Any age restricted right will be measured from conception, obviously. The definition of life will need revision. Basic science and the seven characteristics of life no longer apply. So many nonliving things just became living. I’m not sure about this one but if the pregnancy or childbirth kills the mother doesn’t that make the person responsible the fetus? How would that work? Anyways- point is this whole idea is a stupid front for punishing and controlling women. You can bet that the rich will be getting abortions for their wives and the other poor women they knock up. Look- if I get raped and pregnant I’m gonna get put in prison for the abortion anyway so might as well shoot the rapist in the face just sayin."

0,"Sorry, but this data is completely made up.  Please check the government sites for Sweden and Israel for factual data.  Also, no country is currently on their 3rd shot of vaccine in other than critical care deployments.   This is just designed to rile people up and try to prove a point that isn’t supported by either measured fact or by critical reasoning.  Vaccines work.  Masks work.  Social distancing works.  The USA proved this was effective under both Trump and Biden.  Now we’re suffering again thanks to people spreading these lies.  Viruses mutate.  That’s why we get a different flu vaccine every year.  Covid mutated in the the more aggressive and dangerous Delta variant.  Now people with no defenses, folks who refuse to get vaccinated, are being hit hard.  This sucks and is completely avoidable.  How do I know this.  I’ve got two doctors in my family, both working ICUs.  Both watching people suffer and die.  Direct observation of fact.  Please get vaccinated and end this.

Edit:  As I noted in a follow up comment below, I was looking at the unvaccinated occurrence of infection, not the overall country rate.  But this also bought up the key difference in vaccination between Sweden and Israel.  Sweden is far more vaccinated than Israel is.  Hence lower  Hence relaxation of mask and social distancing.  Vaccinate and wear masks to help protect the unvaccinated."

Why not shine lights on outstanding overachievers that happen to be minorities?!? Why not teach the children there are exceptional individuals in every race, not just White!!! Why not explain what Really happened in History!!! Racism fuels hate! That’s it!!! There is no other purpose or productive use for it!! I’m just appalled but not sleep 😴. Very woke!!

1,I applaud them all standing up for Conservative values and their children !! PATRIOTS for sure 💯💖🇱🇷🙏🇱🇷 save the children from that Left Lunacy !!
1,It doesn't seem like a debate to me. It seems like liberals forcing CRT onto children that the vast majority of America does not want.
1,It's authoritarian maxism vs freedom

1,"At the same time why not educate the ppl not to flee and obey the officers orders, in most cases at the max you would be arrested, warned or cited for wrong doing. But if you have a warrant ofcourse they arrest you. Obeying officers orders was one of things I was taught by my seniors when I arrived into US into 2006. Hope the young and vulnerable learn a lesson in addition to better training and rules for the officers to bring a positive change in the society. Bashing each other and politicizing the issue will only make mattes worse. Side note that kid at 20 should be in college not parenting a 2yr old boy, thats a broader problem this cntry has to address."
1,"...says the socialist who wants to increase state violence, authority, and spending."
1,"You mean taxing more. Very noble intention, but how we solve there is where the problem lies. You Leftists make policies based on emotions instead of coming with rational ones. America has been sending money abroad, lots of them, we can instead use them to help our seniors and to fund child care. We could use capitalism instead of socialism to fund these important expenditures. Imposing more taxes just compels businesses like Nike to outsource jobs to China."
1,"Idk ask China and India about saving the planet while China builds coal facilities in record numbers?

1,Ahh shut up you communist bum.
1,Flat tax everybody pays 15%
1,So this administration increases food stamps payouts 25% and yet social security not even 3%. So if you've worked all your life and played by the rules the Democrats show their appreciation by throwing you crumbs as a social security recipient but if you come here from another country or you going food stamps it seems like you priorities are misconstrued
1,How much is too much when you communists want to tax a working persons paycheck 🖕🏼
1,"First non essential spending has to, pampering your voters (they shouldn’t need the rich to change their diapers for a lifetime) funding murder of children, allowing crime, illegal immigration (maybe one day your voters will have to share) of course battling mother nature by yourself will accomplish nothing but other nations laughing at us as they save. The insanity goes on and on."

After he cancelled the Keystone Pipeline, he then lifted all sanctions on the Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline that runs from Russia to Germany. They will soon be able to sell their excess gas to Europe at a time when gas prices have increased 250%.
During the Trump administration,
we achieved energy independence and we were selling the surplus overseas. Joe Biden has drug us back to the dependency on foreign oil, where we buy oil from countries that hate us. Gasoline prices in the United States have increased by about 50%."

1,That cost is due to bad regulations that were passed by you and Joe the past 40 years.

But we only have 25 people in hospital and 5 in ICU & no deaths at all this year - that is state wide total - not per day. But the entire state of over 5 million is in lockdown, curfew 9pm-5am, can only travel 5km from home, allowed outside for only 1 hour per day to excercise, all businesses except for essential services are closed-most are now backrupt, schools are still closed. This is our 6th lockdown - we have had more than 200 days in lockdown and no school attendance for 200 days. The mental health in the school aged children is our new pandemic but Victorian government will not address it - or even discuss it at their daily press conference. Violent protests are not the answer - but we are not surprised that it is sadly coming to this.😢"

1,"What's funny to me is that the people that are on board with the masks, shot, and stay at home orders REALLY believe that it will end. That it's only temporary. They never notice the gov never speaks of an end. Just more and more restrictions. It's horrifying to think people are this blind."
1,Radical left will try to get every one of our rights eliminated.
1,"After so long of being told to stay home, don’t talk or interact with anyone and mandatory lockdowns the people will get tired of it! The people will raise up against their “leaders” and we will see countries succumb to revolutions much like the French Revolution!

1,"When is Pelosi being impeached? Oh that's right, she's a Democrat. They are protected by hypocrisy."
1,"Yes it is every bit as bad in Melbourne Australia as it appears!
200 plus days of hard lockdown plus a similar amount under heavy restrictions such as not being allowed to have any visitors, work, travel more than 5kms,( 3 miles), and curfew from 9pm to 5am.
We are under the control of an insane dictator obsessed with eradication of the virus while nuking everything!
Kids and people are topping themselves or attempting to, and going around the bend.
Fine for going to the protest or disobeying rules is $5000 dollars!!
The mainstream media are pushing the same propaganda as the Andrews government has inflicted on us.
Lockdowns mightn't even end after we hit 80% vaccinated, now they're pushing for kids to be included!
I Weep for my children's future, democracy Worldwide has never been more in peril! 😕"
1,"Australia is a perfect example of why Americans should be so grateful of the 2nd amendment and do everything you can to protect it!
I don’t believe Australia’s government would be doing what they’re doing if they had a nation full of arm citizens."
1,"I am from a Suburb in Sydney, NSW. Every morning at 11am all the MSM televise our Premier, Gladys Berajiglian ranting and raving about this Delta virus and the dangers of it. We went into lockdown on 26 June 2021 and as of Monday 23rd August, she placed a curfew, no one allowed out of their home between 9pm -5am. when this Delta outbreak began, she said 1,000sands are going to get the virus and 1,000sands are going to die. So far 130 have passed away, and I would be confident to say 100 died of old age and the rest died of other illnesses other than Delta. They even listed a 15yr old boy as a Covid death who was in Hospital for menningacoccal.
It is absolute Tyranny in the state of NSW. We are not even allowed to protest, the Government has given the Police force all powers to make sure of that.

They have scared the population so much that 6,000,000 have had at least 1 dose of the vaccine.

We are living in a nightmare in ""The Lucky Country."
1,"I'm in Melbourne I haven't heard any reports about the dog shooting ,we're not under marshal law, the ADF is assisting the police in NSW with checking on people who should be isolating as far as know. We are under a curfew 9pm to 5am,and we need permits to work, and that's if your an essential worker, our lockdown rules are pretty harsh, I can't visit my daughters, can only travel over 5kms for work, not pleasure. No standard retail is open, only essential shopping centres, and Saturdays protest came out of pure frustration, people are tired of being locked away, it's a shame it came to that, but people are on edge. If we do get to 80% vaccination, Queensland and Western Australia have said they may not open their boarders to other states ,because they won't 0 covid, so yep we're doing it hard down under. 🇦🇺🇦🇺"
1,Australia is a perfect example of what happens to an UNARMED population....
1,No one can trust their government and do not give up Any constitutional rights or rights to protect yourself
1,Thanks Tucker Carlson Tonight It's true here in Melbourne. Lockup 6.0 Only allowed out for 5 reasons. Get caught too far from home they fine ya. Curfew. 5km limit. Permits for everything. Kids still learning online. Mental health issues growing. Vacant shops growing. Yet people keep voting the socialists back in.

1,This was seriously a scary segment. The hypocrisy from Nancy Pelosi is nothing new. She’s a disgrace. But the drama going on in Australia is unbelievable. I’m sure none of them are reporting any deaths from cancer or the flu or heart attacks. Over a year later…. And the WORLD still has zero clue.

1,"This is the end result of gun confiscation, what was shown going on in Australia is what happens to a docile unarmed populace. The only reason the powers that be here in the US cannot do what the Aussie's are doing is because of our 2nd Amendment and 500+ million weapons in civilian hands. Once push came to shove as seen with the authoritarianis
m in Australia, American's would fight back but we would not comply with this kind of brutality on our streets from the government. Of course this is just my opinion on what i just saw."

1,I bet they wish they wouldn't have gave up their firearms now. America would be just like this if we didn't have a 2nd Amendment
1,There is evidence that it also spreads via shedding or fecal matter… so when they finally accept that bit of scientific data maybe they will realize that all the lockdowns and isolating people in groups trapped in their own domiciles was not the smartest idea. The people in charge are going about this all wrong.
1,"It's so very sad for the real people of the United States of America, to have to continue to put up with the Biden administration what a load of rubbish the Biden administration has TURNED out to be.

God bless you all."

It’s now home to the socialist thugs running roughshod over the people. You’re right about one thing; Victorian, Queensland and Western Australian voters have recently voted them back in.

It’s unbelievable and, IF I could afford it, and IF I could leave (yes, locked in, locked up and locked down), I’d emigrate."
1,"What about the next mandate? Do you really believe, after seeing this and Obamas birthday party, that these people are getting the vaccine? Or is it all for show so the masses are mandated? Vaccine is not mandated for the White House or Phizer employees."
1,People are ignoring reports like this and letting their fellow citizens be targeted and made to be criminals. Covid mandates and lockdowns are creating a reward system. Comply and we give you back your freedoms. Till they stop doing that too.
1,"Im in Queensland, Australia.
Certain States have different rules, Victoria is the most totalitarian, New south wales is a bit better, but stil mandating masks and forced vaccinations, but the other 4 states and 2 territories aren't in lock down.
There may be a 3 day lock down here and there if there are 30 ish cases, but it depends on how much of a Dictator the state health officer is"
1,Who’s going to print the T-shirt’s “I’m a dangerous slacker cause a won’t wear a mask so shoot me” cause I will wear one. Totally not tasteful but the whole thing is beyond absurd and most Americans are beyond fed up and that also speaking up in defense also of this heinous crime too. The world has gone insane and it’s time to stand up!
1,Shocking but so happy Tucker is speaking out!!! I hope ALL Americans watch this!!!
1,"I have great respect Tucker, and by no means agree with mask mandate. But they are at a table, outside, fixing to eat. Now how do you eat a 30k meal with a mask on. Even Republicans take them off to eat.
This is getting attention for silly reasons."
1,It's time we stand strong against this bs! They cannot jail all of us o r get money from the poor? They cannot keep up with rules? Rules are made to be bent and laws are made to be broken as far as this ridiculous mandate goes
1,This is not some communist country -- this is AUSTRALIA! We canNOT let this happen here!
1,Who is giving these leaders these rules. They are obviously getting there rules from some higher authority and it definitely not the WHO it’s something else. This is a takeover of the world and people need to put politics aside and stand up against this tyranny!!!!
1,Just like Obama's party they all know this is nonsense. They aren't saying so but they're demonstrating it very clearly all of them. They only put on masks for the TV camera.
1,"Tucker Carlson Tonight, you’re not completely correct in your Australian report. Not all of Australia is under Marshall law, just New South Wales and I think Victoria. Queensland is at this point still reasonably free, but it won’t take much for us to go under either. Interstate travel is near impossible though."
1,The Delta variant is completely undetectable. There is no PCR test or rapid test that can pick up on the Delta variant. The only thing they can believe is that fear is going to drive people to believe that this is a powerful virus. The Delta variant is a weak mutation
1,"That's what happens when Citizens give up their arms, they become subjects and serfs."
1,Hey Tucker I love your work man and your courage . Am in NZ and yes our esteemed leader it seems was trained by the best tyrants .
1,"This is the Democratic Party. Dangerous and hypocritical. Preaching we must all wear face diapers, while they go unmasked. People are hopefully waking up to the insanity!"
1,Good for thee but not for me. They are only mandating masks to turn us against each other. This happened to me yesterday at the Vet office where I was viscously verbally attacked by a woman and told to put on a mask. I was unprepared for this attack as everyplace is really left to your own discretion in our city right now. The only thing I could muster was I don’t do masks. She sat on the other side of the room videoing me and the whole waiting room and will probably put it on social-media. -I really don't care. Picking on a 100 pound grandma wearing a huge back brace from my recent surgery is how you’ll recognize me. I work on my health everyday of my life as I have autoimmune and back issues. I have felt great for the past 8 years and even more since this recent surgery. She needs to take a look in the mirror at what appeared to me to be a very overweight unhealthy individual and worry about herself. PS I still have the antibodies from Covid that I got while in the Holocaust museum filled with Chinese students here on their winter break before any of us had even heard of it. I was very ill for 10 days. PS- I LIVED!
1,"Tucker, our leader (the lady with the teeth🤣)
Just so happens she was the elected President of 'The International Union of Socialist Youth'
You can see her political beliefs have not changed.
We are locked down with under 30 deaths to covid total. 🤦"
1,Australians let them take their guns a long time ago. Now they have no way to resist.
1,"Covid-19 spike I'm Fl. Hmmm, could it be nc hundred s of illegal s were transport we there and was told the vaccine is OPTIONAL?!"
1,George Travancoor that’s why our governor relaxed rules on owning a gun. I’ll be ready for anyone that tries to force a mask or a shot on or in me.
1,"Australia is now in the grip of dictators, my once proud free democratic country, is no more. The next step will be a license to breath."
1,It does not become any clearer than seeing it with your own eyes . The elite and power hungry are slowly sacrificing the people of this country. The second amendment was put into place to fight tyranny and tyranny we are victims of until we decide to stop playing this game.
1,"That’s what happens when you freely give up your guns. Sadly, this is only the beginning in Australia"
1,When we gonna stand up and just say no????? I don’t wear one even when asked I got the Johnson shot because my wife asked me to because of her job she takes care of the elderly as an administrator at a retirement home. But the people telling us we have to wear one a mask because it’s so deadly but don’t even believe it’s that deadly them selves
1,People can’t turn their heads anymore thinking nothing can happen here! It’s happening and Nancy is leadings it. She’s crazy.
1,They gave up their guns and that's what happens!
1,It's not about a virus...if it was the borders would be closed. It's about control at this point...
1,I am Australian I can see the lunacy in this and millions of Australians do but we are powerless our government has also been hijacked by leftist communist ratbags and our police became the Gestapo overnight unbelievable
1,Isn't that indicative of the fact that something is going on. And you can bet that the folks in power had protection before this virus was released.
1,The government stole Australians’ guns for a reason.
1,"Don't post this just on social sides post this on her page LoL.. if this would be a pandemic and be so dangerous and all this drama this witches (B) saying it is, there are the ones who would be in a bunker .. this is a control game and why is no one shows her or who ever get cut this pictures and late them explain it to us WTF THEY THINK THEY DOING .. EXPLAIN THIS where is the Covid .. so much BS makes my head spin.. and ppl believe all this covid crap"
1,But the first thing the government did in Australia is take their guns. Now they have no power to resist.
1,"Im from Melbourne and i can confirm that this is all true, leaving your house will get you a $5000 fine but because people arnt paying the fine the government now wants to seize property to make up for it, its insane"
1,"Terry Leef Abood you might like this. What's good for the goose isn't necessarily good for the gander. Really ticks me off seeing Pelosi and the rest trying to control my life. ""We the people"" are forgotten and in some ways dying needlessly to further their agenda."
1,the democrats are going to try and push this until the vote in 2022 mail in vote is the only way to win
1,"America does not leave Americans behind Nor do we play nice guy with the enemy.
This is a posture of weakness. We will do what ever it takes . Stand Up Americans Wake Up
What this Administration is doing is Outrageous!!! I'm asking for the President and the administration to Resign. Get out of the way!!! If they don't do what it takes to remove them immediately Congress Republicans,Dem
ocrats & Independents Do your job !!! The Military can take care of this Listen to the Veterans who fought there.
God Bless Our Military and Veterans
2 Chronicles 7:14"
1,It gives me the message that it's having trouble playing this video. This is not the first conservative video I have not been able to view on Facebook today. I think they are censoring again.
1,It’s insane my siblings live in Sweden and are in the medical field they stated they did not have tons off deaths and did not wear masks so again insanity
1,"The hypocrisy has turned into madness, thanks to the left. As usual there are no rules or laws that apply to the ruling class."
1,Unbelievable that they still have Dr. Fauci on TV and people are again hanging on to every word he says. God help us all! Only God can save us now. Keep praying everyone! Evil will not Prevail!!
1,Australia has gone full blown communist.
1,"Never, ever give up your guns / weapons."
1,"South Australian here, yea the states under labor control (the leftards or democrats) who have imposed the most ridiculous lock downs and rules ironically have the worst daily case numbers in our country.. im in south Australia, and we are going to work, myself in civil construction, and dont have to mask up unless being inside a shop or the likes.. its the left wing ideology thats proven to be no help, but scare and anger the people.."
1,"Thank you Tucker for reporting what is happening in NZ & Australia, you are a brave man, may God bless you and keep you always"
1,Only reason the population of Australia put up with a shutdown is Australian government took all the firearms. That is why we need to fight this government and keep them from taking away the second amendment.
1,"Have you noticed, if you watch this on utube , it is edited! Why? The pictures are filled in with Donald Trump in the corner, not the videos/ picture of What Tucker is talking about like the Pelosi gathering without masks. Why edited?"
1,We're being conditioned to accept rules for the surfs but not for the elites. That's why they keep throwing it in our faces.
1,"Hypocrisy at its finest! they DEMAND of us, doesn’t apply to them! The thinking of leaving our American boarders WIDE OPEN is an open invitation to thousands more Covid in Texas and elsewhere! Sam Gonzales Lydia Gonzales De Vasquez what are your thoughts? Lisa Cavazos Darras Lisa Daniels Feldman"
1,I think we’re all in denial this is communism. We all need to wake up
1,"FACT Check Tucker Carlson Tonight, “No one is Australia is laughing at this, no one in Australia is standing back far enough and seeing the lunacy on display” is incorrect!!! It is a minority but there are many of us who are not happy at all and seeing how crazy Australia has gone! The country of freedom has disappeared and now it’s communist Australia 🇦🇺 Very sad☹️ 😢"
1,It's because they can't have guns for defense.
1,"Peslosi drops her participles. 😬 😊 On that basis alone she can never be presidential material. Ironically enough, I really do mean this. It only takes a modicum of education. Otherwise one speaks like a fool. 😂😂😂"
1,yes it is pretty bad in Australia at the moment I live in Victoria and in the last year and a half we have been in lockdown for over 200 days prisoners in our own homes you are allowed to go to the shops Within five k’s for essential items and you are allowed to go to work if you are considered an essential worker it is pretty depressing Feels like I have wasted the last year and a half of my life gotten absolutely nowhere done nothing that is why there was protests over the weekend because a lot of us are about to snap yeah this is not the Australia I grew up in it is hard to watch it’s not right
1,"Something very evil corrupts these elite puppets thinking and it's dangerously obvious THEY ARE OWNED. Goe Hiden has been on his knees three times?? WHAT IN ""HELL"" HAS ERUPTED??? 🤬🤬🤬🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉"
1,Australians are ready for Chinese rule
1,And those who don't bring Pelosi ice-cream from her ice-cream fridge will be slaves to her forever.
1,Shame they don’t have guns. Pretty sure this would he handled very differently if they did.
1,"As someone has posted, takes more to enter a restaurant than to cross our borders.."
1,"You notice The Prime Minister isn't wearing a mask, one rule for some another rule for others."
1,Pelosi should have been required to wear a mask long before the coronavirus ever came along
1,He's another communist it's all right and that's the rest of her cohorts including Joe and Pamela Harris.
1,If the ceo of Pfizer won’t take his own vaccine what does that tell you? If the CDC does not force its employees to take the shot! No one in Biden’s admin is forced to take the shot! What the hell does that tell you????
1,And people are willing to mask our children... disgusting and evil.
1,You know I don’t want to share air with palosi either. Can she hold her breath please?
1,Biden is full of it and why people listen to him is beyond me. 1st off Florida is not full of Covid with people dying left and right. Biden just doesn't like Governor DeSantis!
1,"Rules for the masses and not for the elite!
Communism, socialism continues, look at all the examples worldwide."
1,This absolute BS must stop. Arm yourselves because it looks like we are going to need to overthrow our sadistic “leaders.”
1,"Wear masks, take the jab, keep social distance, but don't forget the next wave is on its way. Keep it up citizens you are doing well with your communism course. Mind training is hard but you wil get there."
1,First thing I notice is not one person of color at Pelosi's fund raiser. Not one. So tucker ask the Squad why is that.
1,"What's that old saying what's that old saying do as I say not as I do, what gets me so mad cuz they got all these people coming in on the southern border no mask all these people from Afghanistan no mask and yet their own people they're making mandatory mask 😷🎭"
1,"This entire Administration is acting like an Aristocracy.
I think they are forgetting what happened to the last one who tried to rule our lives. Remember King George.
If I was a Democratic hippocrate I would be very afraid.
It just took only 75,000 Taliban soldiers to run us out of Afghanistan.
What do you think half the Country could do to Washington if they continue to attempt to rule us like a Monarchy."
1,Thank you Tucker Carlson Tonight for talking about the madness in Australia 🙏 Next week our truckies are going on protest blocking highways to voice their opinion on mandatory vaxx to cross borders.
1,"Please, tell me when they are going to ""finally"" start investigating ""Nancy Pelosi, the State of California and the office of the Speaker of the House?"
1,PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBWR- MANDATES ARE NOT LAWS!! This is all about CONTROL!!!!!!
1,Nor That woman have on a mask.. Why isn't anyone challenging these people. The news media aren't 6ft and none wears a mask inside.. yet not a sound.
1,the Australians made a mistake when they trusted the government and turned over their weapons
1,"Im glad Jason Whitlock said it. Im glad someone finally said it. Its ALL satanic. Politics, entertainment, communism, LGBTQ, wokism, marxism; it all flies in the face of Christianity all the while they attack Christians of bigotry while never explaining a single instance. The Left attacks the opposition with the very thing they are doing. As soon as Jason said it, I was like THANK YOU!"
1,So why is it the self ordained elites dont wear protection at public venues as Obama & his cronies did at his 60th B-day party on Martha's vineyard recently? What do they know that we dont? Hmm? What the hell is going on? Wake up Americans!
1,PLEASE! a start going after the “do-nothing“ Republicans to draft articles of impeachment against the entire Biden administration and Nancy Pelosi. They must go
1,"Yeah, that’s why no one at the event in which Pelosi was speaking were wearing masks, except the servers."
1,Think about this she didn't like Trump so she is the one leaving our military behind she knows Trump loves them just like she undone the border knowing he was tring to fix it everything he was about she undone this is all control in all countries covid is coming around again do to all the one's that's been vaxed month's ago this is why they push the shots
1,"stionable election results!"""
1,"This is the women who fines The house of representatives
$500 for not wearing a mask."
1,Obama had a Birthday party with possibly 600 guests of the rich and famous type and nobody wore masks. Mandates don't really apply to the elite in the democrat party or to some of their RINO friends because the mask mandate is about having power and control over others. The jews were forced to wear a yellow star on their clothing when outside.
1,the question I must ask is WHY are these police enforcing this ideocracy?
1,So quick question. Based on the limited video. Does this event violate any of the mandates in place in that area?
1,now if they want to play this crap ok then what if AMERICA decides too demand this then. if any server serving my food or any one in a store we need too see there papers of any other kind of health issues . cold flu any thing they need papers showing they are either sick or just getting over or other kind of sickness they had or do have.
1,These women need testosterone. Look at the decision makers…
1,They are working on 1 world government and we just sit here and let them

1,Well a prolific serial killer can kill more people than that per day. Are we not locking down for that?
1,A way to control you and all parents of young people Why do we never hear about Flu Pneumonia asthma allergies TB COPD Lung cancer Are everyone cured of these diseases I do not think so Make all deaths public not just this virus at the same time you put it out
1,The pictures from the streets looks like Belarus… Creepy.
1,Why is antifa so quiet?
1,"I'm watching your video on YouTube now, and Trump's picture is covering over all the video footage you are talking about. Has it been censored? ."
1,Let's see how much we can control. Stand up people. One world order.
1,A dangerous slacker is the one who wont work just to get the money out of my hard earned paycheck.
1,"Thank you Tucker, will now share in masked up and lockdowned Australia"
1,Repulsive Tucker? They are sitting to eat. Didn't you hear? COVID is on time out during meals.😛
1,These people have been watching the Democrats maybe we can get the Democrats to go to Australia and live
1,This hypocrisy and elitism is ridiculous!! Wake up!!
1,Do as I say not as I do! Total hypocrisy!
1,What makes me furious is only servers wearing masks. 🤬🤬🤬 I hope all get Covid but the employees.
1,"🤮 she is an elitist, has absolutely no business giving Americans advice from her glass house 🤨"

But by all means do what feels good for the moment. Who cares if they use it to pass a national abortion ban in 3 years."
1,These solders didn't die because of an absolute shit show of decision making by the president. Soldiers die in war. period. However what happend in Kabul was entirely preventable and a direct result of Bidens botched withdrawal oppertation.
1,Not sure how it minimizes Biden’s failures in any way
1,"I’m talking about this post - per my prior comments. 

Why are we pulling up how trump behaved? He’s out. Biden’s in. Saying “reminder - this is his trump behaved” comes across as saying “well it’s ok Biden screwed this up because what about trump!” 

I’m fine being in the minority on this opinion I just wish the left would stop being so hypocritical."
1,Then shouldn’t us men get a seat at the table for the abortion discussion now?
1,If you can program A Generation of children to believe this kind of bullshit you can easily convince them that America is systematically racist and the vaccinated can be infected by people that aren’t sick.
1,"Whats weirder.   Their contradictions in ""science"" or their love for killing babies?"
1,"My god. What is happening with Gen Z? Can't we returning to the old years where there were Girls and Boys, Women and Men?"
1,"Then men have a say in abortion? Is that the new official ""liberal"" stance?"
1,So it's alright to murder a baby because some people with body dismorphia have babies? WTF is wrong with these people?
1,"If you have two X chromosomes, you’re a female. Last I checked, only humans with two X chromosomes could get pregnant. Doesn’t matter what you identify as or what your birth cert says. Science in this case is fact and if you are pregnant or have gotten pregnant, you are female"
1,"Let me check if a man ever had a baby. 

Nope. Never. 

You know why? Men do not physically have a vagina. 

That’s a scientific fact. But reality doesn’t mean anything to the far-left. If they “feel” it, it’s a “fact.”  

The clowns have taken over."
1,"And we wonder why mental illness is more prevalent on the left?

It's because from the moment they're born, they are fed nothing but alternate reality, anti-science propaganda. 

How in the blue hell can you not end up messed up if you believe the world is X, only to grow up and discover that 98% of the world is Y and you're part of the 2% that believe otherwise."
1,"Well let's see, to leftists, wrong is right, bad is good, down is up, and losing is winning."
1,"Because these dummies think a girl can transform into a dude so when she gets pregnant they think men can have babies...

Reading that logic is like trying to follow a psychopath's mind... unpleasant"
1,"hang on , seriously... I think she might be mentally ill ?what she's saying is beyond lefty nonsense its actually genuinely deranged , even the most ardent of Trans ""female"" activists don't think they can get pregnant ?! you sure shes not a troll?"
1,"This is the same kind of person that says men can't make laws about women's bodies. Yet, according to her logic, men can get pregnant? Hmmm."
1,Lol Females are defined as having eggs and getting pregnant under the concept of mammals. You can do some sort of procedure to put eggs in men; but that is obviously not  a man anymore it's a cyborg.
1,"Anyone else feel like this whole gender thing is a bit of an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" type situation?"
1,Dang the libs need to go to a mental asylum
1,"Leftism is a truly disease, and a with a quick visit to the Front page of Reddit you can clearly see how badly it devastates brain function."
1,"I'm honestly not sure if they are humans anymore. Wondering if the report and the vaccines have anything to do with one another. Seems more likely Liberals are actually just aliens, body snatchers. The vaccine is the delivery mechanism.  


LOL. Please don't think I'm serious.  


But that's what it feels like."
1,I forgot which ivy league school did a study and found that 64% of those that consider themselves liberals have seen a doctor about mental health issues at least once.
1,I never knew stupidity was contagious until I met a leftist and realized they are allowed to reproduce !
1,"I genuinely don't understand how a grown man can vote Democrat. I would rather be associated with *Qanon* or even Flat Earters, than with countless legions of people on the Left, take your pick."
1,"Been saying it for awhile now, liberalism is a mental disorder."
1,I think that person is referring to how people with different sexual identities can become pregnant. The lack of understanding of this could actually be construed as the brain disease.
1,"I'm not sure, because of the username, but I'm getting the sense that this is a troll. but maybe not? I'm not sure. The fact that we can't tell the difference tells you something about the left."
1,"Pretty sure it is a scientific fact--short of being an organism that can reproduce asexually--that only females can get pregnant.  Something about that being the rule for pretty much every species with males and females.  The left is nuts.  Just because you believe something, that doesn't make it fact.  It makes it your opinion.  Opinions are not facts and wishing them so will never make it true.

Being trans is fine if that's how a free individual wants to live.  I literally don't care.  However, it is completely false to claim that men can get pregnant.  It is their opinion that men can get pregnant because it is their opinion that men aren't defined by measurable biological sex characteristics.  Men cannot get pregnant.  Women who want to be men can."
1,"Ok I'll bite. 

Please tell me where the logic falls down.

If a women transitions to being a man, yet still had a uterus, then they can get pregnant and therefore an abortion.

I'm not trying to argue. Genuinely can't see what the point of disagreement is."
1,"I get the sneaking sense that that's actually the point of the post, and it's actually not a leftist post, but rather someone trolling the left. The fact that we can't even tell the difference shows how ridiculous the left has become."
1,"They are called birthing people now. Remember.
The word mother was not inclusive enough.
It also sickens me how so many people are so for infant murder."
1,Brain damage from those vegan diets and getting vaccinated every two weeks for a virus that cannot be immunized. Pretty sure that's why they also want to be forced into totalitarian rule. Severe brain damage and extreme dependence on the teet of big government.
1,"Depends on your opinion.  We only believe in diversity of genitalia and race, not thought."
1,"Well... I'm with you but how about this?......   
  For the folks that say a woman can have an abortion if they want and a man has no say so, then the man should be able to decide whether he wants to pay child support or not!"
1,"Imagine someone saying this just 10 years ago. I guarantee 99% of Democrats would think that this is fucking crazy. 

  
They are just so easily brainwashed."
1,Ever since we started having “fact checkers” which is like the Ministry of Truth in 1984
1,Seeing people denying this biological fact makes me wish there was an actual way to change your biological sex at will so people will shut up about it.
1,"> The funny thing is that they are right. Transmascs and non-binary people with female genetalia can get pregnant. But watch how quick I get banned, because you don't care about the facts, all you care about is ""FuCk ThE LiBs""

They're not right.  Only women can become pregnant.  Men who pretend they are women are not women and can't become pregnant.  ""Non-binary"" is not a sex.  Humans are male or female.  Females can become pregnant, males cannot."
1,"I don’t think trans people don’t exist, I think they living a lie. 

You can’t simply change your gender and go against science and biology simple because your feeble reptilian brain “thinks” so.

I feel like a potato sometimes, doesn’t that mean I can identify as one and force my pronouns on others? No, because one you force others to say something, it’s not about respect and more about manipulation and force.

And back to transgenders, I believe everyone should live their life. If you wanna be XYZ behind closed doors go do so. But don’t make it my problem, and force yours views on me. I think everyone should love themself for who they are. 

Don’t even get me started on forcing kids to choose a gender. It’s stupid and pointless. If a child wants to do something, let them do it, unless it could permanently harm them or hurt them, like hormones. And let’s all agree that a 3 year old might not be able to count their fingers twice and get the same number, let alone choose what they want to be in life. If you were to ask a 3 year old what they wants to be when they grow up, they might say Spider-Man FFS."
1,So why do Cali libs care about Texas abortion laws then? 🤔
1,"I always see liberal media say ""What is the Republican Party's obsession with blue hair?"" and play dumb in the article, as if there couldn't be a more obvious indicator of political beliefs by the cookie cutter look that has evolved. It's funny. I have nothing against blue hair, I just think it's funny that obvious signaling is presented as a united front for those that support the politics behind it, and act like it's surprising that other people notice it."
1,I’m pointing out the obvious hypocrisy of the left saying men can’t weigh in on abortion debate but also men can get pregnant.
1,XXY is sterile so don’t have to worry about abortions
1,"the term trans men its purely  a term I use to be polite , they are not men and never will be men  ..science"
1,"A person who identifies as male but was born with female parts can get pregnant, fact."
1,"Hm? I didn’t say that at all. I said if a man is pregnant, then that man should have the right to decide what to do with his own body."
1,"Oh I know, I'm agreeing and just saying they don't care about the hypocrisy at all. 
 They only care to hear the opinions of those who fall in line with their insanity, while hypocritically claiming they care about diversity."
1,"They can identify as whatever they want, but this hypothetical person is still a female. An XX biological female human being. Female is a biological term. Whatever is going on inside their head doesn't change their biological sex."
1,But men can't call it a societal issue because.......? (Insert elitist liberal hypocritical nonsense here)
1,A man can't get pregnant.  I think you mean a woman who identifies as a man.
1,Then explain how the left is still calling this a wAr oN WoMeN
1,Removed and banned for liberal talking points.
1,"No... I 'got you' on the definition of a virus v a parasite... The rest was to prove you're full on dumb not just half way. 

Dr's, much like states are unfortunately, woefully, pathetically inequal. Its like comparing the basic humanity of Texas vs Cali, its not a proper comparison. 

Those Dr's should lose their jobs."
1,What if you're a pregnant woman? Then it's okay? Just trying to understand the liberal nuance of justifying any and all immoral stances in order to personally benefit

1,It’s crazy how liberal Reddit is. I think it’s brainwashing voter bots or something it’s like the plague. I’ve considered deleting it because most everyone on here is a Biden dick rider. Nice to see some like minded people on here
1,"Joe Biden is the most professional loser I've ever seen. The guy has gotten away with plagiarism throughout his ""career"", election fraud, having a piece of shit son etc. I doubt Democrats will remain in power after 2022-24 if their house of cards start falling next few years."
1,"The Democrats stole the 2020 election, Biden never won in the first place.  But this might all be a blessing in disguise... the incompetence and radical agenda of the Biden administration is showing the country what the left is really about and hopefully that will result in a landslide victories for republicans in 2022."
1,"You're not entirely wrong, but it must be remembered that Democrats collectively and repeatedly vote to put the radical left in charge.

If you hand the radicals the keys to the bus, and keep giving them gas money, knowing they are radicals, you don't get to claim it isn't your responsibility when the bus goes off a cliff."
1,"I share this opinion too. Biden never truly won, I watched it happen on election night and the days after. Although because he's in office now it seems like its given Democrats a taste of what they actually voted for."
1,"Are you serious? Liberal Leftists are the ones trying to disband and overthrow the Government, The Patriots are trying to protect our Free Nation and Government. Patriots wouldn't be supporting America if they weren't supporting the United States Government. Here is the very definition of Patriotic:

"
1,Latest polls show it would still be a close election. That’s how much the left hates Trump. They would rather vote for the second worst possible person for the job that ran as a democrat.
1,"I saw it happen with my own eyes, in Pennsylvania at my local voting place.  We were given the paper ballots and told to fill in our choices with black sharpies, then slide the ballot into this machine that supposedly read the ballots.  The problem was, the sharpies were bleeding through the front-and-back ballots leaving numerous ""extra"" sharpie circles.  Several of us demanded new ballots that we would fill in with regular pens but were told NO, we had to do it their way.  There's no way that any ballot reader machine was getting the correct reading on those ballots.  This was in a top critical county that went Trump in 2016 that normally leans slightly left so no surprise they went out of their way to cheat."
1,"Auxilary, this Subreddit is for Republicans to discuss issues relating to the Republican Party, you have no right to come into our Domain and try to silence us, not to mention making an uncalled for, personal attack on a Reddit user for their username.
  

  
You may think what we say and do here is Incoherent and that's completely fine, but this is our domain and so you can't tell us to stop. Just like if I were to go over to the Democratic Subreddit and start spamming Trump 2024, which I wouldn't do because I'm sensible and formal unlike you are being right now."
1,"Combination of that, but even moreso the fact that the Dems have morphed into a party that doesn't care about morals, truth, facts, or results..  And are obsessed with handouts, freebies, white racism, and wokeism.  They've successfully managed to delude the younger generation on all this. 

So they're going to get at least 45-50% of the vote no matter who is running."

1,"why is the left so determined to repress  ANY alternative to mainstream treatment for C19 , the only reason that makes sense to me big pharma has massive influence over them"
1,"If this is false I would sue for sure...cnn , fake news as always."
1,Def sue cnn then we can see what else cnn lies about
1,"Of course they’re willing to lie to push a narrative. This is nothing new. 

Most all “journalists” are far-left activists. They’ll happily push anything, no matter how ridiculous, to ‘prove’ that anybody that doesn’t think like them is an idiot. 

And their phony “fact-checkers” friends will gladly back them up."
1,Sue for sure. It is defamation of character. It would be an easy win. Then donate winnings to Project Veritas. Nick Sandmann won. CNN needs to be prosecuted.
1,"At this point we might as well be a monarchy where the is a figure head. Our country is ran as a buisness. Import, import, import, spend, spend, spend. Money runs this country as do the corporations. Politicians are men and women trained in manipulation and word play through their education. They gain power, maybe for selfish or selfless reasoning but it always ends up with them stuffing their pockets. 

How else you think things dimwitted democrats have such money? Pelosi is worth over $100m. She didn't get that by GIVING like they all say they want us to do. Big pharma and many, many other corporations pay them off. They talk about being Sweden or Switzerland but that'll never happen when you run a poorly managed buisness where more money leaves what its ment for to go to pockets of assholery. 

Sorry for the rant. Been alittle wound up recently."
1,"yeah its sad people dont wonder where people like Pelosi life long grifters worthless insects , that have done ZERO worth mentioning , get so much money from ,"
1,"The rest aren't, though, which is the whole point.  The whole ""get the vaccine"" crowd have pushed any vaccine you can get your hands on.  And they've been doing it since well before the Pfizer vaccine was approved, so the fact that it is approved now doesn't give them a leg to stand on.  They still pushed experimental substances that were not FDA-approved to be forced on people while using disgusting rhetoric against people who tried other experimental treatments.  It was always an intellectually dishonest position."

1,"Hooray!!!

Lasted longer than needed, but has been helpful in many ways. Even though the shutdowns were not necessary."
1,I truly hope employers look at these fools that are just now coming to work and think twice about hiring lazy people who have worked the system. It’s honestly our lowest performers who have dragged it out this long and I don’t need them working for me.
1,"who wants to bet biden will announce ""my plan is working to reduce the number of unemployed!"" and try to take false credit for it."
1,Too bad they waited so long.   All the good job were taken by people were eager to work taking the jobs of the ones who didn’t.   The only jobs that are left are part times no benefits jobs.   Plenty of fast food restaurant jobs open.   Good luck all.
1,"The problem is that the government was paying people more money than many jobs will, and with our congressional leaders and the president blowing out the spending, inflation is on the rise."
1,I don’t even …. I … the f*** is this?! … People whining because they hate working and want free money?? How… uh… I’m literally flabbergasted… The audacity to those who work their ass off…
1,Depends on how insecure Nancy is feeling this week.  They may find themselves sleeping in parking garages in DC again.
1,"If you want to expand the middle class, secure the border and deport the illegals.  Then those unskilled and low skilled labor jobs will have to pay more in order to get American workers to do them."
1,"While I agree those are annoying problems, it's still not my responsibility to have to pay for you. This is why you have savings or take on temporary work, of which plenty is available. This system is getting more and more convoluted and we need to throw money at every other thing to solve for an issue that throwing money at a different problem created. The government is not our daddy."
1,"Lmao,
Na, Biden probably brought em back to enforce Marshal law on us after the entire Nation revolts."
1,"Yea and have personal discipline.  Plus the term living wage.  You can “live” on very little just look at communist did to everyone.  

You don’t want a living wage you want a wage for doing a low skill job that lets you “live” the way you want."
1,"Exactly.  That's an effective and obvious conservative Republican policy that has popular support, and stopping it makes Democrats look like monsters.  That could've been a piece of a larger proposal, and even if it was shot down, just the idea of actually getting it done would lead to another red tide in the midterms."
1,"Looking at your post history tells me you're anything but a pleasant person. Maybe take a break from brigading non socialist subreddits and purposefully not understanding points. Or maybe its just a bait to get me to argue with you? Either way, you're not an honest person with good intentions here."
1,"Ok then you worked you achieve let everyone else live up to that standard.  

Sorry for assuming but a lot of living wage people just want free money."
1,">The basis behind anti work is just providing the bare minimum shelter, food, healthcare to everyone so they're not 'forced' to work.

Everything essential for living could be provided to an individual but work would still absolutely be required. In fact it would no longer be optional at all. when services are provided for free what incentive is there to do it? I don't know how many people would work in a warehouse for free and the same goes for teachers, doctors, surgeons. These are absolutely essential positions that now need to be assigned rather than staffed voluntarily. You can't just not pay these people.

You can advocate for a higher wages thats fine, but removing or severely reducing salary *(Which would absolutely be necessary in a gov. controlled scenario)* has dire consequences. This is why the USSR had so many problems. Magnitogorsk is a prime example. So many people died in that industrial hell hole due to the sever lack of any real experience since they just assigned random people to work in the mines & foundries. I mean imagine being told to work as an ER tech with no option to leave or find another job else where.

In any scenario where a large group of people are permitted to contribute nothing to society. There is other which must suffer greatly to provide it. If you can't see that your either an idiot or don't want to acknowledge it.

What you want is to be rich without putting in the time."
1,"Yes and we have dumped trillions at this problem and it never gets better. 

So your answer is to poor more money at it.  Government can’t solve this it’s not in their best interest"
1,"So why do you think he's allowing in twice as many illegals as have ever come in before?  Keep in mind, the border patrol only catches between a third and half of those who come across the border, so we'll get something on the order of 6 million this year.

...and do you think employers who can't get Americans to take their jobs will turn up their noses at illegal aliens who will work for less, when the Federal government will turn a blind eye?"
1,Seems like an issue with business owners and not the employees. Maybe they should pay those that live hear a wage that’s livable and they won’t have to hire illegal immigrants?
1,"You could have stopped funding Pakistan a long time ago. You can still introduce sanctions against them. Forget reforming Shariah states, Islamism has infiltrated the American govt in the form of Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. Pakistani and Palestinian lobbyists have politicians from both sides in their pockets. Your campuses, academia,media  and the Democratic party are all cheerleaders and enablers of Islamic radicals. Things like hijab and burkha are promoted by feminists and mainstream media. Gay men support states like Palestine which would happily kill them. How do the hell can all of this be reversed by sticking to ""democratic principles"" and ""natural rights""."
1,"China the foe , will take and hold Afghanistan now, the USA has lost its geological mastery ,thanks to Biden"
1,"One wonders if the American collapse really was foolishness  , or perhaps something worse , Biden has links to China thought Hunter? its very convenient all that expensive equipment was left behind, if the though the militarily is expert at ordered withdrawals , and we all know Afghanistan is basically a huge gold mine resources wise , why is America leaving all that too enemies? Biden is bought and paid for as are the democrats"
1,"They're allowed on Twitter and orange man isn't, the left controls everything and it's upside down"
1,"I hate to say it, but they already are the leader in industry and most manufacturing. Where do you think most batteries come from? Where is a large majority of manufacturing for almost all consumer goods. The US is China's useful idiot. We consume, and therefore fill their pockets. If we aren't already over the barrel, they've at least set it out and readied the chains."
1,"true but things can  always get worse , we could start diversifying imports and lessen the problem,  Trump was doing that, which is probably the  main reason ""they"" deposed him, China has way too many people in is pocket"
1,"The problem is if Republicans somehow by the Grace of God get an upper hand, you won't be ruthless. You continue to want to be the good guy and allow these people to remain. This stuff needs to be stamped out. Marxists and Islamists need to be rounded up and purged from society. Their grip on media and academia needs to be loosened. You can't continue to allow these ideologies to fester because there is no middle ground with them."
1,"Woke radical millenials. They don't have jobs, live at home,  ps5 and social media until 3 am, sleep until noon, don't understand world issues /politics...but the flag looks cool, if I get it I'm cool...Pathetic."
1,"And its funny how if we changed a pride flag for example we would be bashed for it and ""canceled"". such hypocrits"
1,"Do these liberal/ left students really have a grasp on the issues, in the world view? Idt they understand the importance of National Border Energy independence/ security, Afghanistan, etc. Most of the younger people I know (my sons ages), either don't really care about the issues OR they follow the herd and lean left because friends, actors, musicians etc tell then that's what to be?"

1,"Fauci was well aware that specific research into bat cornovirus was taking place at the Wuhan Virology Institute. He specifically approved funding of this type of research. Yet, early in the pandemic he pushed the line that the virus spontaneously popped up in a wet market in the same frigging city where they were studying this specific thing. 

He knew, he lied, and he may very well have been the cause of the entire massive catastrophe that COVID19 and will forever be.  It's not a stretch to make this claim. 

It is entirely possible that the man who was instrumental causing the deaths of over 4.5 million people and the loss of trillions of dollars in economic activity is in fact the same man that is being celebrated as a hero by people like Trevor Noah, John Oliver and others. In fact, there appears to be solid evidence to this.

Someone needs to ask him why he pushed the story that COVID 19 developed in nature when he was very well aware that research into that specific type of very unique virus was being funded by the NIH in the city where the virus originated."
1,Well yeah. Fauci is a known liar. He should be in jail.
1,"He’s also the guy who’s allowed to re-define what is and is not GOF research.

They’ve promoted him as a sort of God-like figure who isn’t to be questioned.   They’ve bashed you and called you a conspiracy theorist crockpot for daring to question him.  

DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO QUIETLY DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM DR FAUCI.   They need to be constantly reminded that the man they put on a pedestal is one of the main reasons we have this virus unleashed upon the world.   Every Democrat you know needs to be confronted with this."

1,"7 million people that sat around for a year.  Who wants to hire that lazy sack.  Millions busted their asses through the entire pandemic and made less money than the people leeching off our tax dollars.  In 9 months that will be an additional 7 million people on welfare.  With high wages, increased taxes, huge inflation on cost of goods all because of the current Marxist, authoritarian regime running this country, how many jobs will be around in a couple of months with 7 million people earning less than what they received in handouts.  Don’t forget to add rent to the equation.  The moratorium is over.  I hope I’m wrong, but I have a negative outlook on this economy."
1,"How could anyone hire someone that hasn’t workforce a year and a half?  I can’t imagine how demotivated an individual that literally did nothing for 18 months.  How will they wake up every morning ready to go to work?  

What I love most is the complete 180 the unions took to defend union members that do not want to take the vaccine.  The teachers union spent over a year telling the public how vaccines and masks are the key to open schools, now they want to fight against vaccine mandates.

These leftist clowns always implode on their own policies and ideology.  Defund the police , no don’t fund the police.  We need vaccines, no vaccine mandate.  1996 Biden, we need to lock up these animals, 2021 Biden, institutional racism.  Turn of the 20th century Democrats, Jim Crow laws and KKK, 1960s Democrats welfare, 2020s Democrats equity and everything is racist.  Nothing they say is true.  It’s all rhetoric.  They don’t even believe the BS they are pandering to the poor.  They are Marxist, authoritarian  and now cultural imperialist by controlling how will live, what to believe and censorship.  It’s all party first and centralize power to a federal , single party system.

They don’t want anyone to have their individual freedom or the right to pursuit happiness.  They want people on government programs.  Those in the middle get to pay for it because any bit of success is due to systemic racism."

1,"I want to push back in the idea that the Dems are outright hemorrhaging minorities.  I think it's important to qualify what's going on here with minorities starting to vote republican. 

Let's look at the 2020 election. The Trump campaign made significant investments in reaching specific minority communities eg. Tejanos in TX, American Indians in NC, and black men in general.

With the first two, the Trump campaign used messaging that spoke specifically  to those groups. Acknowledging their history, and issues specific to them. In contrast the Dems reached out to those groups as members of the ""BIPOC"" Community. The idea of BIPOC people as a group was created by the left and is defined by their ""shared oppression"". This allowed Trump to win groups which republicans never won.

Trump was able to blunt the Dem edge with black men both through his personal appeal and superior messaging. Saying, if I'm president the economy will be so good you can get rich. But again the Dems just lumped them under the BIPOC label and told them if you like trump you're not black.

In conclusion Trump was able to either blunt the Dem edge or win outright with specific minority groups by tailoring messaging for those groups and giving them an optimistic as opposed to a pessimistic message.  The takeaway is that Trump's approach is replicable and useful, but requires significant investments in crafting proper messaging and finding the right groups to target."
1,"Great question. Sorry for not including information (this is something that is practically common knowledge in my circle - apologies)

See [

Also Twitter is a good metric as well [ 

Currently there is 0 coverage from MSM - in fact any coverage is anti-Ethiopia pro-interventionist (akin to Libya).

Here are some sources to why I thanked Senator Jim Inhofe & Sec. Pompeo.

1,"THis is the true reason for left decay- they are so adamant to stick to lost causes-keep telling us biden is a good person, man can get impregnated, islamic threats to civilized world are exaggerated, we are doing our best for the border and covid crisis.....but as reality unfolds they are found out again and again and again"
1,"Many didn't believe me before and many won't believe or agree with me now on things we are seeing now. They call me a conspiracy theorist even though that is a term coined by the CIA. They call me an extremist because what I say evades their understanding of the world. 

Listen to me! Don't get the vaccine. Global climate change is a hoax. Jesus is Lord and Savior. And yes! TRUMP is coming back, much sooner than 2024 as President."

1,"Maybe it's time republicans stop complaining about double standards, and engage in them instead. 

Republicans should be ok with the idea of political persecution of Democrats in washington. 

Implement term limits, and keep your soul as the electorate, and there's no issue with the extremes republicans should go to when punishing democrats politically."

1,Biden is a piece of shit on a napkin
1,"biden makes me cry in embarrassment
can you believe people still support this guy? 😞"
1,Dems are the most spiteful obstinate group of reckless and morally corrupt people. All they want is to devastate the core foundations of decency all because someone they courted back in the early 2000s decided to not play ball with them and instead ran as their opposition. The strategy is to convey ineptitude and all the negatives they couldn’t pin on 45 during this potato regime. They embody all the worse they criticize in others. A self licking ice cream cone.
1,Finally someone beats Jimmy Carter as the most worthless President in history although they both agreed that Middle East oil costs to much but there’s nothing we can do unless we hire someone more Trump-Like to take over for ole Joe.

1,"> Have you ever been at a bar to watch a football game and didn't support the troops by not standing for the Televised national anthem?

Right, because that's remotely in the same ballpark. Biden got these people killed, then couldn't be bothered to show an ounce of decorum for the 45 minute ceremony. He then went on to roll his eyes at the mother of one of the dead marines, among other things, and wouldn't shut up about his own son."
1,"Haha seriously? You have the Commander in Chief and hes checking the time instead of respecting the fallen soldiers of his FAILED PLAN. Yes, President Trump was going to evacuate the troops but sleepy Joe had no plan. He fucked up, he disrespected the fallen soldiers for making sure it wasnt time to take his dementia medication. Joe is a joke."
1,"The Dumbocrats don't care about ANYONE except themselves - sure, it's virtue signaling for political brownie points - doesn't make it any less vile"

INCOMPETENCE on a breathtaking scale. Perhaps our worst foreign policy debacle ever. And to further exhibit his senility, Biden now excitedly CONGRATULATES himself about Afghanistan---how's THAT for irony? 🙄😁"
1,"So bad that people were stuck inside their homes that were set on fire by people? So bad that business buildings burned? So bad that historic statues were damaged? Buildings, cars and more were vandalized? People by themselves were beaten in the streets? Nah. At least on Jan 6, the people peacefully appeared, to the location of the source of our problems. I do not support violence, vandalism or any of that, but It was Antifa and BLM that screwed it up again in this case. Made it look bad for the innocent.

Heros have died for our constitution and our freedom,  NOW IT IS UP TO US TO MAINTAIN THAT FREEDOM! Dig up strength from deep within yourselves. These radical leftists and anti Americans (who have fallen victim to the media) will never get the best of us or our country. If anyone doesn't like it here then they can move out of the USA. PERIOD.

He has caused more destruction to our country faster than any President  that has ever served. We must remove him asap to give our country a fighting chance to save our country. Please contact  our goverment and let your voice be heard. The phone numbers you can call at the capitol to let your voice be heard is 202-224-3121   202-225-3121.

1,Lol the MSM won't even acknowledge Bidens Dementia but happy to smear Trump nice
1,"We absolutely love everything President Trump says, and we really enjoy watching his rallies.... Everything Trump says is spot on and so accurate.... As for myself, what I like best is listening to President Trump insult everyone that insulted him first.... That's called ""RETALIATION"", and something I can seriously relate to when I use to be verbally bashed in grade school, and it wasn't until I reached High School when I started retaliating..... Yes, over the past 5 years, from 2016 to 2021, all I heard was the Dems & Libs bashing & bashing & for 4 years, and President Trump retaliating & retaliating & retaliating..... and all I saw was the Dems & Libs rioting at ""INSIDE"" the US Capital in 2017 (yes, they broke inside & rioted), and there were countless street riots all over the country during President Trumps entire term...... ENJOY YOUR CNN & MSNBC FAKE NEWS & the HIGH GAS PRICES in your state because you all deserve it for voting for a Dem."
1,At least he spoke for himself. That’s more than I can say for Biden. What is wrong with people? Stupid or what.
1,There's no one more childish  than the Democrats!
1,Have this guy break down Joe Biden’s horrible speech.
1,you cannot win the south if you recognize that abortion is legal and that women should be treated like human beings? Oh dinosaur go away
1,Thank GOD for Hurd & the  others who care abt People to keep America strong!!!  We know trump just said what many of them didnt say just like they didnt speak up to their own party when they were wrong but now expect the DNC to do what the rnc refused to do for them!!!
1,"You folks still griping about trump. And biden don't even know what planet he is on. Liberalism is a mental disorder. Of that, I have no doubt."
1,I've never seen racism like the Democrats use it..... It's quite disgusting.... And very racist
1,Democrats use racism is a tool.!!   Just a game they play ?  A card in their deck ??  Trump is no racist the Democrats are !!!
1,Will not matter this country is going red !!     And we don't want Rino's...we the people are sick of Rino's. ....Dems are scared !    Everybody knows it's the dems push the racism because they're the racist....it's there tool....
1,I think these guys need to look at the massive rally the Trump had.  He is still very popular and his popularity is gaining strength with every failure that people see from our new administration.
1,"I'm very optimistic for the republican party. Eventually, the republican party will part with the minority of people in their party who are militant racists, which is great. 
Trump is not a republican; he is his own entity. 
And he is causing an acceleration of change in the republican party, which I'm happy about. 
The democrats are fooling themselves if they think there are no racists in their party.
The democratic party is loaded with racists,too, I beleive. 
My hope is that the republican party will soon roll out the red carpet for conservative democrat minorities to swing to the republican party, and the core beliefs of conservatism, which starts with less government."
1,The cops getting the anarchist back! Outstanding police work! BACK THE BLUE!!

It will get worse before it gets better.  An this american is against this marriage type. 
God made Man first then He saw that Adam needed a helper, and then He made woman, from Adams rib.  
REPENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Are you people seeing what at 1:43 Obama says its not about how you start out as if , he's sending our children on the way to conversion of this lifestyle, and he was about to make the same point about out you intercourse right after that."
1,"Poor American children, they're going to live in a country full of sexual degradation, were their is no clear definition of the roles set up by mother nature and also where their lowest animal instincs take first place. All in the name of, do what ever makes you happy as long as you don't hurt nobody. What a bunch of BS."
1,Being Gay has nothing to do with being an American!. Dang G I thought you were a Nica. You just a pawn. Can't wait till the next President hopefully they will undo all this Gayness and get back to business like Bush.
1,"A key aspect to a happy world is harmony. Harmony consists everybody. Harmony is influential. Happiness is influential. Those two things don't exist in the overall human race because of a lot of set backs. One key thing that divides the human race is the difference in ethics. Good ethics or morals are principles that contribute to Good conduct and good conduct is a positive influence that contribute to harmony. Good ethics should be universal around the earth just like a smile generally means happiness around earth.

Here's the thing. Besides all the crime and misery that contribute to this sick world that has it's negative influence, you also have loose morals (let's say loose conduct for better understanding) and loose conduct has it's negative influence. Example, parents that regularly curse around their kids might influence their kids even if they tell them not to do it. Homosexuality, is, loose, conduct. It has it's influence as you can clearly see around you in today's world. It, contributes, negatively, to, humanity. How?

Homosexuality challenges the importance of ethics, logic and reasoning. Three common things you need for wisdom and Three common things that are challenged in committing crimes like murder, domestic violence, rape etc.. When you challenge those things in regards to the ethics of sexuality, it attacks the meaning of ethics in general and attacks the human cognition like, 'if I could do this I could do even more' which could lead to recklessness. It also attacks the meaning on quality of life, like how a person experiences life. Influence effects your motivations and your mental and physical wellbeing, and it's contagious because it effects you and everyone else.

So how is homosexuality truly beneficial to those doing it and to humanity? The world is like a family household, if one thing is out of place, everything is. So we all have a part on contributing to earth and humanity, it's best to be in harmony not disarray. But this world won't be in harmony with loose conduct, that's one key reason why the world is the way it is today.
"
1,God is a gentlemen like it or not this only means that God is even closer to come and God word will never change perfect creator in everything. Repent of all sins all. santan will never ever have his way he couldn't before Christ or after this time either.
1,"So gays can now be together and ""have kids"". Then those kids can be severely bullied during parent teacher night by other kids, then they can be beat up during high school years and possibly commit suicide. If we were all gay, human reproduction would come to a stop. Science can't create life. Only man and woman can."
1,Obama is full of shit.
1,"~No One Born Gay
NO ONE is born Gay. There is no scientific proof that people are born Gay. There is ZERO proof. ZERO! There is not a ""Gay Gene."" This is a fairy tale. People believe deceptive lies. They say, ""Gays were born that way."" That's just as ignorant as saying, ""Child Molesters were born that way."" Or ""Thieves were born that way."" Or ""Adulterers were born that way."" HOW STUPID! WHAT A GREAT BIG LIE! NO! People are NOT born Gay. People are born with a CHOICE! People are not ""born that way."" People are born with a CHOICE! LIFE IS A CHOICE! People are born with a CHOICE! People CHOOSE right or wrong. People choose to live for God or for themselves. They CHOOSE to walk in darkness or walk in light. And people will be judged by God for the choices they make. NO! People are NOT born Gay. People are born with a CHOICE!

God's Word is perfectly clear. It says Gay, Homosexuality and Lesbianism is wrong. Gays, Homosexuals and Lesbians will not go to Heaven...they will go to Hell! [1 Cor.6:9,10]. The the sexually immoral... their place will be in the fiery Lake of Burning Sulfur."" [Rev.21:8]. God's Word calls homosexuality ""degrading of the body, shameful, indecent and perversion."" [Rom.1:24-32]. NO! People are NOT born Gay or ""born that way."" People are born with a CHOICE! A CHOICE to choose right or wrong. A choice to live for themselves and their selfishness or to live for God. ""Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve."" [Josh.24:15]. People are born with a CHOICE! They CHOOSE whom they will serve. P.S. Even if a person were born Gay, which is a BIG lie, people can be changed by being ""Born Again"" and by SELLING OUT THEIR LIFE 100% TO CHRIST!"
1,Obama will take down this country eny way he can
1,"How is it that homosexuals condemn Christians for their opinion on homosexuality but yet allow a Christian ordained minister to marry them? Jesus loved all people but i don't think Jesus would ever support gay marriage.Jesus Christ underscored the importance and sacredness of lifelong marriage in his own teachings.He quoted from both Genesis 1 and 2,stating in Matthew 19:13-6 that God had created humanity as male and female,and that in marriage""the two will become one flesh.Therefore what God has joined together,let no one separate.Man maid anti law can never be natural law."
1,"Logic dictates Obama, is a sick in the head lying twisted evil psychopathic liar named Barry Saetoro, the king of krapp, IMHO, the supreme court had no right to hear these cases and should be thrown out, not voted in by the people who cares what they say.unless you get what you want, right?  move to impeach those robed fruit loops. evil exists and these narcissistic freaks will do anything to get votes by breaking the laws of the land and something that was decided long ago. using feeding entitlement whores for votes. words just aren't enough."
1,"Last month, Obama was honored by Israel where he was wearing a yarmulke and standing at the bimah and called himself ""honorary member of the tribe"". But gay marriage is BANNED in Israel. Now, he hails gay marriage. What a fucking hypocrite asshole we have as president. No wonder Democrats try to gain gay votes by passing gay mariage through their liberal contacts at the Supreme Court."
1,The fact that 9 judges had to vote on something that affects millions of people shows that the federal government has too much power. This is thanks to liberals and their communist policies.
1,"God hate's hyprocite's who cannot understand the work of his hand's,just like water has it's purpose of drinking, a man is ment for a woman,you can believe the secular world all you want,but there is proof that Jesus christ walked this earth..one day he will come and nobody knows the time and hour But God has placed signs for you to know repent and turn to him and his word get to know him, a child can tell right from wrong from the start,even animal's know there objective is to reproduce,Jesus law is the law of love,some ignorant people are even believer's and still Gay..they believe what they want to believe and go on there own moral's..listen going to hell is an extreme mistake you will regret for all eternity,God gave a warning before and to show you his grace and mercy and his character i will share a scripture about what he told the israelites when they turned from him and started doing wicked things,Ezekiel 33:11 Say to them, 'As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?'
..Please do not reply to me if you do not believe in the unseen such as heaven or hell or Angel's or demon's,Remember God Allows you to have free will And The Devil is running around doing whatever he pleases,I pray that God get's glory from this,some thing's happen so the wolf's can be separated  from the sheep,and no i do not hate gay people,this is a calmly written message if you have arguement please dont reply. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law,There is a 2nd death,and Jesus told us about the free gift of eternal life"

1,God made Adam to  sleep with Eve NOT Steve!!!  Sad day in America!!
1,This speech means nothing really and his doing it because he has to not because he wants to.Like slavery gay marriage is no better it's wrong so say r call me what u want but what kind of thinking it this.The door has been open now to a lot more mess and I think it sad that our young generation has no clue to what they r doing r where they r going.I will never teach my kids that this is ok but don't hate and stay straight.U can love without adding another twisted issues to a pot that's full.

1,"Jesus condemned homosexuality when speaking about sexual immorality. [Mk.7:21-23]. He said sexual immorality makes a person unclean, defiled and polluted. This word sexual immorality means illicit and immoral sex. Which includes prostitution sex, adultery sex, incest sex, GAY or HOMOSEXUALITY sex and LESBIAN sex. Jesus said sexual immorality, which includes Homosexuality, make a person ""unclean, defiled and polluted!"" God's Word says, ""Keep the marriage bed undefiled, uncontaminated, unsoiled, for God will judge the sexual immoral."" [Heb.13:4]. God will judge the Sexually Immoral and all sex outside of the marriage bed. The marriage bed is to be uncontaminated."
1,lol communist spew
1,I'm from Virginia and I'm voting for Trump !
1,Lol. Killary voted for the iraq war which killed the son of the khan family....regressive liberals are hypocrites

1,hillary is fucking shit
1,Kahn is a con. Who politicizes their own son's death to push a false narrative? Total liberal operative; part of the clinton machine. Alinsky playbook 101.
1,Trump for president!
1,"Trump will defend ""Article XII"" of the Constitution to the death. It means that much to him."
1,"My entire family  support the  democrat  candidates all the time , but this time we all are for Trump. Hillary has no moral and ethic, and her policies will make his country a sh$t hole, a paradise for rapists, illegals and drug dealers. If she thinks that she  is in comfortable positions,  and will win  the election based on the recent  poll then she is living on a fantasy world. When any one will go to the poll the only things that matter is who has the better agenda for this country between Trump and Hillary. All the medias are bias, and I am saying it  again as a  lifelong democrat."
1,"Make no mistake, their son is an American hero, he made the ultimate sacrifice for this country........not the parents! The parents were used like puppets for the DNC, and in my eyes it was in poor taste. All to push their narrative. Like it or not Trump will be the next President, and as a veteran....I can't wait."
1,"Has anyone bother to look into Mr Khan association with the Clinton's Foundation?  Someone called him out that he's getting paid by the Clinton's.  Confirm / Deny?  
Mr Khan's son die as a hero and people of this country (at least I am) is forever grateful for his sacrifice.  It's just feel wrong that he would use his son's honor to benefit people like the Clintons."

1,This is 100% political theatre.  Ted Wheeler is universally hated by progressives in Portland and he knows it.
1,"Wheeler is such a dork he should be a regular on the Young Turds. Portland City employees are being made to get vaccinated , but yet he still clings to ""my body my choice""! What about that little babies choice? Oh wait it can't vote."
1,I live in Portland and this is just performative. Today Wheeler said the police don't have to comply with city employees vaccine mandate after the police union threatened to quit. He's totally ineffective. People are trying to recall him.
1,Democrats ❤️ killing babies

Commander in Chief change our country does not change it grows and the growth. has got to be strong and positive. Schooled I don't see any reason why they can't be open if we have school choice then parents can decide what school they will go to or if they will be homeschooled but now they can get online K through 12, you can also get a college degree by studying and being educated through your computer connected to a college and get your degree you don't have to sit in a classroom to learn anymore it's nice to have the, interaction of classmate and a teacher or instructor to answer questions to put things in perspective. I could see students doing most of their studies online and once or twice a week actually face-to-face with an instructor teacher that can go through their material with them do any explanations that I needed help them with any corrections that are needed it's a simple thing nobody has to make this such a big deal. All we have to do is vote America first and there's only one way to go for that and it's Donald Trump the man who wrote The Art of the deal nobody can do better than him he's the master of the deal and that's what our country needs a strong force but never got down that has a good view of the future and what it could be like one way or the other and I'm all for the one way Donald Trump. God Bless America God bless our commander in chief let us be great again."

1,"With dems, EVERYTHING is rigged misreported, polls included. See, the puppet masters figured it out long time ago, with mass printing and TV, all they had to do is keep lying about reality and distributing it through the media, and people would believe it. How about let's not do that anymore?"
1,"The only thing that has a chance to defeat President Trump is fraudulent mail-in voting, I can't go fishing without a license and proof of identification To get it yet, anyone that Sneaks across the border 24 hours before the election can vote for a democratic socialist!!!!!!!!  Or better yet if you're a democratic socialist just stuff the mailboxes with fraudulent Ballots, apparently nobody really checks anything. What good does your vote do if it's effectively nullified by several hundred fraudulent ballots? Any argument against having to show voter ID is just absolutely stupid, Not to mention absolutely crooked!!!"

1,"I don't trust any of these elected official polls. 
  No matter who does it it's biased. 
   Only idiots vote on them things anyways. 
   I'm going to vote for trump 2020. 
  I get ads for polls through his campaign all the time. 
   I never vote on them. 

   If you send out a poll to a group of ppl who approve of you, then the results are irrelevant. 
  That's what most if not all of these polls are always anyways. 
   A poll they sent out to ppl that they already know like them. 
   Or they only poll a select group of ppl. 
  A poll that they or ppl that support them paid for or conducted. Etc.

   It's hilarious. It means absolutely nothing. 
  Most ppl who are actually going to vote, don't waste their time with meaningless polls. 
   It shouldn't even be a topic of conversation."

1,We stand with Trump
1,"Well said. Just because they got the American citizenship, does not make them Americans. And with anti Semitic comments plus pro Al qaeda comments like that, they should be stripped off of their citizenship. Trump was and IS a Great President."
1,Exactly.... she has a problem with feeling racially profiled....well she needs to go make that difference in her country of origin. When immigrants of all nationalities first come to this country you just fit in and live.
1,I totally agree with President Trump
1,If you hate our country then please leave nobody is going miss you. Wonderful statement.

WHAT A PAIR THEY ARE.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GOD BLESS US FROM THEM.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Kamala is even an even more radical anti-American than Biden, so I'm afraid if Biden does get impeached, will have just gone from the frying pan to the fire, and then there's Pelosi, so God help us all with this triangle of evil ruling our nation."
1,"Tucker consistently nails it
2nd only to Limbaugh’s opening monologues he used to do."

1,It disgusts me to watch the US be ran by a criminal administration.  When will Americans get big enough balls to actually do something about it?? PRESIDENT TRUMP WON!
1,"""part of a divine group of leaders.""

1,"Sounds like they are turning Kamala Harris into Princess Diana. 

America has no thought what she will do. Because she is a pawn of the right color, but does not have the ability to think on her feet. 

If you asked me, all this time we’ve been told that White people are systemically racist. On the contrary. White people really aren’t but the people of color will vote for someone who is there color despite that the one most of note was a RED DIAPER BABY!"
1,"I'd say it's a good time for Trump to demand the reins be handed back over to him since they were illegally & fraudulently withheld from him, for all this time anyway."
1,Does AOC know...anything?
1,"They, the liberal left, have no problem whatsoever removing a baby from a mother’s womb, all be it a full term or not, but yet they do supposedly have a problem with removing a child from a mother entering the border illegally. How upside down is that?"
1,AOC is the only waitress that can’t bring something to the table.
1,"AOC is a real credit to her worshippers, the American left 😂 both have no sense"
1,"AO-C want 200,000 Afganistan in the US. Let's put them in her districts, we will have an American Afgan representatives from that district, win win.  People cross the border, with no means of supporting their children or commit crimes are separated from their kids all the time."
1,How embarrassing for you AOC!!!!!!!
1,AOC your actually a Marxist....an Atheist and out of your mind!! Do your homework and stop putting the kids in danger and let illegal immigration happen..... you have done nothing to make things better.....you are bought and paid for!!!!!! This isn't something YOU have discovered!!!!!!!!
1,This started when AOC and the rest of her screwed up party started recruiting foreigners to migrate to our borders and instructed them to break our laws!
1,"Kinda funny. The crisis at the border is 10 times worse now than it was then. Has anyone heard AOC whining lately about ""kids in cages?"" Yeah, I thought not. Hypocrites!!!!"
1,"People talk a bout the dangers of White supremacy but I see in AOC, the danger of Dumb supremacy."
1,AOC need to be removed from her position because she doesn't know anything and all she knows is how to read from a piece of paper smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
1,AOC the smartest dumb girl ever.
1,"Does she actually care about family separation and the family unit? Absolutely not. How can someone on the left support abortion and all the heinous school indoctrination (neither of which regard all human life as precious) and then make this argument? The Left is doing all they can to destroy the family unit and replace God with government. 
Pray for children and the future of our nation. 
-A Stay at Home Mom"
1,"Its illegal so you can shoot them down right ?
They are illegal so you can seperate children from their parents....

There is something called proportionality in law and AOC is right... Most people are just racist and have no clue what they are talking about...."
1,"AOC lying again!
She is the most dishonest politician in Washington!"
1,"When AOC speaks, she can make a tree stump look like a genius."
1,AOC is a child that needs to grow up. She’s all feelings.
1,"What a joke! Boy she tried to twist the narrative but he answered her with TRUTH and up holding the USAs laws upon entry into this country. You know something. Maybe some one has answer. Why do they (you know who “they” are) want to  become an American citizen, but WANT TO CHANGE EVERYTHING OUR COUNTRY STANDS FOR? God, family, country! 
Lee, Grant, Calhoun, Stonewall Jackson, the men still today in the Marines, Army, Air Force, Navy... who fought (fighting) to KEEP OUR FREEDOMS. 
Get your Bibles
Get your guns
Get ready..."
1,AOC wants to be Fidel Castro so bad
1,Arrest the illegals period
1,"Humm let’s think , illegal boarder crossing , it in the name it’s a crime  “ illegal “. She claims to of gone to college , that seems questionable !"
1,Getting older is a given. Growing up is optional. Some people are happy to be juvenile all their life and AOC is a prime example.
1,A.O.C Talieb and Omar Should Be Locked Up In Prison For Treason Against The American People and Humanity
1,Does AOC   '' WAKE  UP ''  Or Not After This Hearing Or Is She Basically  '' LOST '' !!!!!
1,"AOC is a huge hypocrite because she advocates by her actions what she seeks to deny in her rhetoric. Like everything on the left, she lies very well about what she is actually doing."
1,The people that created the covid vaccine  (derick Rossi and some women Karol.) we’re supervised by dr fauci at the nih.  I think there’s some kinda conspiracy goin on here.   Really!!!!!
1,"It upsets me that people see Fauci as the big savior, and he was the instigator and supervisor of the production of this virus."
1,The American public will pay the price for allowing this senile puppet and his masters to destroy the christian fabric of this nation. Destruction is coming America!
1,When injustice is law resistance is duty. Thomas Jefferson.  It's time to vote them out and stop this communist takeover that world leaders want to control.
1,"Fauci knows nothing, he's being controlled by demons, the W, H, O, Bill Gates,and the New World Order, he knows the vaccine is spreading the virus and killing people."
1,"The masks begin to fall off!
 ""The Chinese biological laboratory in Wuhan is owned by Glaxosmithkline,  which (accidentally) owns Pfizer!""

1,"Exactly what I thought and knew and heard about a long time ago. 90% of any death has the hash tag, ""death by Covid"", even if the reason is ridiculous"
1,Frankenstein fauci facilitates appocolytic viruses! coverup specialists! Resulting in mail in ballots results Venezuela style election! landslide at midnight! Come on man!
1,"The President, (""our President of the United States""), has just not only saved the United States Citizens, ""(our family members)"";' but He, has saved the World also with this vaccine.. We the People,  and the World;  ( ""THANK YOU"",; President TRUMP ),."
1,"I will never take that poison and I will die fighting it this is a government conspiracy to weed out the population, let them give it to the black and brown illegal communities first"
1,"We know the hospitals were making money for the reported covid diagnosis. The government paid hospitals: $13k per day every patient, for every ventilator used $48k, for every 120 patients reported to have covid $$78 k..  Hospitals wanted deaths reported as covid causes, although few were actually for covid, because it was a money maker!!!"
1,Scam by democrats! They all belong in jail!
1,"Plandemick! Dems, china and fauci  did this to pull off there coup!"
1,Dr Fauchi was deeply involved in the creation of this virus together with Bill Gates
1,COVID-19 numbers are just as inflated as Biden’s alleged votes
1,"Within 2 years, the Vaccinations will kill more people, than the virus. SM-102 ☠"
1,"I heard er has been told to list all deaths even gunshot as Covid.
This is to keep the numbers up and Validate the need for Vax.
Like N. Korea, ""You can lead a Country with Fear."""
1,Fauci needs to be Prosecuted for War Crimes.
1,What I am witnessing everyday is extremely bothering. Folks having so much fear won't even take off a mask while outside although the CDC indicated those vaccinated can. Once we lose faith in the air we breathe we are deeply at a lost . Never chose to wear a mask outside since mask wearing became prevalent nor have any interest in taking a vaccination. Are we forgetting the power of our own immunity system. I cherish the sciences as well as a healthy lifestyle. The immunity systems will fight off anything if we took care of ourselves accordingly. Stop allowing your system to turn into a garbage disposal. Take time to do some form of exercise.
1,It's all in the leftist socialist agenda.
1,Covid created to rig an election. yrs. later still under the same oppression. And not letting anytime soon. And the wezel troll still can't make up his mind to wear face diapers or not.
1,Good for you. They are trying to push the  vaccine. We need to all stand up and say enough  NO
1,"Why is that indeed ! Its never been about a virus...its about the great reset....why do all these talking heads refuse to acknowledge that ,I wonder...Not bad data collection its treason  The great reset.Soros Gates IMF , W E F , etc...why do they hide that fact ???"
1,"It’s totally unethical and to place the carrot (💰💵💵💰) of money , Dangling in  front of Hospital Administrators and Doctors at the complete disregard for a Human’s Life ....    MONEY FOR DIAGNOSIS ... MONEY FOR ADMISSION FOR COVID ..... MONEY FOR ICU ADMITS ..... MOST MONEY FOR ICU PATIENT PLACED ON VENTILATOR WHO SUCCUMBS ..... I CAN SEE HOW THE MAJORITY OF CHRISTIANS BELIEVE THIS IS THE (Devil’s Game) (THE Bill Gates of Hell  opened and now SWALLOWING HUMANITY = The Profiteering Bill Gates)"
1,Dont believe the fake media. Covid is not anything they say it is .its all about them trying to get there bioweapon jab that is only meant to take you out
1,"Thank you, Great One. I have heard reports that if someone dies in a car crash and a post-mortem blood test (to see if alcohol or drugs were a cause of the crash) finds the The COVID virus or its antibodies, then the  cause of death on the driver's death certificate is listed as ""COVID-19."""
1,Thjank you President Trump and the TEAM for exposing fraud waste and abuse in the medical Industrial Complex. Credibility of Medical Doctors and the like is being questioned. Thats a good thing.

1,Trump 100% Real Man
1,This man has class and is a true American. Unlike the garbage that is in there now and they called us deplorables. Bet you China Joe Burden can't even spell deplorables. Wonder if he can spell basement or theif or crime boss or drug addicted son ? Wonder if he knows where he is today? He's just lost mental health poster child. He is an embarrassment to our country as is his administration don't you think?

Inflation. Border Crisis. Supply shortages. Multiple hackings. Currency devaluation. Looming war with China and threats of Nuclear attacks on US soil. Race war. Culture war. Increasing medical costs. Unstable markets and housing bubble. Vast overreaching regulation by the ATF. Trillions added to debt. .......... and this list could go on and on. 
We are 4.5 months into with Democrat controlled Congress and we are in a rapid decline that millions of people will never see coming. 
Now is the time to pray like never before,  practice frugality, and spread wisdom through kindness. 
God Help Us in the months to come. We are going to need it."

1,The same people wanting to disarm citizens want to defund the police but want citizens to depend on the police instead of protecting themselves hmmm
1,I am pro-gun👍👍
1,Classic Democrat non answer
1,the poor antifa (hollywood actors) are afraid of guns . it makes their riots too dangerous.
1,"The anti gun activists over exaggerating to make their case don't use logic or common sense!!!! People who own A -R 15 don't walk around with it when they're out in public.  They most always keep it at home to DEFEND themselves, their family and their property.  Anyone who carries a gun with them carries a handgun.  
AND PEOPLE WHO CARRY A GUN ON THEM FOR SELF DEFENSE DON'T ACT AS VIGILANTES.  IF HE DOESN'T WANT A GUN FOR SELF DEFENSE, THAT'S HIS DECISION AND RIGHT..
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYONE ELSE HAS TO !!!!!!!!"
1,Women do not marry a Democrat. They don't even know how to protect their own. They'll just watch while you and your children are molested or at worst killed
1,"A gun is like a parachute,  if you ever need one and dont have it , you'll probably never need one again.  !! 
 The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun, is a good guy with a gun.  You may not believe in god and you might not believe in guns.  But if I kick in your door at 2 am with a knife.  The first 2 things you're going to do is 1 call someone with a gun and 2 pray they get there in time 🤷‍♂️"
1,"I could respect you more if you just gave up and said I have no answer for that. This is why we have to beat the dead horse, because clowns like this think we should just wait for the police, guess what sir they've been defunded, they're not coming."
1,"We have vp biedumb to our rescue. He couldn't pull his thumb out of his ass without pelosi holding his nasty balls. God help Us. Thank you fox for this National Treasure. It would not have been possible without fox, cavuto and walace."
1,You'll never win an argument with a liberal. They're too stupid to learn.
1,"Another idiot. So if younuse ""assault type weapon"" in self defense does that now change the weapon to defense type weapon? Another one that wants to strip the law abiding citizen from any means of self defense and rely on government... Socialist maybe?"
1,"This SOCIALIST is a COMPLETE MORON. You Sir, have the choice to walk down the street without a firearm. Good for you but don't INFRINGE on my Right to the Second Amendment and my Right to DEFEND my Family and myself!"
1,"What, exactly, is wrong with being a vigilante? If that’s the price for exercising my constitutional rights, call me so. It bears being dead.
I’m 66 years old, I’ve had to show a firearm twice. Both times, it ended the threat."
1,"Uh, aren't these the same idiots calling all police racists and attempting to defund the police but now they're saying to rely on the police and trust the system of law? REALLY!!! These idiots truly don't have a clue.  

Plus, I can't rely on the police since y'all idiots keep blocking the streets as you riot and protest the same police you want me to call in an emergency. No thanks, I'll stick with my guns and not have to worry about calling the police."
1,"Criminals by nature don't five a F about the law. Make guns illegal and only the criminals will have them. I'd like to think these anti 2A people have a sinister agenda, but knowing many of them, most of them are deeply naive and unfortunately stupid. And then there are those with an agenda. We have 2A exclusively for ""them""."
1,"Hasn't Mexico outlawed private ownership of guns? Well, now the country is awash with cartels who can do pretty much whatever they want to the unarmed civilians, and they do."
1,300 lb. black man is an idiot!
1,Brainwashed a smart person to get USSR results.  Apparently method still works. Senator Boxer former california “representing” California called for all gun owners to voluntarily turn in weapons.  She made a BIG deal in media coverage of putting her guns into pile.  ... later it was discovered she kept UNREGISTERED guns at home. This man was brainwashed.  So defund police is next step in his future or stand up to defend his American rights under constitution. Which will it be?  He has right to abdicate but should respect everybody else’s right to protect themselves OR head off to China for more intense indoctrination and loss of all his finances under great reset - China leads world in use of social media to control everyone.  First rule down that path is disarm population. Communists ALWAYS do that. So do dictators.
1,Such an idiot guns are so we can defend ourselves from the government he is a commuist why they bring this people ajoke
1,Typical democrat can't answer the question and they also are against our second amendment rights and nazi 🇩🇪 mentality when it comes to firearms 🔫!!!!!!!
1,"Why does the left feel that every law abiding firearm owner, owns one to use it on other humans?  Something tells me that those who are against firearms are just telling you ""what"" they would do if they owned a firearm!  Lesson being, those against firearms should not be allowed to own, or even handle, a firearm."
1,Democrats are so dumb.
1,"That guy didn't care that the attacker had a gun. 
He was more worried that the victim shouldn't have a gun to protect him or her self. 
The criminals will always have guns 🔫 even when they are ban."
1,Liberals are just so dumb.
1,"Liberals: the police are racist Nazis and should be defunded
Liberals: only the police should have guns

1,"Biden administration failed all categories of the US Constitution and Declaration of Independence. They stole the (videos of Absolute Proof by Michael Lindell) election and don't care about the USA citizens. They appease the gullible while they skim off the assets they call ""relief,"" ""covid,"" ""global warming "" or ""infrastructure "" bills are to aid other countries they themselves have invested in. China's road initiative are all from USA citizens tax money."
1,"Americans need to fight to get Trump back into office. At least Trump fights against corruption, were as Biden is so corrupt to the core."

1,Woke left destroying America … losers
1,"Actually, the offended cancel culture babies have taken something away from the Native American by denying them tributes to their ancestry. Those titles of teams as respectful and honorable. It is a shame the Indian nation did not see it that way and come in defense of the team and themselves.  This isn't the first time this has happened. The cancel culture couldn't care less if the native American dropped out of sight into obscurity and eventual extinction.  
Shame on the native Americans for not speaking out in defense of themselves."
1,Democrats are the biggest racist on Earth an Indian should be ashamed of themselves for following the slave drive and Democrat that are truly racist and killed them off
1,Well there you have it folks. leftist political correctness is a mental condition.

Like the FBI who have never started or done an investigation of why over 26 individuals that were set to testify against Hilary were suddenly found DEAD. *5 of them died the night before they were to appear to testify. Nothing done. If she can get away with that then EMAILS are a JOKE to her and she is sitting and laughing, as the *Deep State continues to rule our lives whether we like it or not."

That have got to be the most outlier in the History of Polling

Rasmussen have Trump leading Biden with Black Voters by a 54% to 45% OMG

They have Trump beating Biden with Minority voters 50% to 49%.

No Republican in History have ever gotten 50% of the Minority vote.

Democrats always get 90% of the Black vote so you know Rasmussen is full of it

Rasmussen had Trump beating Biden by 3pts in 2020. Give me a break"
1,The people of California had their chance. Choice was made. It’s a shame.
1,"It’s funny you Trumptards are always crying about “liberal” states but Liberals never mention dirt poor red state, states like Oklahoma or Alabama, unless it’s about abortion rights 😆.

1,Israel can pay for that themself they have national Heath care they not need to pay anything at the hospital That 3 billions can be used to help Americans
1,Israel is our only freedom loving ally in the Mideast. Why Jews in the US vote for Dems. has always been a mystery to me.
1,They are insane. But the Democrat Jews still vote Democratic?
1,"They are evil people, how the hell are they in our congress!??? AmericN voters better wake up and pay attention!"
1,Not only for Israel the Iron Dome missile defense system is about the only system that could have protected US troops from Iran ballistic missiles but we didn't use it (or the Patriots). Iron Dome is co-developed by the US.
1,Twitter and Facebook support for far left ideologies is failing. As I said before Mark and Jack: you are not kings of the Internet. USA supports Israel. And Iron Dome will be funded. Tatiana

1,"Look at the ""America first"" crowd crying because we stopped giving Israel money 🤣🤣🤣"
1,Their actions are malicious at best.
1,I find it hard to believe the nation of Israel doesn’t have the money to maintain their Iron Dome. I thought the Jewish people were known for being bankers. Does America not have enough debt?
1,I support Israel and get these anti American politicians out
1,GOD will take care of these idiots!
1,"In the end more Palestinians will die when Israel bombs them for sending rockets into Israel and there is no way to stop the rockets.
Rashid and Omar are dumber than a rock"

Don't you understand and know you will have more Muslim Senators to Armour embargo and Financial sanctions for Israelis and Americans will be losing the freedom of speech so or later."
1,Why do we have to pay for this? Why cant Isreal spend their own money? They seem to have enought to pay for all their residence college and heathcare.
1,Thank the anti American democrats for the anti American squad !!!
1,Biden is doing the devils work! It’s a sad time in America and I pray that the lord stops all of it!
1,Why are these anti Americans given so much power???!!!
1,Did biden just meet with Israel and promised to keep the program going. Everything this administration has said they would do has been just the opposite of those promises
1,"Yeah but that kind of money, is same as possessing it ,which we don't want ....... as usual islam attacks 1cause of poverty ,pollution, rapes,drugs etc."
1,It is sad so sad. They are using their religious beliefs to cloud their judgment
1,The democrat party have lost their way!
1,"These 4 Hags should be removed from government, and exported to the middle east."
1,"The elites are segregating allied nations… they’re preparing to bring America down. Weakening us by turning us weak, sexually confused, unarmed, sick, broke and broken. Meanwhile, China is getting stronger"
1,"Well, 🤷🏻‍♂️, that’s what Democrats wanted, to screw-over Israel 🇮🇱 😪 - even Schumer.. supported the anti-Israeli Squad"
1,She needs to go along with the rest of the hateful squad. Such hateful misfits and malcontents!
1,"The Democrats who are loyal to the USA, should not let their party be led by extemists who belong to organisations that want to destroy America. They should very well know who are the enemies."

1,These Anti-Americans need removed. But that’s what happens when you settle refugees to turn an election.
1,"""Liberals, progressives, Democrats and other rational thinkers must accept one crucial reality if they are to save America's democracy: Those who live in the right-wing echo chamber really do believe what they are being told. Those beliefs are now extensions of their core identities...

And as anyone who's watched Fox knows, its fundamental message is rage at what liberals are doing to our country. Over the years the specific message has changed with the times — from terrorism to open borders to Benghazi to Christian cake bakers to critical race theory — but it's always about what liberal politicians are doing to cripple America, usually with a large dose of thinly veiled racism to give it emotional heft...

The Fox pipeline is pretty simple. Fox News stokes a constant sense of outrage among its base of viewers, largely by highlighting narratives of white resentment and threats to Christianity. This in turn forces Republican politicians to follow suit. It's a positive feedback loop that has no obvious braking system, and it's already radicalized the conservative base so much that most Republicans literally believe that elections are being stolen and democracy is all but dead if they don't take extreme action."" - Unknown"
1,Far left lunatics 😂🤡😂🤡🖕🏻
1,"how these ""people"" got elected..I may never understand!! oh wait, maybe the same way Sleepy Joe did.. hmm that's an interesting theory..."
1,"The jihadi snakes that hijacked the democratic party hate to see Israel defending themselves. During the last cycle of violence between Israel and Hamas, the jihadi terror organization had launched over 4000 UNGUIDED rockets on Israeli cities. Thankfully, the iron dome has prevented a total holocaust against the little Jewish state. In the next war, without the defense of iron dome Israel will be forced to take it's gloves off and respond propotionally to the threat in order to win the war and ensure the safety of it's people"

1,"If the Republicans don’t do something about these traitor squad members, this country will be gone to their craziness. WHY isn’t ANYONE doing something to stop these crazy, unAmerican terrorists???"
1,American Jews could stop this but instead they support Democrats over 80% of the time. Are American Jews over the mother land? Do they agree with the squad that Israel should be wiped off the map?
1,Dems are like WWII Nazi SS muslins death Squads.
1,If there is no Iron Dome. Let Israel wipe them out on their next attack. No more attacks!
1,They are all disgusting and anti Israel they are our ally.
1,These democratic party servants are sick
1,These women do not even try to hide their anti-Semitism. It is absolutely disgusting. They should not allowed to hold office.
1,"So just finding out, the USA gives 1 BILLION to Israel 🇮🇱 for the Military Defense... While, the Government TAXES for Americans is to High...!!!"
1,If America left Germany alone we wouldn't have to worry about this now would we
1,And your point is Robbie? You do know that under the Obama administration there was a 19 trillion dollar debt added. So if we break that down to a four year term they added 9.5 trillion in four years
1,"Why the hell don’t people learn that when the Cons are not in power, they bitch and moan till the cows come home about the debt, but when they are in power, they spend like drunken sailors.
They cannot say that there isn’t enough money, because the US prints it’s own damn money! If they run low, just print more!"

1,The body of that baby has a right to live not be murdered. It was your choice to prevent getting pregnant. You also have options for adoption as well.
1,Let Gavin pay for it. He and the democrats have mismanaged the forest for years. They NEED to burn occasionally.
1,"Landlords and property owners need money too.

Giving away everything isn’t going to solve anything.

RESIGN and RETIRE Dianne Feinstein !!!"
1,So much medically has changed. Follow the science. The life of a human baby should trump as women’s choice to kill the life living inside her. So tired of women using abortion as birth control.
1,Democrats are mostly lawyers. Stealing from the rich is their business not the government .
1,So why did Gov. Newsom divert money intended for Forrest management for something else? And why hasn't he addressed the water needs of the state? He doesn't know how to prepare ahead of time for these crisis.
1,"No one FORCES an ABORTION...but YOU want to FORCE a vaccine? My body, MY CHOICE...or isn't it!! Sit Down!!"
1,Vote her the hell out. She’s a “turncoat” Democrat anyway. Now we find out that she’s “on the take” too.
1,"Then allow our right to choose a vaxclne or not.

You can’t have it both ways.

No poison for me, thank you anyways."

1,"Senator Feinstein, I am a California resident. New scientific information about the Vaccine being highly fatal has emerged. Please forward the attached information to the"
1,50 years ago we thought it was a blob. We know better now. It is inhumane butchery to abort a living feeling person that literally tries to get away from the blade. This is indefensible now that we know.
1,Obama received millions from healthcare giants and drug companies. Where was the outrage back then?
1,"Our country is falling apart. The border is a HUGE BREACH. Why is the Government allowing ILLEGALS for all over the world into our COUNTRY ILLEGALLY??? Your break our IMMIGRATION laws, and YOU DO NOTHING??? All democrats are Communists now. Where’s the SAFETY and SECURITY for WE THE PEOPLE? We ARE NOT REPRESENTED in our OWN CONTRY! This is UNCONSTITUTIONA

So I decided to INVADE and INTERRUPT this current string topic.Here's Gianna Jessen, (link) a rare survivor of this moral ABOMINATION that your senator championed when voting AGAINST Senate Bill 311: If it had passed, it would have protected the sometimes FULL-TERM survivors of infanticide abortions; abortions which are done WITHOUT anesthesia for the infant. If you read your senator's FB page, then you need to know about/"
1,Lol at democrats concerned over the debt
1,Because Democrats are massive rich and hypocrites...
1,What science or evidence is Biden using to know there’s an invisible man in the sky?
1,"Learn to swallow. Prevent conception...do
n't kill babies"
1,WHY can't Democrats EVER fight as hard for America as they do trying to kill unborn human babies?
1,"Raising the debt limit authorizes Treasury (or is it the Federal Reserve Bank? hell if I know) to run the dollar bill printing press an hour more. If Democrats were serious about defending the dollar (and they ain't even serious about defending the cost of tea in China), they'd be cutting income tax rates (causing money to move out of tax-shelters) and taxing the royal dickens out of crude oil instead."
1,The right to bear arms was decided during the founding of this great country and Democrats still wanna change that.
1,"Many are bought-and-paid
-for too., and the Democratic party is just weak and spineless; sickening."
1,"I would prefer my doctor to decide which drug I need to take, and not the government"
1,Sorry but we don't need another lying communist rag.
1,This is the politics of preserving electoral re-election for political expediency at the expense of killing unborn children!
1,Funny how My Body My Choice was such a solid rock foundation that we could all bank on until you allowed it to be undermined with forced vaccines. You have done this to all of us.
1,This is inhumane to kill a living human no matter what size it is.
1,Why Democrats? Why?
1,"Why is it greed to keep what you've earned? Why isn't it greed to take from someone beyond what is taxable. If you want to say that people cheat the government out of taxes ask yourself; who creates loopholes in the tax code?
Term Limits for Congress!"
1,If you're suspending rent payments are you also suspending the taxes of property owners? (Why do America hating Democrats screw-up everything they touch?)
1,Giving away taxpayer dollars that we don't have. Fiscally stupid. DemocaRats took away our right to work. Treason.
1,Time to drain the Democrat's swamp.
1,So they can be sold alive to planned parenthood? Obama started that. Trump stopped it. Biden started it again.
1,I guess… collectively they would still be a more resource rich country with a higher GDP than most countries in the world including in Europe because of Texas and Florida
1,When does a fetus gain its constitutional rights?
1,"Alright, logical fallacies in your statement aside, the idea that all white people bear responsibility is, in and of itself, racist.  You're trying to assign blame to an entire racial group. 

Getting past that, focusing on blame when trying to solve a problem is not constructive.  What's important is that we all agree there's a problem, and work towards correcting it."
1,"He's right though,  saying white people have blood on their hands because  the actions of people in the past or some people in the present is as racist as assuming black people as a group are responsible for the few black people who commit a disproportionate amount of violent crime, or blaming men for the few who commit a disproportionate amount of rape.

And white privilege  might exist, but the overly simplified heuristic that is used when discussing white privilege deeply flawed. One can't assume that just because  someone is white, they are automatically  privileged. There are so many many variables involved that may increase, decrease, or nullify any actual  privilege that just talking about it in such broad terms of all white people compared to all minorities as privileged or oppressed is completely useless and ultimately causes more conflict than help resolve anything."
1,Isn’t the far left a literal accused rapist himself and the bitch next to him was literally a handmaiden to a cult. This is crazy.
1,Why do you think that is? Personally I think it’s because the Democratic Party here is designed to be nothing more than controlled opposition
1,Yes no exceptions for rape and incest
1,"I doubt if that pains you otherwise you wouldn't have brought it up. Does it pain you that the African-American community was split on Clarence Thomas with men supporting him and women supporting her? Or that other Democrats voted to confirm Thomas?

Of course not. Your goal was to smear the POTUS."
1,So Democrats are on board with Christo-fascism or is this about the so-called ‘moderates’ and independents? I say fck ‘em. This shit is dead serious. They get re-elected to a fascist country that’s about to do away with elections? Seems like a shortsighted take.
1,"Democrats are, collectively, wimps. We hardly ever push back in any meaningful way."
1,Also says the right of the people to keep and bear arms.
1,I have. It's my right to keep and bear arms. Don't like guns? Don't buy one! Don't like abortion? Don't get one! Don't like gay marriage? Marry the opposite sex! Problems solved!

1,So the takeaway is don't have an opinion unless it lines up with the crooked left Nazi Germany.
1,"At this point there can't be any reconciliation. The left wants things inherently un American, has a serious lack of morals, and revels in destruction and indoctrination.  Read any subs here about politics or anything for that matter, and Twitter, and see how truly vile the left is. They aren't liberals anymore. They're leftists."
1,That’s terrible I swear these leftist and huge companies are afraid of a issue that shouldn’t be in question. Snowflakes at the finest. Smh
1,Baby killing seems so important to a part of our society
1,"Remember when almost everyone condemned abortion and being pro-life wasn't controversial. I was called ""edgy"" for supporting this man. No I just didn't throw away my moral compass and still understand the difference between right and wrong. 
  When you're championing the murder of innocents as a sacred right and so happy satanist are trying to protect your cause you might want to try and find that compass.."
1,"So this is how the left wants us to be - silent or support their views.    That’s how we end up prisoners who are afraid to speak.  
Sounds like Marxism etc.  
we need to grow some gonads."
1,"Exactly, try speaking the truth about anything on the Democrats Sub here and see what happens"
1,The left is happy for you to voice an opinion - as long as it is theirs.
1,More like communist
1,"No it doesn't. Nor does it have to have ""exceptions for life of the mother"" either. The latter is the only possibly compelling exception and even then it falls flat on its face because in no other realm is failure to medically save (in this case the baby) applicable to murder. 

You cannot fail to save with malice aforethought and despite taking every reasonable action still murder the person. That's just nonsense because the malice aforethought part is contradictory to the actions trying to save another. Doctors aren't perfect and fail to save people all the time and it's not murder. So why would it be any different for the unborn child that you suggest abortion be legal so that they can be killed? It doesn't make sense. Either the child is going to die regardless what you do and you can save the mother, or the child lives and the mother lives.

So no, the law doesn't need to make any exceptions for this. If you murder the child, you should be punished. Period."
1,"I agree, but it's incredibly frustrating that if you hold liberal views you're free (and even sometimes rewarded) for being as loud about them as possible.

Company leaders (who inherently represent all working under them) should keep political opinions to themselves regardless of where they fall on the political spectrum, but that condition is currently only half true."
1,So its better that kids be murdered than orphaned? Thats kinda warped..
1,"Nope, it means we don't believe the federal government should get involved and that it should be legislated (or not) by the state.

Learn things."
1,"It's clear you're not a Republican so you can be on your way, now."
1,You don't need to be religious to believe a fetus is a human being.... wtf lol
1,"Ha it doesnt even need to be a political sub. It could be... About puppy dogs. Someone makes a political comment on a picture of a husky puppy that is related to democratic ideology. You answer with your conervative ideology, you get banned.

I remember getting banned from my hometowns subreddit for a situation like this."
1,"Is there a difference?

Communism, nazism, and fascism are all sister movements of the same leftist socialist ideology."
1,"No one is trying to restrict their bodies. We care about the living, unborn babies inside."
1,I mean c-section is very possible and scary stretch marks would get covered therapy would get covered I’m sorry about it but life is life. Every life should have a dying chance. Or a chance in general. The next bill gates. The next Candace Owens. The next Ron Desantis. Would you like to further more explain why you feel this way?
1,"That's because it doesn't actually have to. Failing to save an unborn baby because we're unable to do so is not abortion. That's a miscarriage, even if facilitated by surgery to remove the child from a fallopian tube. The child is guaranteed to die in that case and so it's not murder to save the mother's life by removing the child whole from the mother and allowing that to happen without killing the mother."
1,actually. Nazism isnt a movement. Facist is far right. The only one that is left is communism. Trust me thos f***ing libtards destroy you if you get the facts wrong. I learned the hard way.
1,"That is an interesting question and I think you are seeing the statements that conservatives typically make regarding individual liberty (i should be able to make my own decisions because I am free to do so, I just have to deal with the consequences of that decision) and relating it to this issue. Is that the case? I'm sorry if it isn't, that's just the connection that I see and would appreciate clarification if I'm incorrect. 
I think the distinction is that we regard the pregnant woman and the unborn baby as individuals with inherent value simply because they are human. That idea has ramifications. We believe both of those individuals have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. So because the baby is a living individual, it has a right to life and should be provided that as much as we are able. Additionally, the destruction of a life, which we would say begins at conception, at the hands of another is murder, which is something we believe is wrong.
I hope this helps. If you have any more questions or would like to discuss things more, feel free to dm me. I know I'm not always the best at clearly articulating my view, so I would be glad to discuss it further."
1,"Thank you for your questions. As before I think those are important questions to ask especially since they can have a big impact on the lives of people involved. 
Would you expand on what sex education would look like? I think I would agree that sex education is important. I don't always agree with how it is put into practice (for example I live in a state that begins sex education in kindergarten. In my opinion that is far too early to begin discussing that topic). So if you clarify what you would desire in that regard, I could give you my opinion in that area. 
In regards to your point on abstinence verses other options, my personal belief is that sex is something reserved for marriage. In holding that view, I acknowledge that others do not hold that view. So I would hold abstinence as the ideal. That's what I believe people should do, but since they aren't going to, providing instruction in the other areas would be beneficial, but I would still emphasize the ideal. I don't believe contraceptives are wrong, I just don't think they are best before marriage. 
I think another reason abstinence is promoted over the other options is that no matter how effective the other options are, there is still a chance that it doesn't work, while with abstinence, it should be entirely effective because if you don't participate in the act that gets you pregnant, you can't get pregnant. Actions have consequences, if you do not want to be pregnant or to deal with a child, the most effective way to prevent that is to avoid participating in the activity that results in pregnancy. If you participate in that activity, you risk the result. 
I don't know that this specifically answers your questing, but one objection I personally would have to welfare being used as a solution is I don't believe it is the government's job to take care of children whose parents would struggle to provide for them. Instead I would say it is the responsibility of the people in that community to come alongside that mother and assist her in the provision and raising of that child. One of the ways this manifests is through charity like Pregnancy Resource Center and individuals seeing the need of that mother and child. 
If a person is truly holding to the pro-life view, they must continue to value the life of that child after they are born and so must be willing to do what it takes to protect that life. The child doesn't cease to be valuable as a human just because they have left the protection of their mother's womb. 
As before I hope I was helpful. If you have any questions or would like clarification, you are welcome to dm me. Thank you for your time."
1,"You can't murder a frog because a frog is not a human being. Unborn children are unquestionably human. 

You're deflecting through equivocation because you have no answer. Answer me or expose yourself as a zealot. Upon what moral basis do we punish ANY crime?"

1,"Apparently, only the left is allowed to be racists. They are attacking Larry Elder constantly. We need to fight back against leftist racism."
1,"These kinds of statistics will soon be scrubbed from the internet. I’m already noticing this in many aspects. Not only will they scrub the historical crime data, governments that have succumbed to identity politics will simply stop tabulating data on criminality altogether... Well, they’ll obviously still calculate the criminality of white individuals because we are the biggest threat to western civilization, (obviously). - I still cannot believe that the President, and one of the most powerful department of defense employees said that fucking bullshit. Sorry for the tangent"

1,Fauci was a driving force and had significant input into funding the Wuhan lab...that's why he was soo protective when the virus was released....he's sketchy as hell...why is the US funding a research lab in Wuhan?  China has plenty of money!...is it because Wuhan wouldn't have the oversight/ regulations/ scrutiny that a lab in the US or other free society country would have?
1,Biden is a pos
1,Just say it's art like these liberal idiots do then you can't get in trouble
1,We have no freedom of speech anymore.
1,"He has no business violating military law and then acting like a victim. He knows the rules, he should have kept his mouth shut."
1,Biden’s an asshole but he’s not that stupid …
1,"Nope

""Prior to the UCMJ creation in the 1950's, this particular rule was required by military officers even before America was officially a country.""

The Deep State must have been plotting this for a long damn while. The commies were planning this before America even existed 😬"
1,Yeh well sometimes you have to speak your peace.  Fuck political correctness when 13 are dead and biden is a fuck up !
1,"Quite clear you didn’t do military service. 

You complete a mental health exam EVERY year, so don’t buy into he had one because he criticized the president. He completed one because he was required to complete his annual. 

Joe Biden blatantly put marines in danger, despite an abundance of military intelligence without a single doubt telling him exactly what is going to happen months before the Taliban even took Kabul. 

He blatantly disregarded intelligence, armed the Taliban to the teeth so when we inevitably go in next it will be a slaughter, and made one of the worst military decisions possibly any president has made. 

We abandoned our allies, are openly being disrespected across the world, and made this world a lot more dangerous of a place because of his immaturity. 

Or are we going to talk about the blatant disrespect for every dead service member brought home according to a barrage of witnesses’ and gold star families?  

This president is effectively the sole reason for tens of thousands of deaths and ensured many more to come in the future. 

Calling out this administration for the blatant disregard for human life is only right, if he faces jail time so be it, he did the right thing.

The military may not be a “democracy”, but having completely arrogant and disastrous leadership that directly leads to the death of the men you swore to protect under your command, you morally have a right to say something."
1,"No, Bidens approval rating is among the worst of any President in history, and it's because of Afganistan.  Gas prices are doubled. Inflation the highest its been in 40 years. Still millions of Americans out of work because our economy is shit. Democrats extended unemployment way too long and paid bonuses to people too lazy to look for a job. Many businesses closed because they couldn't find workers. 
 So you're full of crap if you think a majority support attacking an honest General that told the truth about Afganistan. Even the deep state leaked Bidens phone call with the Afganistan president asking him to lie about the Taliban having power."
1,It's not political correctness. It military law to maintain order and discipline.
1,"...and when you violate the UCMJ to do so, there can be consequences (unless you are a leftist)."
1,"What happened to the military officers like Alexander Vindman who not only criticized Trump, he lied under oath for a phony impeachment? He filed a false whistle-blower complaint claiming he heard the Ukraine phone call. He didn't. An Obama holdover Eric Ciara-mella heard the call and used Alexander Vindman as a phony witness. No charges were  given to Vindman even after he was caught lying."
1,"Correct.  What immoral or unethical order was Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller given, that he had a duty to disobey?

Contrary to leftist belief, *not liking* the President or senior officers does not grant military personnel carte blanche to disobey their lawful orders or act disrespectfully toward them."
1,"There is no legal path to overthrow the government.

There is a constitutional system to create laws, judge them and amend the constitution. You should know that as a ""constitutional conservative"".

You advocate something else it's called sedition or treason against our constitutional republic. They make tall trees and short prices of rope for them folks."
1,"> No, abandoning our people and actively arming a terrorists organization is plenty of ammunition to question what the hell is going on.

It absolutely is.  However, those don't relate to orders Lt. Colonel Scheller was given.

His first video was a violation of Article 88 of the UCMJ.  His second video was a violation of that, and arguably Article 94 also, because it included the statement  ""Follow me, and we will bring the whole [expletive] system down"".  The possible penalties for violation of Article 88 are dismissal, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for one year.  Article 94 has the potential to carry a death penalty.

Biden and the senior officers under his command did a lot of bad things, and they should all spend time in prison.  ...but what Scheller did was dumb."

1,"Biden and Democrats want to believe their lies that everything went okay that they are going to leave Americans to die there. If they helped then it would be acknowledging they messed everything up. 

Democrats strategy appears to be just parrot the propaganda for months and hope people believe your shi$t doesn't stink if you do it long enough."
1,It's possible that all of this was intentional. What if the Americans left behind were Biden's enemies. Biden hands the Taliban their name and addresses and let's the Taliban do his dirty work for him. His enemies are dead. Problem solved. He will take a hit in the polls early on in his administration in the hopes that by 2024 it's all forgotten.

1,Newsom is garbage take out the trash before it sits there and smell worst .
1,Tyt might be the most racist so called news ever. The Democrats are the founders and promoters of the kkk do they not know history?
1,"Yes, Reparations. Taking money from people who never owned slaves and giving it to people who never were slaves. 
What about white americans from the north whose ancestor probably died fighting to free the slaves? Or black people today whose ancestor's owned slaves? Or what about mixed racial people - would a black person with a white slave owner ancestor have to pay? What about a white person with a black slave ancestor, would they receive money? 
The rabbit hole of reparations makes no sense and is widely open for abuse and perpetuating resentment that should have died decades ago. That's Elders point. You're either too stupid to understand that or are deliberately misrepresenting him so you can smear him."
1,You leftists are completely racist and he never said that slave owners should get reparations. Larry elder was attacked in a gorilla mask by leftist and people like you support it. You never cared about black lives and hate black people who think for ourselves Leftists are the biggest racist.
1,"A conversation about the optics of this,  I think is wrong. The Taliban maybe bad but there is nothing in this clip which is I haven't seen on or advocated on US TV. It's their right to bear arms, they weren't pointing their guns at the anchor so I don't see the problem. If like me they have been watching US TV over the last few years they would believe it'll be foolish not to have a gun on them at any point"
1,These so-called journalists in America should look at this and see what they are actually doing while these American journalist sit here and almost defend these people it's sickening to see what the news media and turned into they are the press for the Democrat Party there is no longer any biased news outlets

BUNCH OF SORRY LOSERS IN LIFE.....GET A REAL JOB CHIEF"
1,he's not even wearing a real badge but of course it's CNN so they couldn't find a real cop
1,"If this Police Chief cannot maintain control in his area, he needs to find another job. All his ass is doing is getting his 5 minutes of fame for badmouthing the President! Oh, from Houston...another Liberal city!"
1,"Well to the police chief on behalf of me as one of the people if you would do less interviews on the news and more of your job maybe BLM wouldn't be ravaging the streets burning down communities! 
Ps

You’re so afraid of republicans because they all have a huge arsenal of weapons and ammo (at least that’s what you’ve been saying to push the banning of weapons.) 🤔 Yet, they didn’t bring any weapons to the “insurrection???”  You have to be very stupid to believe these leftists propagandists."
1,CNN blows
1,"Do you know who attended the rally? Undercover agents and media, like the one who was arrested by the capitol police. But you will never report that arrest. Trump supporters didn't take your bait and didn't attend the event. You failed miserably"
1,CNN reports BLM protests mostly peaceful while standing in front of a burning building.  You have to be an idiot to believe this propaganda machine of lies
1,CNN the network of lies to cause division 👏👏and the CNN  brainwashed followers who don't know how to think for themselves
1,It appears that the prisoners are political prisoners and are being treated this way simply because their misdirected passions supported former president Trump. The real violent insurrectionists were the ANTIFA and BLM rioters that terrorized communities across the country! Where’s the prisons holding BLM vandals in solitary confinement and denying them basic legal rights?
1,I bet the liberal media was just hoping for fighting and arrests.  Good news=NO NEWS with most media.
1,Boo CNN boo the home of fake Fu ing news!!!!!
1,"cnn trying really hard to stay relevant. This is not news, it’s all propaganda and the emotionally unstable are eating this up. Poor things."
1,"Dear News Media:

He included:""I WILL WALK WITH YOU""(what?)

1,"You guys realize the Clinton's, Obama's and Biden's are all above the law, right. It is foolish to expect them to comply with the laws passed for us little people. The last 4 year have proven that our Justice System is so corrupt that some families are in fact, above the law."
1,"What president, surly it's not this mealy mouthed president that is in office now! Does he not know that they will get mad at him. Lol"
1,"FBI is hiding the Anthony Weiner laptop and the Hunter Biden laptop. They are obstructing Justice, and helping the criminals beat the law. Crime does Pay if your on the Democratic side."

1,Come down to Florida where you will be employed and respected and protected under Governor DeSantis!!!  Thank you for your service sir!!
1,Biden setting the stage for country to be invaded by foreign UN sponsored military by having our military quit.   He should be removed from office
1,All these idiots that are putting these untested drugs in their bodies are going to regret it.
1,"Even if ur not religious, u hafta respect this man’s strength of character and principles. He’s made quite a large sacrifice, n my estimation, to stand up for what he believes n. And that n and of itself is worthy of respect."
1,"This is how they remove people that MAY be conservative or republican from their jobs because let’s face it it’s the opinion of the leftists and dems that only trump supporters and republicans are against this vaccine which really isn’t true, people across the board are against the vaccine mandate not necessarily the vaccine. I’m a part time Uber and Lyft driver and today while working I met a woman who lost some of her sight and became partially paralyzed a couple days after taking the second dose of the vaccine and her doctor admitted it was almost certainly from the vaccine but these doctors aren’t reporting these cases so there really is legitimacy to peoples concerns about this vaccine and the government and businesses shouldn’t be putting mandates in place that essentially force people to get vaccinated or lose their jobs."
1,"God bless you, Sgt. Gutierrez, and thank you for your service to our nation!"
1,He lived in nutty California what did he expect?!  Proud of him for doing this.

1,"They are pushing the best out of the military and police department.  
Biden should be arrested for treason , I 100% believe he and CONGRESS LEFT AND RIGHT are willfully causing this country to collaps.  

Our best pilots are quiting , Navy seals and other people who are red blooded Americans ....

This nation is in danger ."
1,This man is my hero! I too will not get the vax! I support him 100%!
1,"As much as I applaud these polices officers and military personnel, and support them fully, it scares me that more and more are quitting. Soon we will have nothing but leftist snowflakes left in law enforcement and our military."

1,America’s going down we need to get it back.
1,"Ppl are waiting all over America for best moment to try to enter the country. There will be wave after wave. Most are decent folk, but many are criminals fleeing their own country and those that truly hate us can take this opportunity to get in & REALLY hurt us."
1,"What does that sign in the thumbnail say?   Oh, we will vote democrat, of course.   And who is organizing and handing out tshirts?  What organizing?   How did a bunch of non typical immigrants from MULTIPLE African countries all decide to come at the same time?"

You would lose your job because there would be ""new"" citizens that would do your job much better and for much lower wages."

Government does not belong in our schools ."
1,It doesn't matter any more no country in history ever survived massave influx of migrants
1,It sounds like they're teaching them TO BE RACISTS.  There isn't any actual racism to teach them about.
1,Keep this fight alive. Don't let the far left media burry this.
1,"Democrats the party of racism, Covid, crime and treason."
1,"I believe nancy and obama are controlling biden and harris and taking America down economically and morally into communism. Watch the video, AGENDA GRINDING America down."
1,Keep racism and marxism out of schools. Critical Race Theory IS racism. It separates white from every other color. End of argument.
1,Stop sending your kids to these public schools of leftist indoctrination!
1,Critical Race Theory reminds me of socialist and communist dictatorships of the past!!!
1,"85% of black people HATE white people, now that's racism..."
1,Call it what it REALLY is: Critical RACIST Theory

1,Ever notice that the idoits pushing back against CRT are the same ones pushing back against mandatory vaccinations and booster shots? It's as if the unvaccinated have a much lower IQ. At what point does the government step in to protect us and round them all up?
1,Democrats are communists
1,"CRT is not about having a ""conversation about racism"", its specifically designed to be an anti white ideology that turns white children into the ""opressor"" and the non white students into the subjugated."
1,Well at least all of the people in Virginia are not stupid.
1,"Want to solve the problem? Pull your kids out of school. They get no funding for your child, therefore less money, and you will have more intelligent children, in the end. Home school is more education that any public school ever wanted to be."
1,I recommend starting inclusive small and private schools in your communities. Read your state constitutions & know your rights! This has to stop
1,Dont. Talking about racism is what's keeping it alive.
1,Trump 20now.
1,"Too late. The Deep State and corporations will commit any crime to maintain power. USA will be destroyed by radical left ideologies and the moronization of the population, education and rewriting of history. You had a chance to change the end of your civilization, but you cowardly gave it up."
1,Easy fix Stop Voting Democrat!!!!
1,"Once again, Democrats push racism in this country, just like they did for 400 years.  Just like they did when they owned ALL the slaves.  Just like they did when they fought to preserve slavery during the Civil War.  Just like they did when they refused to sign the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments.  Just like they did when they created Jim Crow laws.  Just like they did when they tried to filibuster the Civil Rights laws from passing in 1964."
1,"We need to teach patriotism instead of racism.  Loving your country is a step foward racism is backward.
God teaches love thy neighbor!"
1,"You should see how they teach in Germany, you be scared 😨"
1,FBI= Fumbling Bungling Incompetents. They couldn't find sand in the Sahara Desert...
1,"FBI was crooked when Trump was in office and turned on him, why should anyone be surprised about their behavior."
0,"They elected a man who said he grabbed them by the p***y….yeah, we have a long way to go."
0,"And people wonder why victims don’t report right away. The response is so often that they are lying, don’t know how social interaction works, or were asking for the abuse. Can we stop allowing these powerful men to defend themselves on national television in this pathetic and manipulative way?"
0,How about trump and Gaetz and Kavanaugh? Why are they not held accountable!?
0,Thank you. The sexual violence and abuse by powerful men can no longer be ignored.
0,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unrelated I know.
I’m from the UK and haven’t heard any official speak about what’s happening with Line 3.

A treaty is currently being broken, US law enforcement paid by the Canadian oil company for man power.
The indigenous need help along with many endangered species that rely on that water."
0,"For every courageous women who refuse to be abused in silence there are multiples who still live in fear and suffering, they must feel safe to come forward, also there must be sever consequences for those who help the harasser cover up"
0,"I love this. As a fellow Democrat I'm glad he resigned but am disappointed he seemed to feel no remorse, and took no blame. We have to be the party to take the higher ground, because we know they never will."
0,"I’m in awe of how AOC (or the person who runs her account) can articulate the modern complexities of civil rights. I do wish he was around to progress the Trump cases,I’m hoping it gets done with the same fortitude."
0,"Thank you AOC, for helping blow the dust and cobwebs off institutions of power that have operated in the shadows for too long. Your courage is contagious and very much needed right now. ❤️"
0,"I agree with everything you said. But I am getting tired of the Dems always being the ones to stand up and take their own out for this type of BS behavior, while the GOP ignore it and let it continue and refuse to do the same with their own. We need to force them to do the same!"
0,AOC is my dream girl. She's so perfectly Beautiful ❤️ As far as the politics. You go girl.
0,It is always right to criticize law enforcement in the United States. People think it's a crime -- especially after -- but it's a right.
0,"I heard a report today that none of the Brooklyn Center police force actually live in the community. If this is true, this is also a problem. A community's police department should reflect the community in which they protect and serve. This won't solve everything, but if the police are of the people of their community, they may have a different level of investment in its people. And more good police need to call out bad police."
0,"Excuse me for saying so, but it seems a bit odd that a woman who has been a police officer for 26yrs would 'mistakenly' draw her gun thinking it was her taser, if she doesn't know the difference between the two after 26yrs then she shouldn't be a cop at all and she sure as hell shouldn't be excused, or forgiven, for making such a stupid, not to mention fatal, rookie mistake..."
0,"The reason the cops pulled Daunte Wright over: He had an air freshener dangling from his mirror which was supposedly blocking his view.

I feel like that part of the story doesn’t get enough attention. Really makes you wonder if they were just looking for a reason to pull people over."
0,"Let’s not forget the mass proliferation of guns among USA citizens...so that police fear being killed with every racially profiled pull over. You can thank the misinterpretati
on of the second amendment and the NRA for that."
0,Bernie is not radical. He's just a honest to god democrat. The corporate lobbies just hate the truth. What made america great was a strong middle class not a handful of billionaires. Reasonable people need to vote. Not just the clowns.

TooFarLeft
Education is a good investment from an individual, family, community or national perspective and tuition free education will reduce the burden from the root on our medical expenses too for example.

Healthcare for all is actually CHEAPER with the insurance industry off of the table along with most of the time lost due to billing among many other reasons.

A universal basic income (UBI) is CHEAPER than all of the thousands of individual federal, state and local social safety net programs including things like Social Security and unemployment insurance, etc with all of their budgets, overhead expenses and inefficiencies eliminating the humiliating need for people to lose time to prove their poverty to qualify for aid.

Internet for all is a great and necessary investment to give everyone the opportunity to study, search for work, work remotely, etc online.

Solar power is CHEAPER and electric vehicles are soon to be CHEAPER to make and already are considerably CHEAPER to maintain and operate, especially if charged from your own solar power.

What do you think will happen to crime rates, peace and equality in general after we launch universal healthcare, a universal basic income, universal education and internet for all, raising the starting point of capitalism from zero, we’ll let you die with no money, to a level of life with dignity, reducing societal daily fears on a massive scale and freeing us to welcome the automation revolution with open arms rather than with fear and great harm? 😃 EqualityMovemen

They’re going to be much stronger going into the actual gubernatorial election in 2022 than they would have if they didn’t do this recall. That’s the point of the recall. To give them another campaigning and fundraising season before the election next year. 

Normally we wouldn’t be talking about who the Republican candidates are for governor this far out from the election, but because of the recall, these guys are household names now. They’ve already won at what they were trying to do. Hopefully it doesn’t win them the office of governor in ‘22"

So we’re likely going to see a head to head battle between him and elder next year.

0,"I told a friend about it today. They said they weren't going to vote but decided to vote when I explained to them what was at stake. In fact, they threw their ballot in the trash and had to dig it out! 

I'm glad they voted, but our fellow democrats need to be a little more active. Hell, the democratic messaging needs to change to and stress the urgency here."
0,"In California, a recall election can be put into motion solely by getting a petition signed by a proportion of state citizens equal to or greater than 12% of the number of voters in the previous office election. As such, to force a recall election of Gavin Newsom--who won with 62% of the vote in 2018--only required 1.4 million signatures, or 3.5% of California's population. The recall is costing California $276 million and represents an attempted power grab by Republicans to take advantage of a non-regular election to unseat the democratically-elected governor.

According to the law, the recall is based on two questions: question one is a yes or no question about recalling Gavin Newsom, and question two is who would replace him were the yes vote to receive a plurality of the vote. So, technically, 3.5% of the population forces the other 96.5% to turn out in an irregular election to vote ""no"" by a plurality, or the most popular ""other"" candidate running (currently Republican Larry Elder with about 26% popularity) becomes governor. If a plurality votes ""yes,"" regardless of who they prefer, a candidate with less than 30% popularity can supplant the governor elected with over twice that popularity during a standard, regular election."
0,You're on a democratic party sub mate... I don't think anyone here will be influenced very heavily by this...
0,"The reason they got 12% of voters to sign is because Covid extended their time to get signatures by 3 months. So they simultaneously bitch about Covid measures and owe it to Covid measures that they got a recall at all. 

12% of voters shouldn't be able to waste the time of the other 88% with this bullshit."
0,"You are amazing for doing this. Is there anyone else you can call? You seem to be a trusted voice of reason. 

&x200B;

This also reminds me of Nov. 4th. I had to call my aunt the day before to ask her if she is voting. She wasn't going to because my cousin (her daughter) always goes with her but had to work. I told her I'll stay on the phone with her while she waits in line, thank goodness I was working from home halfway across the country. So I listened to her random stories for an hour after calling 3 times to get her out of the house to the polls and sending her the polling location. 

She lives in NV so it was 100% worth the effort to get another vote for Biden. Then i convinced my exhausted cousin to stop at her polling place after pulling a double at work. +2 votes for Biden in NV! 

Seeing how close NV was warmed my heart for my little cross country voter outreach."

0,"Those Govenors bear some responsibility.

We cannot blame the Federal government, we blame the 70 million selfish rural Trumpers who refuse to get vaccinated and shed the virus to innocents. Now the kids are dying.

This is squarely the fault of self-centered conservatives who back the big lie. Now they are in the hospital begging for help.

They should be shamed off the planet and Republicans must all be beaten in 2022."
0,"Vaccines for kids, yes. Boosters for immune compromised, the elderly etc, yes. But beyond that, we really need to start sending hundreds of millions of doses overseas.

I didn’t hear talks of debt ceiling from republicans when Trump drove the economy to the ground with a mega deficit. Another laughable republican economic plan is their so-called “trickle down economy”, a Koch backed theory that the rich shouldn’t be taxed as it tends to hurt the economy. If republicans truly cared for the economy, they wouldn’t give tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations. Neither would they try to recall Newsom, whom despite the long lasting effects of the pandemic on the nation was able to balance California’s economy with a surplus."
0,I wonder if one of their motivations in passing these regressive laws is to drive out liberals and moderates from their state in an attempt to combat the possibility of changing demographics turning their states from red to purple and eventually blue.
0,"Perhaps. 

Thing is though, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin all are majority liberal cities. They get around that by the politicians picking the voters, not the voters picking the politicians.  Texas gerrymanders the hell out of districts to keep it red and there has always been complaints of election fraud that never go anywhere.  

The crew that is in charge now are corrupt AF.  Ken Paxton has been indicted for several felonies while he has been AG but he always slithers his way out. Dan Patrick used to be a big coke head and Abbott is just a cronies crony.  They have managed to completely fuck up that state."
0,Just vote no. The recall is a fascist attempt by the GQP to circumvent democracy.
0,Too small a constituency to count on...Every voter in Cali needs to wake up and tell their friends or you could wake up in two weeks with Larry Elder as your governor.
0,"I'm worried too, but for this it's not really that California Republicans are gaining momentum. It's solely because of the idiotic rules for recall elections where someone can replace a slightly unpopular governor with a tiny minority of the vote."
0,"Totally agree.  When I saw the recall effort initially, I just laughed it off as more GQP fuckery.  

I just can't believe there are really that many people in CA that are in support of this.  Really not a good thing going into the midterms."
0,"To be fair, it's really only in danger of happening in California due to their absolutely idiotic format for recall elections. Otherwise, Republicans would literally never be able to elect a governor."
0,Yeah. It's too easy to unseat a governor who is only having a slight dip in popularity or if there is a motivated minority voting in a low turnout election. Plus the way that the replacement is selected produces a new governor with nothing near a popular mandate.
0,"No. Paffrath is polling at only 10%.

Good luck holding PG&E accountable when a crazy Republican is in power in CA."
0,"Are you referring to the PG&E settlement? I'm no fan of PG&E, but forcing the largest utility in America into a punitive bankruptcy wouldn't have helped anyone. The simple truth is that PG&E took our money for years and left us with shit infrastructure and we should be enraged at that, but we can't get blood from a turnip. 

Don't retcon the reason for the recall election to be all about the PG&E settlement. The recall was started by a racist, anti-vaxx former sheriff of Yolo County, who coincidentally was just diagnosed with COVID. It is fundamentally undemocratic to allow 12% of the electorate to replace a popularly elected governor. It might be legal for now, but that doesn't make it right."
0,This is why republicans are always trying to recall the governor. It's much easier than winning an actual election.
0,It is misplaced blame.  Trump withheld federal emergency funds and his arsonist supporters lit the federal land national forest on fire in 2018. It's trump's fault.

There's no other fucking explanation for why they vote directly AGAINST their self-interest, time after time after time, year after year after year. 

Even though they're poor, their loyalty lies with millionaires, billionaires and corporations. Can you imagine being THIS psychologically manipulated?

They constantly complain about minor minimum wage increases causing inflation and higher prices for goods and services, not considering that executive salaries and shareholder profits are the actual problem. 

I'm CONSTANTLY telling people on Facebook that they're not going to pay $20 for a Big Mac if Billy Bob makes $7.45 instead of $7.25 for flipping burgers. Then I ask them if they're interested in seeing the quarterly shareholder report."

""Fear"" and ""Enemy"" are part of the Conservative mindset. As far as wealthy disparity, it started for real with Reagan and he used the flag to create the enemy. From there it's gotten more twisted. 

Ironically, the right and left DO share a common enemy. And if both sets of eyes were on the ball, things would change. Won't happen though. I think it's too deeply ingrained."
0,"This happens regularly in any other advanced economy though? UK, Australia, Norway, New Zealand etc etc. So you can do it. 

It's because Republicans have this fear of anything socialist. A fear created by the to control the few. It's to such a degree, these days ""communist"" ""Marxist"" are shouted at people with no real understanding of what those words actually mean but making sure they can wipe out any economic descent.

 they then go an vote against their own interests under fear of economic collapse cos minimum wage workers got paid an extra few dollars an hour lol. 

I worked out the other day, Jeff Bezos worth today 200bil (well few days ago) could pay all 798 000 Amazon staff himself for the next 8 years until he runs out of money.

To agree to a totally free capitalist society is to accept that this is fine. To keep going at this rate may actually collapse the economy, people will eventually revolt when the scales tip too far. When they realise we are billions and they are just the few."

When you make 40k, for example, and think that you are in the same league as Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson, you have officially become certifiable. Imo.

My interpretation is that it's just that Republicans constantly go on about how ""It was Antifa who stormed the White House, not Trump supporters!"" however whenever someone suggests creating an impartial committee to find and arrest whoever was at the White House that day, they suddenly get extremely defensive.

Bolsonaro fighting corruption? Haha You must idolatrate  him to say this nonsense. 
Even the Lava-jato operation that has put Lula in jail he fought against. Now, we  know that his whole family is involved  crimes of stealing money of their employees in the government. He also protected the guy that as asking bribes when buying vaccine."
0,"I agree, there are a lot of reasons why Bolsonaro got there in the first place. I even voted for Bolsonaro in 2018, but because I was disillusioned with the polarized reality of that time and thought he represented a drastic change and action, but as it turns out he was another right-wing populist nutjob, and I slowly began realizing it just like many americans did with Trump. You rightfully point out the Supreme Court is politically appointed, but guess who appointed a judge who freed Lula from jail? You rightfully point out corruption is rampant, but guess who is the one who destroyed the Car-Wash Operation? Yes, Bolsonaro, because turns out, he is a corrupt crook along with his entire family. In the beginning, I used to believe that ""Bolsonaro is a fascist who wants to be dictator"" was just leftist conspiracy, but the more he began actually voicing against democratic institutions, the more I realized all these speeches about ""cleaning the swamp"", or about ""saving the nation"", or about ""the corrupts within congress"" have always been far-right dogwhistles and I had fallen this conspiracy rabbithole, which I have slowly been escaping ever since the pandemic began.

So no, there's no such a thing as ""communist-inclined"" opposition against Bolsonaro, because a lot of prominent right-wing political movements such as the MBL broke off with Bolsonaro, so his opposition is pretty broad even though there are indeed left-wing people in the opposition, just like every opposition against a far-right government. No, there is no such a thing as ""Bolsonaro is for electronic plus paper ballot"", because even if he was for that, the true intention of his when voicing for this agenda is to make people distrust the system and de-stabilize democracy so he can come out as ""the man who will solve it all"", and this entire agenda of electronic plus paper ballot is another dogwhistle for ""the democratic system is bad and I want to be dictator"". Yes, there is no transparency throught society and yes Brazil is a banana republic, but the ""twist"" is that Bolsonaro himself is part of the infamous ""Centrão"" of brazilian politics, you know, the ""banana politicians"" themselves, of the rich and powerful?

To summarize: the only thing Bolsonaro ever did for Brazil is to pave the path for the gangsters of Lula to come back and continue their legacy of corruption in the name of the poor, he destroyed the legacy of the sane right-wing who only wanted to fight the corruption of Lula and the PT, and most importantly: the deaths of thousands who fell into his far-right rethoric that the ""virus doesn't exist"", or ""if it exists, China made it up"", just like what happened to many americans with Trump. So fuck Bolsonaro, fuck his far-right nutjobs and fuck his terroristic ""milicias""."
0,"Highlight of the article:

It's natural to be disappointed when we can't get everything we want, but let's keep things in perspective. With a 50-50 tie in the Senate and a mere 8 vote majority in the House, the Democrats are walking an ultrathin tight rope. Even then, they've been getting things down at a historically breakneck space.

Theres the old adage,  ""dems fall in love, Republicans fall in line"" which holds true and why we don't see th Qcult kicked to the curb (or tea party).

Yeah, it took trump to turn out the dem vote. Issue is, the ones who can and need to move the country forward at a quick step,  are millennials,  who just aren't old enough to be reliable voting bloc.

Throwing away your vote in protest almost guarantees you'll never get what you want.
0,"If you want all that, stop talking shit on Democrats and make sure they get elected.

Since that time, Virginia has legalized cannabis, raised the minimum wage, secured voting rights, expanded public healthcare, passed environmental protections, and a host of other things you no doubt value.

You know how they did it?  By having a solid majority where Democrat legislators from more conservative areas could defect on certain issues.  Republicans did NOTHING to help any of this happen, but Democrats still had the numbers because their majority is solid.

""Both sides are the same"" is the stupidest, most counterproductive thing people are saying right now, and it needs to stop.  It's not based on fact.

0,"It's ironic how republikkkans will give billions of dollars to rich, big businesses ""to help the economy"", but giving the average person money to buy goods that would actually stimulate the economy is a non-starter.

Keep people down is the only way they stay in power.

Instead of paying people's electric bills. Why not pay to have solar panels put on their house. But that takes money out of the pockets of the people giving ""OUR"" representatives money.

"
0,"Well, I think some Republicans are smart enough to realize that if they outlaw pulling life support on people who are brain dead, hospitals would be overwhelmed with care for individuals who had no chance of walking out the door again.

But Republicans have no problem telling women they need to be life support for a fetus, whether the woman chooses to or not."

They could even have talked to the Taliban online.  I think I remember that stuff being up, though I didn't look it up.  I don't want to be dumb."

0,"Well, if you know it and it's in the NYTimes, he's hardly covering it up; at least not very effectively. The Taliban probably want to be a legitimate government recognized by other governments. Of course, they will still be a traditionalist patriarchal theocracy; in other words, a Christian Dominionist and Evangelical wet dream. As the power in place, though, they are the ones that have to be dealt with."

0,"I love the fact that every time I get an email about an important issue saying: ""contact your representatives now!"" I get to just say naw, I'm good. They got this.

Smith, Klobuchar, Omar. Three fucking amazing women. Glad they represent me."
0,And voting rights. And the climate.
0,"That’s what concerns me too. If we eliminate the filibuster and the GOP grabs the majority? Texas’s law will look like child’s play compared to what could be done at the Federal Level.

Personally? I think that we should go back to the old filibuster rules(talking nonstop until the speaker wears out)."
0,"The last time republicans took over the senate, McConnell eliminated the filibuster. That’s how they confirmed all those federal judges and SCOTUS conservative judges. So yeah, Manchin and Sinema are pretty naive to believe if republicans win the senate, the filibuster will still be around."
0,It’s fun how you think McConnell isn’t going to eliminate the filibuster at the first available opportunity the moment they take control in 2022.
0,"That’s what concerns you? 

What concerns me is McConnell absolutely eliminating the filibuster just to punish Dems for talking about doing so, and everyone being all “he can’t do that” as he proceeds to do it, followed by “well nothing we can do I guess.”"
0,"If you don't get rid of the filibuster then the GOP wins the midterm elections.

Then they get rid of the filibuster.

Then they take away your right to vote"
0,"Go for it then, and end the filibuster, and then come on here crying because the GOP got a majority and used your rule against you. They didn't write the nuclear option, we did, now you crying cause they used it. They didn't break any rule, they used the rule we wrote."
0,"Again, Biden grew up in a very different era of good government and don’t expect him to change. McCain was from his era and so “were” Lindsay, Collins and Murkowski. But since Trump came in, it hasn’t been the same on the republican side of the aisle. Not that Biden isn’t doing anything wrong at all. In fact, he’s on the right side of history. We’re simply faced with a different era of bad government led by conspiracy theorists in congress and state governments with ZERO knowledge of American government and history per se."
0,"So you mad about the Republicans using a procedural rule that Democrats came up with to do something you didn't like. And using that as justification to make an even more easily abused rule because it benefits you at the moment, with no concern for the Republican abuses that are almost guaranteed.  Talk about short sighted."
0,"We’re going to have to agree to disagree. 

Maybe it’s because I’m 38, and my entire adult voting life has been watching bad government and watching the Republicans win, even when Democrats have power. 

Trump isn’t the beginning of something, he’s the culmination of decades of bad government on Republican terms. He’s the inevitable endgame of the Republican Party. 

If we can’t expect Biden to change, then we deserve to lose in 2022 and he deserves to be impeached by the Republicans in 2023. 

Historians in free countries— which won’t be ours— will look back and consider this all to be a progression, not a sudden shift from good government to bad government with the election of Trump.

The election of Trump was the natural reaction to America daring to elect a black man, and you’d better believe Republicans will burn the country to the ground before they ever see Kamala Harris in the Oval Office. 

We our on borrowed time, a narrow window, and Biden is counting on institutions to save us when they have already failed."
0,"You’re looking at the whole thing from your own simplistic point of view. You do know republicans became the party of “NO” under Obama right? They wouldn’t allow democrats to pass any bills at all. Please don’t make this about me. Unless you understand that republicans spend their entire terms in congress sabotaging democrats, this conversation is futile. Many republicans came by and went, but Gingrich, Boehner, McConnell and McCarthy have been the worst in modern history. Democrats legislate, republicans on the other hand, spend their entire time resisting democratic legislations without offering any alternatives. Pro-life and white supremacy aren’t what make the nation move forward. When was the last time republicans introduced any bills for the general welfare? Tax cuts for the wealthy?"
0,"Yeah, Moses’ Book of Numbers. I thought you were against abortion and my only point was that republicans keep throwing their anti-abortion stances out there and it’s apparently based on Christianity, yet they’re unable to prove which scriptures in the Bible ban it."
0,"In modern history and right after Gingrich, the only time republicans were this extreme was when Obama came in. No one is saying there was never any disagreements between democrats and republicans, it’s expected and as a matter of fact, it’s part of the democratic process in which the system of checks and balances is based on and compromise being the ultimate outcome. And yes, Trump did finalize the radicalism of the Republican Party that went directly after the very institutions of the federal government. That’s not disagreements, it’s anarchy, sedition and treason. I’m fully aware of the racist, anti-semitic, homophobic, Islamophobic and sexist agenda of the Republican Party to attend to its confederate base, but it didn’t amount to an insurrection on the Capitol until Trump came in."
0,"“Make a new rule, they will show you how to use it.” 

Guess the Democrats should just continue to play chess with rules according to how Republicans want them as the pigeons shit all over the chess board, then."
0,"You jumped to Obama without paying attention to my comments on Gingrich first. I can go all the back to the very beginning with the founders. Do you want to start to Thomas Jefferson? Because I’m pretty sure, the crisis we’re dealing with as of now is due to DJT and his Russian backed QAnon. BTW, I know what the fake Tea Party did. This thread simply isn’t dealing with that topic. Trump launched a failed coup d’état, that’s an attack on the entire United States government."
0,"And you’re, for some reason, just forgetting about that whole era when Republicans embraced McCarthyism, or maybe that’s just good government.

Or when the Republican Party embraced the southern strategy. 

Or when the Republican Party essentially stole the 2000 election. 


Again, the crisis we’re dealing with now did not start with Trump. 

The insurrection on the Capitol was the inevitable conclusion. 

McCain gave us Sarah Palin. 

Murkowski and Collins and Romney aren’t the good guys that are going to help us save democracy. 

There are no moderate Republicans, and haven’t been any moderate Republicans in a long time. 

We’ve had multiple opportunities to stop this crisis from unfolding, it’s just the Democratic Party, in spite of all evidence to the contrary, continued to at least pretend to believe the GOP was operating in good faith, until the insurrection happened. 

Anyways, I think we’re both basically in agreement and on the same side. 

I just think our crisis began well before Trump and the insurrection happened."
0,"It’s fun how you think the Republicans are gonna give a damn about the Constitution when they take back control in 2022.

Anyway, the filibuster wasn’t originally part of the constitution."
0,"This is so true. We consistently underestimate the ruthlessness of the GOP, and refuse to take a stand no matter how badly they abuse us."
0,"If GOP cheats and lies, then they aren't ""for America"", right?

They should be dismantled for being anti-American, or unconstitutional, or something. They are making a mockery of our country, and Not supporters at all, right?"
0,"There is no such thing as a moderate democrat at this point. A good example is Joe Biden. Joe is now, because the GOP has shifted so far right, basically a 1980's republican. You are either progressive or in the wrong party."
0,"Well…..that’s what the GOP does. They minimize their failures and maximizes others.

And don’t say that “both sides are the same”. This meme is the first I knew about the four killed in Niger."
0,"By putting our ally Chad, on the no fly list, trumpy caused the death of these four soldiers. When trumpy did this, Chad immediately pulled their soldiers out if the area. It was the first day going out looking for insurgents without the aid of soldiers from Chad. Why weren't there tons of investigations into this? Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi, though."
0,"So the trouble with the right wing is that nothing is hypocritical to them because the way they think is that as long as it serves their political goals it's right and proper. 

This is so fundamental that they're not capable of true hypocritical thinking because their so backwards that they can't line the two hypocritical thoughts up. 

George Orwell called it ""Double Think"" and it's legit terrifying."
0,Buttery mails! SMH. I hate the GOP
0,"And let's not forget that he had no business being there--apparently it was some kind of favor to Putin, and he sent mercenary soldiers, not Marines, who then left behind the soldiers, including one who was still alive, but then ambushed and mutilated (that's the one whose mother he said ""he knew what he was getting into"" to).   He caused their deaths.   

The even worse hypocrisy was their absolute radio silence on this--Trump literally CAUSING the needless deaths of four American soldiers--after years and years and years of screaming about Benghazi (which was an attack on the US Embassy in a known hotspot, the same as other attacks during the Bush and Reagan presidencies--AND Hillary had requested add'l security, and the GOP had refused it)."
0,"And four Nigerien troops were killed too. 

Also, a typical Trumpian ""Blame Obama"" attack: 

>On 17 October, during a press conference, Trump was asked about his silence by a reporter and commented on the incident. Trump responded by saying that he wrote letters to the families of the victims, and accused his predecessors, specifically President Obama, of not or rarely calling the families of deceased soldiers."
0,The GOP does this because they get away with it every time.
0,"He also got a SEAL killed in his first military action. Crickets.

Edit: and this was *just* off of the Benghazi series of investigations that republicans found nothing actionable with, even after 11 hours of sworn testimony.  Imagine Trump in the same situation."
0,"Well, see, in Trump-world the only deaths that count are not under Republican watch.  The rest of the deaths are jack shit."
0,Don't  forget these soldiers were just losers and suckers according to trump
0,"Don't sign up for the military if you don't want to die. My GF's entire family is republican and they asked my opinion about all these deaths happening with the withdrawal from Afghanistan. 

Why do they all of a sudden care about these deaths when we spent 20 years either being killed or killing people?

Fucking blows my mind the stupid shit these people say."
0,"Remember when we just blew off the Kurds, our allies, leaving them to fend against both Assad and the Turks?  But we are incensed at Biden leaving the the Afghans in Afghanistan after getting over 100,000 of them out?"
0,Any time they say they ‘support the troops’ this as well as their hostility towards the VA and veterans homelessness and mental health should be brought up immediately.
0,"To be fair, allowing Trump to pronounce Niger would be a very dangerous request."
0,Using the deaths of soldiers for political gain is an incredibly low thing to do. Do not sink to the Republicans level.
0,This was on the news.  The only places where it was censored was on right-wing fake news propaganda.
0,Trump couldn't remember her husband's name.
0,"I always shudder with amazement how any veteran could ever support Trump over Biden in any way. The difference between the two on Veteran's issue is about as far apart as one could get:

""No way they could make John Kerry look like a pussy, he was a highly decorated combat veteran while GW was getting high in Texas"" 

""They've said all this stuff about Obama being a Kenyan Muslim who eats dogs, but they'll HAVE to change their tune now that bin Laden is dead""

""No way that Republicans in Kentucky would pick swamp thing Mitch McConnell over a distinguished Air Force pilot with all the funding in the world""

It's like dude, you don't get it... these people could not give less of a shit about ""the troops"" or ""the flag"" and they certainly don't care about being caught up in some technical hypocrisy. They like cruelty, they like the war. They love that violence is being done to people who they dislike, that's all. It's a really simple, yet totally terrifying."

0,"See, exploitation shouldn't be allowed under law. Even you should know that legality ≠ morality. The least that we're calling for is a mandatory democratic workplace. Workers owning their workplace, and voting on everything that a CEO or manager would just dictate. Need more window cleaner in your department? Vote on it, instead of risking your shitty manager saying no to a necessary item for your work. Job too complex to function without a managerial position? Vote for someone to act as manager. If they get shitty, vote them out. Vote on your pay. Vote on expansion. Vote on recruits. 

We're just asking for democracy. The freedom to vote on things that affect you on a personal level.

This capitalist society we've been living in isn't democratic. The democracy we slapped onto our government system is just a bandaid, or more like a blind, to hide the fact that our real overlords aren't the politicians we vote for, but the  billionaires that buy the politicians that we vote for.

Agree with u again, financial worth isn’t decided by you, it’s decided by the people paying you, and companies make less money the more they pay their employees. No one should be working for an unliveable wage, and since minimum wage hasn’t exactly continued to be proportional to the cost of living, many people ARE working for less than their worth. People are realizing they are worth more, and hopefully more and more people will realize in the near future. Maybe you don’t deserve a  $10 million salary, but you certainly deserve more than you make now, as does everyone else on the fucking planet. Your concept of financial worth works, but the people on the other side think everyone is worth pay as little as they can get away with.

Not everyone can just go work 70-90 hours of work or school, and I think the “just get a job” argument is one of the dumbest and most impractical pieces of advice. Not only is the recruiting process hell for everyone, but especially the disadvantaged. Now I’m glad that you were able to go to school and get what you wanted, but there is no reality where a significant amount of people could do that. Do you really imagine people unhappy with their job haven’t considered getting a different one? I apologize but this point of contention is bare bones, shallow, and downright ignorant.

I will say your tbh about 40 hours not being that much absolutely decimated my original statement regarding a 40 hour week. You’re absolutely right, people who only work of the day 5 days a week deserve to be treated like shit by their employers, and since they don’t work weekends, why do they deserve a reasonable wage amiright???"
0,"Do you like gardening?

Nothing grows on infertile, hostile soil.

I see poverty, homelessness, etc as just letting the weeds grow. They only get worse the longer they grow. Criminalizing hasn't worked. Let's try housing, education, and healthcare (including mental), please?"

0,"If i understand you correctly, the problem with  1. seem more of a social issue than economic issue.
And with 2. has it been calculated before? I only know of interviews with andrea yang, who claimed the maths works if you eventually begin to tax filthy large companies like amazon and the likes.
I do not have a clue, but from my lofe experience i learnt that it is worth it to aim high and land somewhat lower.

Tl;dr is it really doomed? Why not give it a try?"
0,"So, anecdotally it's easy to make a company. Perfect. Let me gather my vast funding and do so. 

Nothing is objective about exploitation, my friend. Exploitation happens between at least two people, with one of them believing it's not exploitation. That's very subjective. 

I can tell you that the folks believe that extracting profit from a laborer is exploitation, and that's why they hate working in the current system.

It's not fulfilling to have your boss take upwards of 80% of the money you make for them. I can attest to that. Quite frankly, it's soul crushing. It shouldn't be fulfilling to have a bunch of *people* laboring *for* you. That's some kingpin bullshit. If you want to be king of the castle so badly, go play chess, instead of literally exploiting people for your own personal gain."
0,"Dude you’re not understanding what I’m saying. People who work 40 hours aren’t as valuable as people who work 100, obviously. I am trying to put across that people want to make a few more dollars an hour and not get treated like shit, but you seem to be too proud of throwing years of your life away working in a flawed system to understand that you, along with everyone else except the elite, are getting fucked"
0,No. No you didn't. 'Trillions' have been spent to keep homeless people out of view. Very little of this money has been spent on actually helping the homeless

Ever since Nixon, conservatives agenda has been to tell the Middle Class that the poor were stealing from them, while at the same time, instituting policies that shifted the resources of this country into the hands of a few of the already very wealthy.
And it is not just conservatives. Democrats who fashion themselves as ""moderates"" are working for the same people that conservatives are, i.e., the people with the freaking money."

It is far past time to burn it to the ground."
0,"THIS. THIS is why I tune in here, to hear the ROTpublicans try to divine the Secrets of the Capitalist Universe on their own. How do I know on their own? Because they WON'T LISTEN TO ANYONE ELSE. They won't listen to blacks of any stripe; they won't listen to Hispanics. They won't listen to women, or Libs, or Progressives, or children, or ANYONE who insists that the idea of God has to pass even the most feeble standards of discussion, or science, or even education. And why do they hyperventilate so? Because THEIR idea of what God is, can't pass even those abbreviated tests.

ROTpublicans proudly stand for ALL the rest of us, those groups I detailed above, just pulling in our unruly noses, and letting them ride roughshod over us and our priorities.

And since ROTpublicans HAVE NO MORALS to speak of, they are not willing to just go home when they DON'T HAVE THE MAJORITY. No, they've got to then STEAL the votes, by screwing up the entire voting system... and KEEPING it screwed up in a ROTpublican direction.

Our task now is to stop that from happening. Period."

0,"Grumpy Old Party hardly conveys the true depth of malice that ruling Republicans are guilty of these days!. Such a cute-worded description as, ""grumpy old party"" to describe the right is like saying,. ""Yeah, they've done some bad things,  but, they meant well.""  Already there is a great problem with Republican's blatantly, shamelessly lying  and denying, plus refusing  to acknowledge the damage they have done, all to please Donald J. Trump. Please don't use endearing words to describe any of them until we know the depth of their involvement . They are a terrorist gang now, with crimes against America too numerous to mention. Many right-wing politicians became traitors on the day insurrectionists impersonated patriots as they violated America. And now for some bizarro reason-they defy helping America end the pandemic. They are willing to even put their own children's lives at stake to ""own the libs""  they say. That's not even the American thing to do.  Who are these people who think they are patriots and why don't they realize they are acting more like bullies or terrorists themselves?"

All pushing to have households to be allowed to have weapons means that households are going to absolutely need them.  The only beneficiaries to this are the ultra wealthy who can have their own armed guards and the weapons companies.  The rest of the country suffers.
0,Trump was caught betraying america on January 6th. A violent rebellion to attempt a takeover of the government. That is the ultimate fascist move.

0,People are so broke in CA they have to rent a room in a house just to survive and stay off the streets and out of living in their vehicle. There is still a problem with landlords justifying evictions and against the law causing people to move out within a day's notice and having their security deposits stolen. Landlords can continue to make security deposits over false notions and make people's lives worse. The houses are not necessarily being torn down. They're just converted. It would be nice if a studio apartment didn't cost more than you make at a minimum wage job that you have to walk to because you still can't afford a vehicle. Craziness.

Instead, they behave like the neighborhood bullies, arrogantly believing they can get away with any abuses of their neighbors, because of our military support. We shouldnt make ourselves a partner in this.

Unfortunately, that's basically how their current nation was built - by pushing, bullying, & forcing their way into the region, with so many offences committed, doubtful anyone wants to play nice with them, now... They have left themselves with no choice, except to annihilate their enemies, or be annihilated, & that is exactly how they behave - like all the Palestinians must be annihilated, all their land taken, in order for Israel to exist, at all. That is a corner they backed themselves into - when they showed no willingness to show compassion to their fellow humans, or seek out peace, thru diplomacy - always resorting to brute force to achieve purely selfish ends, instead of cultivating peaceful relations, in a land they reside in, thanks only to the concessions others have made, on their behalf. Perhaps a bit more humility, gratitude, & compassion would have resulted in a better outcome?"

They should both be Republicans because they follow McConnell's lead. Getting rid of the filibuster is the only way to make change in the voting rights.

0,"That’s exactly what I’m talking about - the federal funds are spent federally, not (mostly) distributed as budget transfers. They’re spent on the federal social safety net, ie Medicare Medicaid and social security.

That’s not an economic subsidy. It’s federal programs that every American pays into and every American is entitled to draw from. The alternative is that an American worker is less worthy of social security (as a concept) based on where they live, which is stupid frankly. 

Happy to link the Rockefeller institutes research on this topic, which shows exactly what you would expect… that a map of federal spending per capita is identical to a map of per capita elderly Americans, poverty, and disability rates. With some outliers like Virginia having a large amount of federal offices of course, and New Mexico with federal labs."

Those are facts. 

That, and many of our most notable white inventors were likely to have been on the autism spectrum: Einstein, Tesla, even Jefferson.  If some of the newly minted eductors would ditch the inflammatory rhetoric, quit giving bonus points for protest attendance, stuck to the grim truths of American history, and taught critical thinking instead of trying to piss people off, this country might get somewhere.

0,"1.  Volunteer with your local chapter of the Democratic party.  Party planks and platforms are often written by the small number of people who bother to show up.  Having been involved with local democratic politics throughout my teens and early adulthood (I've had to stop since it's considered a conflict of interest with my current job) I can assure you, the people showing up are not always the people we want writing the party platform.  Most the people showing up have big financial interests in getting certain things done.  If we want democracy to work, we need to be more active in it.

2.  Vote in every election, especially at the local level.  The local level has huge influence on your day to day life, your vote carries more weight at the local level, and our next national level candidates have to get their start somewhere.  Voting in every election also means doing your homework.  Get to know the candidates.  For my most recent state delegate primary, I had a chance to talk with both the individuals on the ballot and got a solid feel for both.  It was clear the less funded guy was better to me, but he lost pretty decisively.  So few people do the homework so the woman with the slick mailers won.

3.  Run yourself.  As I already said, democracy only works if we work it.  If the people running aren't getting the job done, then someone else needs to step up.  And frankly, I'd rather vote for the reluctant candidate running to do the right thing than the person who really wants power.  I'm afraid of people who want power.

You'll notice my advice has nothing to do with this particular issue.  That's because if we don't get the foundation right, we will never be able to get the big stuff right.  It's all hard work I propose, no easy answers I fear."

0,I quite like Biden and I think you’re completely right. We’re not trump supporters who look at the president and think he’s gods gift to our cause. He’s a human and he makes mistakes. Hell Anita Hill herself endorsed him in the last election despite everything that happened back then.
0,"Too bad your claim wasn't reasonable, huh? Odd how you failed to mention that the African-American community was split on the Thomas nomination, huh?

But then your goal was to blame Biden. Mentioning the pressure put on him by African-American men wouldn't serve your purpose, would it?"

0,"Let’s see if he makes the right choice this time. Like I said, I would hope that he has the guts to take a stance and get behind the push for expanding the court. This Supreme Court is completely broken. It’s a bunch of crazy right wingers with an agenda to undo all of the progress that has been made in the last 100 years. The filibuster is already going to be the reason the dems will loose seats in 2022, and McConnell would have already gotten rid of it if the dems were doing the same thing. In my opinion Biden and the rest of the conservative dems need to grow a pair and get things done, or we are going to loose the country."

0,"- you are so mistaken in what republicans are, they LOVE BIG GOVT and massive deficits and taxcuts that lead to record debt,"
0,The US is a two party system and the ideologies have changed over time. At the moment however republicans represent white supremacy and the fear that their power is declining. This ideology is not justifiable in any working society and you see this played out over and over. So to be a democrat at this moment means against that. Unfortunately that is the stark reality.
0,"> What the fuck has happened to the Republican Party? They used to have valid representation

Like McCain, Romney, Flake, Collins, and Murkowski?  Save us from such valid ""Republicans""."
0,Almost like better living conditions result in a populace that doesn't resort to violence. Whoda thunk.
0,"Republicans need something to explain why they don't like brown people.

Crime stats from Denmark are what work today."
0,"I was responding to a comment about statistics being xenophobic. I simply stated that was false and foolish and that statistics can be misleading.



Denmark is the fifth most safe country in the world, and while mainstream news admits there are issues in respect to this area,



The reality is that reporting lags behind. I don’t know the reason for this, but since under reporting is rampant, it makes sense that criminal convictions would follow suit.  Instead of blaming a minority, this article describes a traumatizing process as the major issue.



This article expands on how antiquated the laws are, specifically calling for changes to acquaintance rape, the most common type of rape.  

The statistics are misleading because people are using it push a false narrative which blames refugees coming from a particular locality. It fails to account for the realities of the law and the people living there.  In short, statistics are misleading, and some people in this community are pushing their own narrative instead of actually doing the legwork."
0,"He didn't respond because Uniform Code requires him not to speak on political matters which is what he said - I'm not defending him I'm answering a question as to why he is not in violation - when did the GOP become so touchy Feely - he broke the code,  - he's undisciplined - military discipline is crucial to the national defense - end"
0," boosters just started so that’s not relevant. 

Look at Sweden’s vaccination rate. Additionally because mask mandates don’t exist doesn’t mean people aren’t wearing masks and distancing because they are.  Nordics take community efforts seriously and usually don’t need to be mandated to do the right thing."
0,"You are correct.  I was looking at unvaccinated case rates, not country wide case rates.  That was my mistake and I apologize for the error.  The statistic that’s missing here is the country wide vaccination rate.  Sweden is far ahead of Israel on that which is what’s driving their low case rate

Message stays the same.  Wear a mask.  Get Vaccinated.  If you’re sick, stay away from others.  This is basic healthcare stuff that we’ve known about for several centuries."

0,"It doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter if the Taliban is awful. Saudi Arabia is beyond awful, and you guys just gave them billions of dollars in weapons. Trump bragged about it being the biggest weapons deal in history. United States supports right-wing fascist dictators all over the planet right now as of this moment. No country on Earth has more blood on its hands than the United States."

0,"This will be the mainstream media if we let trump and his racist thugs Republicants get back into office.  Except their name will be called the ""Tali-KLAN""."
0,This is what is going to happen in the USA.  if we let Trump supporters take over the government.  Just take a look at their policies and it matches the taliban.
0,"Oh Ana, you open with a question that presupposes that religious zealots think rationally. Haven't you seen enough of the Christian Taliban here in the US to know better?"
0,Saudi Arabia created the Taliban. And Bush helped them. And Trump owes MBS millions.

0,Trump needs to SHUT UP and not cause people to follow him on the bad side of law.  He needs to SHUT up.  People need to listen to themselves not someone whom causes trouble and insites riots and problems for police and people who do not want what he wants.
0,"This police officer is right.
Trump needed to shut up a long time ago. If he listened to that advise, Trump would have been president. As far as I am concerned,  Trump cost himself the election, cause Trump loves hearing himself too much talk. 
Trump and his terrorists has to go."

Since it is very important,  so every State Capital and national guard can stop the mad attacks from Trumpiests who are armed and dangerous. I pray Joe Biden and Kamila Harris take over White House in peace. But before that all who are protectors of state capitol and our democracy should remove these dangerous organizations asap. 
Please watch this:

0,"Simple, we need to seperate from these racist. We need to have our people teach our children. We need to not join the military and defend these racist fighting the wars they start. We need to completely separate. And if these racist start something, we end it without showing mercy! Banning books on actual, factual history is the beginning.

0,"*There's nothing free or Constitutional about trump or the entire Republicon party!*  Pelosi better not trust the 2 on the Jan 6th investigation, they can't ever be trusted!

What a bunch of lying hypocrites they are. They are doing what  trump accused China of doing to the Uighurs, creating re-education camps and forcing it on the blacks! 

Women in China's ""re-education"" camps for Uighurs have been systematically raped, sexually abused, and tortured. The republicans working in every area in this dysfunctional legal system have been doing the latter for many, many years!

The Hispanics are afraid to say boo and draw attention to themselves, or they'll be the next to go.

*""HIDDEN FIGURES WAS A FABULOUS MOVIE!""*"
0,"Of course they support it-they enabled the first one!  The GOP is completely corrupt, toxic & Trump enablers."
0,"Dear: Republican Party

  When it came time to protect America you refused when the Alt-Right and the Neo-Nazis came you kept the door open for them. 

When Trump back these hate groups you protected him, a P.R. statement saying you refuse to support racism, then back Trump's hatemongering declarations the very next day. 

Who are you people to accept racism as a political platform? When David Duke supports Trump you did nothing, just give me my Tax Cuts and my Judges Mr. Trump.  

African Americans are being attacked on the streets by Americans for, cooking, sleeping, shopping by Trump Supporters you could care less. 

When Trump broke the law dealing with Russia you protected him again. 

  Meanwhile, the hate groups are getting stronger, Anti-Governments Groups increase, but you Republicans do nothing. 

I say this as an independent voter you have permitted Donald Trump to become an American Dictator to keep your power. 

He Attacked Black Lives Matter for his supremacist racist base, for a Photo Op. 
The Republicans did nothing, Terrorist attacked Michigan's Capital you did nothing to stop Trump. 
Trump told the Proud Boys, I'm with you 
The Republicans did nothing. 
The Capital Has Been Attacked and you have settled back and have allowed Donald Trump and his followers to commit treason.  

I say this to you honestly all of you are cowards to the Ameican People. It might not feel that way with the backing of Right-Wing Media, The Power and Money you have gained. 

We all saw it though, time after time watching you allowing Trump to do anything he wanted. 

A police officer has died and yes every one of you Republicans is to blame for his death, Fox News can't help you spin out of this. 

There is no honor, no integrity, or compassion within your party. 

Why do you ignore white supremacy and their organizations? 

Time won't heal this one, you have shown us who you are and we will never forget. 

Never Forget.
