2.0,"Although I agree Gov. Cuomo's behavior seemed inappropriate at times & probably is best if he stepped down, don't think of the accounts I've heard that anything was criminal or against the law. Maybe he will find some other work as he seems like a very decent man. Hoping the new governor Kathy Hochul will do good for the great state of New York."
2.0,I still say he made trump look bad during the first Covid and he's getting payback. I notice that women always believe women. I'm not convinced this time. I think she's (the one all over tv) is collecting a big paycheck. Just my humble opinion.
2.0,We should also not elect abusers to become president
2.0,"Sometimes people don‚Äôt tell the truth, and that‚Äôs okay to admit as well. This abuser vs. abused binary is divisive and leaves 0 room for nuance. Sometimes trauma makes us believe something is happening that isn‚Äôt actually happening. That‚Äôs called psychic equivalence, and it‚Äôs a real thing, and it is not victim-blaming.
And no, that‚Äôs not the case all the time, but it does happen ‚Ä¶ a lot. We are entirely abandoning reality with these victim axioms as if there is no way on earth that there‚Äôs another side to things. THAT is just as well the first step toward totalitarianism

2.0,"Biden said Cuomo did a hell of a job, except personally. There's the way Cuomo governed and another way he acted in a purely personal capacity that had nothing to do with being governor. And ""Our American Cousin"" was a hell of a play and a fine presentation by Ford's theater until John Wilkes Booth interrupted it halfway through. Patrons never even got their money back. And that's what's so sad, as Biden noted."

2.0,I don‚Äôt agree he should not have resigned. He was good for the state and got things done. This is the first time I have ever disagreed with AOC.
2.0,Agreed. I was disappointed in his statement about the line being ‚Äúredrawn‚Äù. It‚Äôs a face saving excuse and he needs to drop that and admit he knew he could flex his power over women because he‚Äôs been the governor. We need truth.

2.0,"I am angry and appalled at the recent events involving police and deaths of young black men. With that out of the way,I am the mother of a hard working, caring, good police officer who puts his life in danger on a very consistent basis. While those that do wrong should without a doubt be punished, let's not forget that there are more good cops than bad ones. Recruitment of police officers in this day and age is a challenge and it doesn't help that they are not paid enough for what they do either. Just remember to judge the individual for their actions and not every cop on the beat. I sincerely hope to see change to make everyone safer"
2.0,It‚Äôs a tragic incident for all parties involved.. so sad he had to resist and cause the escalation.
2.0,"Question is , what are you politicians doing about it , or do you prefer to talk just enough to get re-elected? Do what they need you to do instead of saying it if you really want to make a difference! Once election season come around we the people Hear and watch nothing but promises and no action !"
2.0,"Your comments are not based on on emotion and presumption. The facts in this case do not support your assertions.This is very irresponsible behavior from a public figure and I would expect that people in positions of power and influence would feel the need to hold themselves to a higher standard.

2.0,Funny they never say it's too much when waging war.
2.0,Too much is when you decimate the American economy and send manufacturing jobs overseas only to create even worse pollution on the other side of the earth. Too much is when the government spends seniors SS money on programs to create more dependent voters. Too much is when govt overregulates businesses including child care facilities so much that they need a lawyer in house to navigate those laws/ regulations.
2.0,"How about saving the American people who put you in your senate seat? When you said you had the people in your forefront I didn‚Äôt know you meant the people of the taliban and the people of Haiti!

‚ÄúToo much child care‚Äù is the point where companies continue to refuse to pay a living wage because they can rely on the government to force workers back into their jobs.
Your appeal to emotion is warranted, and there should be a conversation, but also given the way the federal government has screwed everyone with the ACA, it‚Äôs not surprising people are wary of giving more money and freedom to the fed."

2.0,"To the greedy elites, any amount that doesn't generate them wealth or directly benefit them is too much"
2.0,"Bernie Sanders
Are you ready for a radical statement? I happen to think that Joe Manchin is right. Yeah, physical infrastructure is terribly important. But I happen to think that the needs of the human beings of our country ‚Äî working families, the children, the elderly, the poor ‚Äî are even more important, and we can and must do both.
Look, everybody in America ‚Äî whether you're Republican, Democrat or independent ‚Äî understands that, for the last many years, the very richest people in this country and the largest corporations have done phenomenally well, while the working class and the middle class of this country struggle, and we have got close to 600,000 people sleeping out on the streets.

Elderly people in America can't afford to put dentures into their mouth. They have no teeth in their mouth in some cases, can't afford hearing aids, can't afford eyeglasses. Working families cannot afford child care for their kids. Young people cannot afford to go to college.

And then on top of all of that, the scientific community is telling us that we're looking at a cataclysmic crisis in terms of climate. Oregon is burning. California is burning.

People are drowning in New York City. Detroit is flooding. Siberia has seen the largest fire on Earth. Drought is happening in places all over the world.

The United States must lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel. This is a crisis we are living in.

So, what polling tells us is that working families all over this country understand that NOW is the time for Congress to address the long neglected problems facing working families. Now is the time to have the wealthy and large corporations -- we've got billionaires in this country who don't pay a nickel in federal income tax.
So, I think we can do all of this. We can do the physical infrastructure.
We can do the reconciliation bill, create millions of good jobs, and finally tell the American people that we are going to stand up for working families ‚Äî not just the rich and the powerful. Let's get it done.

Reminder: The actual cost of the Build Back Better Act is not $3.5 trillion, it's $0. The funding working families need is going to be paid for by taxing the wealthiest and corporations."

2.0,"Here's an idea:
End Billionaires Disease, before it ends all life on earth.
Clearly, one cannot attain infinite wealth on a finite planet, without causing serious harm to the environment.
The scientific evidence is abundant, undeniably.

To govern a thing, is to limit a thing.
To consume a thing, is to extinguish a thing.
Clearly, we're facing a failure in global leadership in big business and the many governments they now outright control.

Therefore, no one or thing should be allowed to accumulate so much cash that they can then use to hold others in jeopardy for their own benefit.

There's only one almost national party that has a written platform that addresses the many foul policies enacted by the parties over the last many/ beyond the grasp of Unregulated Capitalism.

2.0,"Bernie ur great, but u been saying the same stuff for years, & nothing been done.

So here's a NEW IDEA.
Can u & ur colleagues start referring to health insurance has a SOCIALIST CONCEPT, and belongs in a SOCIALIST MODEL.

Just saying it's a human right is fine, but that doesn't move the needle to much. U have to get ppl to see the logic, and change their minds. And u can do that better, by exposing the health insurance companies by doing the messaging this way.

How do health insurance companies make money?

They collect premiums r deny ppl coverage. THAT'S IT! And if u think about that, what is that, that's a SOCIALIST CONCEPT. If the CEO of XYZ insurance company is not happy making $5 million a year, they want to make 50 millon a year, what do they have to do, r the only thing they can do, is raise PREMIUMS r DENY ppl coverage. THAT'S IT. That's a socialist CONCEPT & belongs in a socialist MODEL. If u put a SOCIALIST concept into a CAPITALIST model, it will butt heads. It will not be as efficient r effective. And that's what we have now. And vice verse, u don't want a CAPITALIST concept in a SOCIALIST model. Otherwise, we'll all be waiting hours in line for stale bread. It's not like the CEO of walmart, if they want to make more money, they have to sell more, r be more efficient in their operations.Thus
, CAPITALIST CONCEPT, belongs in CAPITALIST MODEL. Same goes for health insurance companies. It's a SOCIALIST CONCEPT, & belongs in a SOCIALIST MODEL. Bcuz all they can do to make more money is raise premiums & deny ppl coverage. And that puts the squeeze on patients & doctors.

If u do the messaging this way, this will move the needle more to universal health insurance, bcuz ppl will see the truth & logic. Instead of just saying it's a human right, which it is, but to get more ppl to believe in universal health insurance, u need to do the messaging this way. A socialist CONCEPT belongs in a socialist MODEL. At minimum it should be non-profit.

I have some good ideas how to make to get this point across. And I'm sure, if u start this messaging, it will get done. Start beating the Republicans at their own game."

2.0,I‚Äôm sick and tired of people being sick and tired. I‚Äôm tired of people needing insulin in the first place. The cost of the drugs isn‚Äôt the problem! The fact that so many need them is the problem. Why are so many Americans sick? That‚Äôs what people need to focus on!
2.0,I agree this is a problem. But very few people use insulin in a vial these days. Let's talk about insulin pens and get up to speed. Or perhaps compare the average cost for 1 month's supply of insulin.

2.0,"I'm Swedish, but if I had been American I would have fought hard for improving the health care system in the US, the richest country in the world.

Anyway, the taxes are spent on health care among other things. Insulin is free, no cost for the patient at all.

Yes, I'm very aware you can't compare the US to Sweden. We're a small country with a different system. But if anyone is going to change the system, it's Bernie. He would be a kick-*ss president.

2.0,"Yes - this is unacceptable. EVERYONE thinks it's unacceptable - everyone except certain greedy lawmakers. We need to replace representatives

2.0,"What I don't get is how the corporation gets sole ownership of the patent if the American citizens are paying for the research and development of many of these drugs.

First, that sounds 100% like an administrative failure. Drug companies don't just get this research funding out of thin air. They negotiate with the government for them. Exactly like with the Covid vaccines. That deal has been outstanding for the American people. Could you imagine if everyone had to buy our vaccines out of pocket or through insurance? We probably wouldn't have 25% of Americans vaccinated, and they'd be coming from Europe.

I would laugh in the face of a drug co CEO if he came to me with a bullshit deal like what we have been getting. I would feel like he was spitting in my face. I would kick them out of the White House and call his biggest competitor asking if they would like to be the first drug company to release xyz drug? Yeah? Great, but if Americans are paying for the research we get royalties on sales which will go to help fund future medical research, and there will be cap limits on American patients, with lower caps for the elderly and veterans. We would get that drug developed and CEOs would seriously think twice about going to the White House thinking that they are going to scam the American people."

2.0,$12 Canadian or US?
2.0,How about just seizing production and nationalizing this key industry and redistributing it to patients with prescriptions? For bonus points go after the criminals that run these companies for the suffering and death they cause.
2.0,We need to find out who‚Äôs on bed with the pharma companies.
2.0,Hey Bernie Sanders one day soon. I look to millenials and a see great hope for the nation. They've suffered through so much and that suffering has made a compassionate and caring nation. They might make alot of mistakes along their path to a more perfect union but I have complete faith in them.
2.0,It's hard to tell if you are one of the good guys. Most of what you say seems to divide and I can't help but wonder if that is by design. The government paid for the research and development of a vaccine and then most likely borrowed money from China to pay for and distribute that vaccine worldwide. Essentially you are right. What you aren't saying is telling.
2.0,Too bad we don't have a Senator with the backbone to get anything done about it.
2.0,"You and Congress have had more time to fix this years ago, SAME BS EVERY TIME"
2.0,It is sad we have idiots in Congress that have been there over 20 years and caused this.
2.0,Well pull your Pinocchio nose out or their rear end and you quit supporting those who support Big Pharma. You are as dirty as the rest of your peers!! Supporting Big Pharma and their paid elected suits you‚Äôre agenda very well. You are just as corrupt as anybody!!!

2.0,"Don‚Äôt be deceived by the ad on TV asking ‚ÄúTell Congress: There‚Äôs a better way.‚Äù The deceptive ad wants the viewer to believe ‚Äúthe Government will decide what medicines I can get.‚Äù Ha! Like we can medicines now? Right? Huh? By the way, the ad is paid for by‚Ä¶.. guess who‚Ä¶.PhRMA (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America)!"

Covid positive or not, immunization or not, mask or not....everyone
deserves access to antibiotics and steroid boosters when sick....before they get to ICU levels. The Dr are dressed in war garb giving out opinions not scripts....ever
yone needs to wake up!!"
2.0,One month supply of Accutane costs under $10 outside of the US. Americans pay $300-$400 for the same prescription. Tretinoin costs $2 there and $200 in the US. We are paying ridiculous amounts of money to fill the pockets of the big Pharma. Why? So they can invest that $$$ into lobbying and make sure the drug prices are not regulated. Result: They can legally rip us off all they want. This has to change!
2.0,U.S. PHARMACEUTICAL POLITICS ARE A SICKNESS. Only true patriotism will cure that sickness. Big pharma need to be taken on by big men. Not little men....
2.0,Change the law prohibiting import from Canada. Problem solved.
2.0,Bernie Sanders should worry more about the greed of the politicians that he works with.
2.0,Bernie Sanders why did you let this happen ?
2.0,"Allow the government to produce those drugs and sell it to Americans at costs. People getting filthy, bloody wealthy off of other peoples illnesses."
2.0,"I'm not a person to easily jump up and say ""this offends me!""

2.0,"How come Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a 2019 law making his state one of six moving to create a program to facilitate the importation of medicines from Canada, where prescription drugs are available on average at roughly half the American price, while the legislation still requires the federal government to invalidate Shalala's 2001 veto and approve state importation plans‚Äîand now DeSantis is pressuring the Biden administration ""to act immediately to approve Florida's plan that will ultimately help drive down costs for taxpayers."" You are in the Senate, even states are already ahead and ready to import drugs at lower price. After all, free market can help if some of you in the Congress don't let pharma companies buy you out through donations while promoting federal sources to prevent others to enter the market."
2.0,"If pharmaceutical companies in Canada are turning a profit, does that mean American companies are making a killing?"
2.0,"Change the laws then. Are ya'll having a hard time bearing lobbyists? Sure ya'll are when the whole game of politics here is about dividing people on key issues, arguing like a bunch of immature children, and nothing ever gets solved. All of you bring up the same issues that ya'll have for the past 4 decades and promise to do something about it, when deep down you know you can't, you don't have the power to as one politician. Then lobbyists come, pay some of you off and five kickbacks. Ya'll threaten a government shutdown, then porkspending, then repeat. If you all cared about citizens this would have never happened, the opiod epidemic would have never happened, because ya'll wouldn't have sold citizens out to Purdue pharma and other companies. Business as usual there. You can talk all that you want, but actually doing something and bringing other politicians together to change things is what leaders do. They solve problems."
2.0,Like Trump did!
2.0,"Oh, Reek... if you were really sick of it you wouldn't have dropped pushing for Medicare for all, in the middle of a pandemic, and worst economic crises since the great depression."
2.0,And you guys still believe big pharma will save you? Pls don't be ridiculous! They can save the world with a vaccine developed in less than 6 months apparently but they.cant provide a safe treatment for cancer after all those years... ü§îüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ
2.0,There were three democrats who have blocked lowering prices. Each has received big campaign contributions from big pharma. They need to be made poster children of the influence big pharma and big money in general has on issues affecting the pocketbooks of working Americans. Start calling out folks by name please Bernie this has to stop
2.0,"Ok guy who gave 4 trillion to Wall Street last year.

I totally believe you."
2.0,What do Americans pay for the covid vaccine?
2.0,"Abolish the FDA, and watch prices tumble. The FDA requires mountains of paperwork and tests, but provides zero liability against lawsuits. Think about that. Where else can you demand a drug company give you medicine, then sue them for giving it to you?"
2.0,Wish you were our president
2.0,"Canadian doctors Banting and Best developed insulin, and sold the patent rights for one Canadian"
2.0,Bernie Sanders are you for vaccine mandates?
2.0,But how will the pharmaceutical companies pay for research and ceo bonuses
2.0,That is because you approved a regulation as part of Obamacare specifically disallowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies. Look in the mirror!
2.0,"It‚Äôs because Canada exports oil, so they have a lot more cash per person to subsidize pharma costs"
2.0,How do you combat those sickening commercials convincing people that Medicare negotiating prescription drug prices means people will lose access to drugs they take? What planet do people live on that they don't know that the insurance carriers decide whether you can have a drug or not?
2.0,I remember back in March of 2020 when the Norwegian University of Science and Technology called the US health services poorly developed. Enough said.

2.0,"That's why it should be so clear to all of us, that she and Manchin are NOT acting in the general interest; just theirs!!!!!!"
2.0,But remember Tlaib is an outlier. Agree with her sentiment but that is the party she is a member of...she is outside the mainstream.
2.0,"I have a question about mandatory paid parental leave. Who pays for it? If the answer is the employer, no matter how few employees the employer has, think about the following scenario, which happened to someone I know in the UK: A teacher with young children employs a nanny. The nanny gets pregnant and has a baby. The teacher now has to pay for several months parental leave PLUS the salary of a second nanny to care for her children."
2.0,Disgusting example of grifting on the taxpayers dime and ignorance

2.0,"Citizens United needed to be overturned, but I don't see that happening with the poor excuse for a Supreme Court currently in place."
2.0,you know the other option is get a job and pay the rent. In all my life I never thought I'd see this. I had my own apartment when I was a teenager. I worked and went to school. I knew that I needed to pay the rent or I'd get locked out of my place... it was that simple.. you know why I knew this.. because my parents were horrible at this and I lived with a history of getting evicted from homes as a child. you keep doing this and you're teaching these people that there are no consequences to their actions. you cannot tell me it's because they cannot find a job... I see for hire signs EVERYWHERE. STOP THIS MADNESS!
2.0,"I so wish the media would stop calling these people ""moderates."""
2.0,It's amazing and very disappointing how so many don't care about the people who voted for them. It's time to take this power back and vote these people out of off to the point where the numbers are so great..that they can't be refuted.
2.0,IMHO neither party is really working for the 'average working person'. But the Democrats are closer to being. Both sides can't afford to irritate the donors who finance their campaigns.
2.0,"GREED, NOTHING CHANGES, THE BIG CORPORATIONS WANT ALL THE RIGHTS AND THE MONEY, THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS SHAMFUL, IS TNIS REALLY AMERICA"
2.0,Ignore it. The expenditures were already authorized.

2.0,"She may be bought and paid for ( owned ) by big pharmaceutical companies, but her constituents are feed up with her. I'm an AZ democrat who voted for her, and I will NOT make that mistake again! Her votes have been a huge slap in the face to her AZ constituents. She is voting against everything she campaigned on, and her constant are watching. She may only get a second term as an AZ Senator if she switches and becomes a republican. Dems in AZ are feed up with her votes and her VERY childish drama."
2.0,"Most likely she became friends with mr Manchin‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs Bigly lying Pharma friends to meet with Bigly Pharma lobbyist to negotiate bribery money, instead of voting for a legitimate legislation that would help More than half of the population in medical care !!!

My main point is, are the police not there to protect and serve the people? This whole thing, even if there actually is a pandemic why brutalize your own! Nothing about these times follow any kind of straight lines. Rule changes at every turn, they say follow the science without any consultation or debate. Science now is what the government leaders say it is. Having had the illness is the best defence from ever getting it again, but that‚Äôs not very profitable and if they can break down your natural immunity with a few jabs well you might just be the next casualty and that‚Äôs worth a few bucks.

2.0,"Hey Tucker, love your show but you got it wrong about Aussie bloke sneezing in lift. Remember TYPHOID MARY - they locked her up in isolation for 20 years because she refused to isolate. This bloke is contagious and refuses to quarantine or self isolate. So I have no problem with them locking him up in forced quarantine (comparison to FEMA camps etc is a bit silly, really. It is just 2 weeks isolation which many countries are enforcing, and if he cops a fine or jail term for breaking the law, so what). Yes our Govt is insane, but that's because, unlike most of the world, they are still aiming for ZERO COVID, which is rapidly slipping through their inept fingers. And high school kids were NOT forced to vaccinate without parents in a stadium - it was totally voluntary, and many opted to not vaccinate. There is enough crap going on in the world to expose, without hyping stuff up - it just diminishes your credibility. Disappointed, but still a big fan :)"

2.0,I wonder what would happen if we got the money out of politics.
2.0,"While corporate money in politics can be considered bribery, most of it is legal in the US. Many of these companies will fund anyone on committees that oversee their particular market, so just about every congressman, state or federal, gets political donations from big corporations, and if they are committee chairs or get lots of press, they get more, regardless of political affiliation, as long as that corporation feels they can expect preferential treatment access. Every bill is backed by congressmen who take corporate money. I doubt AT&T is donating to ban abortion specifically, they are likely donating to many state and federal-level stooges hoping they will regulate their industry in AT&T's favor. If those stooges also happen to be right-wing jack-asses? AT&T probably doesn't care."

2.0,"In what news have you heard is misinformation?

Also, if one is spreading misinformation, don't you believe is is better to just oust them with facts rather than go out and BAN them. I've seen many times someone banned for ""misinformation"" and ""hatespeech"" and when I read it myself it's a complete lie and unfair. In fact I consider them irrefutable at certain times. If one is so wrong surely it wouldn't be hard, certainly if you acknowledge it as wrong, you know the reasons yourself and can specify them for the public.

Especially with twitter who ban posts on covid they label as having a potentisl risk of spresding misinformation. By doing this they pretty much acknowledge people are incredibly credulous and naive. Otherwise why else would they ban it? Surely the individual could judge for themselves whether it is misinformation or not.

Besides. How do we reslly believe a corporation like twitter has our best interests?(As a citizen of America) They are openly are leftist and actively censor snd silence opposing views. Trunp is banned while we have terrorists like the Taliban alloud on there.

In my opinion they just censor opposing views because they know there is the fear of convincing them they(the poster) are right. In which they don't want that for propably some self centered reason or they want to maintain along with all other sources a monopoly on news with leftist indoctrination(Trans, LGTBTQ+, Feminist movement?, and whatever else. TV radio, sports, cartoons, movies and books.)

2.0,"Do you know how much an abortion at planned parent hood or some other abortion clinic is? Honest question I do not know. I found planned parent hood says it could be $0-$1,500. but I am not sure what other places charge, I know in a hospital it can be 5,000 or a bit more for vaginal birth or higher for C-section. How can any women really afford a abortion then or delivery period then? 

You talk about How does that (to put it bluntly) undestroy their body? or the trauma of childbirth? How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria.  Have you seen the side effects of both a hormonal pill abortion or a medical abortion? For hormonal pill, it is not unusual for a women having to go to the hospital because the bleeding does not stop, but continues to get worse. Some women become sick and mentally damaged seeing that amount of blood and the cells of the baby after cleaning up that mess, During the surgical abortion where they stick a vacuum up there, it is not unusual for the doctor to cause damage to the uterus and other organs that actuary harm the chance of having another baby in the future, along with bleeding, and causing tears that might need to be surgically fixed. So you will have to go to the hospital for surgery. which case is all traumatic in my opinion. and more of an economic burden now they have more bills to pay. (not saying vaginal birth or C-section is better they all have their risk too)

to your other argument, why cant an employer higher a temp from an agency? There are temp agency that people do sign up with to find part time work, they usually work part time or full time during a short period of work, do you think those short term workers would like to have that job for a bit?"

There are things, a few of them where Bolsonaro is right and on point, others show how ill-suited he is. With that being said, the options were even worse in the last elections.
The Supreme Court in brazil is the biggest joke there ever was, it needs to be completely reformed (The US supreme court should also be reformed, by the way)
The brazilians have a supreme court where ANY lawyer, appointed by a POLITICIAN can become a member, no need to be a judge, no need to be someone suited for the job, and that is a lifetime position! ANY supreme court that is unbiased and trustworthy need to be populated by FEDERAL JUDGES, appointe by election amongst all federal judges in the country, and I said JUDGES, not mere, ill-prepared lawyers. The political appointment process needs to be eliminated, and until it is so, no one will trust the courts. (that holds true in Brazil, US or any democracy).
Also, the voting issue, Bolsonaro is for electronic PLUS paper ballot, so it could be audited, similarly to the US...imagine an election where the electronic votes could not be audited? Yes, that is Brazil. But guess, the brazilian (comunists-inclined) opposition is against that. There is no transparency throughout society, and a society that has its powers opaque to its population, is a democracy of the rich and powerful, (like Russia, Belarus, China....and the list goes on) and all of these countries, including Brazil and US are heading that way unless structural changes are made....and those are usually painful.

Whom are often ignorant of what libertarianism is and want to be contrarian, or - and I contend, a large portion are made up of bots bad faith internet actors. Look at the Bernie subs and bizarre overlap with thedonald + redpill+ language).

Edit: this isn't to say Bernie voters are not real, I know plenty who were,  they just didn't act like or talk like what you see in those subs or online.  Most of the Bernie bros hate major portions of the internet (millennials) for security concerns.  At least, the ones I know irl."

2.0,"I was asked a question (that has been deleted) about ""what civ"" I'm ""proud"" of. Interesting question!

I was raised steeped in Western culture. Grandparents in the German film industry, photographer dad, actress mom. They taught me (some) German and French. Went to international school. Studied physics and medieval studies in a college with a Great Books program. 

I can't think of a better way to spend an afternoon than at the Met or MOMA. 

Am I ""proud"" of Beethoven and Mozart? I had nothing to do with them. I enjoy them, I love them, I am deeply moved by them. But pride implies personal achievement. Just look it up: 

1. feeling deep pleasure or satisfaction as a result of one's own achievements, qualities, or possessions or those of someone with whom one is closely associated.
""a proud grandma of three boys""
2. having or showing a high or excessively high opinion of oneself or one's importance.
""a proud, arrogant man""

I am quite proud of a short play I wrote that got a good review in the NY Times. It brought me to LA where I met my wife who was a TV writer. (Our little joke is that we met through the NY Times.)

I am proud of my father's work, with which I had little to do, but I helped him in the darkroom and changed his film sometimes. 

I work in the space program and I'm proud of that, though I'm in a support position and have nothing to do with designing or selecting missions.

But to be ""proud"" of Monet or Voltaire just seems bizarre to me. I love them and would defend them, and I'm deeply moved by them, and would be devastated if the works were destroyed. But pride doesn't enter into it."

2.0,"The problem is that Senators no longer stand and filibuster.  They send an email and go home. 

We need to return to the stand and talk filibuster.  When you sit, you quit. Then we vote."
2.0,"It‚Äôs not just Manchin and Sinema. 

Joe Biden also wants to keep the filibuster."
2.0,Agreed! A senate rule shouldn‚Äôt outweigh rights given under the constitution.
2.0,"Biden‚Äôs era of good governance is way behind us. His years in the senate are very different from what we‚Äôre seeing today. During Trump tenure, we‚Äôve seen a complete erosion of moderates and bipartisanship in congress. The guy is like a high school kid asking for his BFF to fight on his side. Biden can‚Äôt get his agenda passed, unless either Manchin and Sinema stop annoying us with their ‚Äúfilibuster is democracy‚Äù non sense, or republicans won‚Äôt use it to sabotage the democratic agenda."
2.0,"That was the so called nuclear option, and was voted in by democrats during the previous administration. Lets not make the same mistake again."

2.0,"They could‚Äôve gotten rid of the filibuster when they had slight control‚Ä¶but didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶.why?

Because they knew that getting rid of it would mean that every time the power structure changed, previous legislation could be undone with a simple majority."
2.0,"Sure, but you don‚Äôt use the nuclear option when convenient, for the simple fact, it overrules the filibuster."
2.0,Well... they actually are the ones who ended filibusters for supreme court justices.
2.0,"I won't be complaining, but to be fair I've completely given up on this shit hole country. We've got like 2 actually liberal senators, 52 conservatives, and 46 who are very concerned on Twitter. I'm just hopeful I can emigrate before it gets much worse."

Like if a Muslim believed just as fervently as a Christian did, don‚Äôt you believe they think their religion is the one true one just like they do?"
2.0,This literally sums up the trump presidency
2.0,">On 17 October, during a press conference, Trump was asked about his silence by a reporter and commented on the incident.

2.0,Good call. I try to pay attention to whataboutism but sometimes it's easy to miss.
2.0,How many republicans have attended trump rally‚Äôs after the election he lost.?

2.0,"Same.

Glad I served under a Commander in Chief that I respected."
2.0,"I think you're misinterpreting the ""it's fine Biden screwed up"" aspect, I don't get the impression he's being let off the hook. I can't blame anyone for continuing to highlight the previous administration's shortcomings in comparable situations to what the current one is being held brutally accountable for."
2.0,"You can interpret it that way if you want but I don't understand it that way. The title calls out the Republican hypocrisy for blasting Biden now while being fine with Trump back in 2017.

By that standard calling out the different reactions to similar situations aka hypocrisy is from now on always ""whataboutism"" and we will no longer be able to call out hypocrisy at all.

Also what is blasted here is neither the situation leading up to the events nor the failures that led to them but rather the reaction to them."
2.0,"dude isn't this post and entire context just Dems doing the same, i.e blasting trump back in 2017 and being fine with Biden now? You can change the text to ""Your reminder that when four American soldiers were killed in niger in 2017 Dems raised hell"" and title to ""Dems hypocrisy"" and post it on one of the conservative subs and it'll fit right in.

I've experienced political shithousry in other countries but it's on another level in the US, ~~politicians~~ actually more the supporters, of both sides do the same thing when their guy is not in power. They also do the same thing when your guy is in power. When trump was in t_d was all about obama and drone strikes and now all the dem subs are *but trump did worse*."
2.0,"It is exactly as you describe it. Whataboutism is bringing up something that you think was worse to make another mistake seem less bad.

I only disagree that this is the intention of this post. The intention is as I read it to make people remember how different republicans REACTED to the things Trump did wrong compared to how they react to Bidens mistakes now.

The huge difference to me is that the title attacks republicans for their hypocrisy and does not focus on whether Trump or Bidens mistakes were worse."
2.0,"I was never questioning the validity of the complaint, one way or the other. I was simply pointing out that it is the same tactic. Don‚Äôt you understand that the right also believe they are pointing out the hypocrisy of the left when they do it?"
2.0,"Do you not already do that?

It's how I warm up my clicking finger. Hop on YouTube, report hate speech, watch cat videos. Work done well."
2.0,"I don‚Äôt want YouTube to censor anything but those shouldn‚Äôt them up on my searches or recommendation unless I use ‚ÄúFox News‚Äù in the search box. YouTube promotes hate videos on my search that‚Äôs my problem, for PR they block bunch of videos but they allow most videos to appear on your searches. Tech companies has to fix the algorithm but they are scared it will affect the user activity on their app."
2.0,"I‚Äôve just stopped looking at YouTube‚Äôs news channels. The comments, no matter who‚Äôs in office, are full of whining babies I couldn‚Äôt care less about. They need to find something better to do rather than being pathetic losers who talk to the 10,000 other losers also trying to ‚Äòmake an impact?‚Äô about the political situation. I too watch Fox News for comedy. ~~F~~Tucker once started saying we should all identify as the opposite gender to break records and that shit was hilarious."
2.0,What exactly does Reich mean when he says Democrats need to wake up? Is he implying that there's reticence towards change and crushing these freaks? Reich is great but I expect a little more than just foot stomping and demanding the magic wand that doesn't exist. The only Democrats need to wake up about is freaking VOTING. The end.
2.0,They are making it legitimate by filing lawsuits. People follow news but never the actual hearings. US should have spent more on education and critical thinking programs in schools.

Click on ""Download the Party Platform"" and take a look at ours.

You have to be careful; your state group wants to kind of oversee what literature is put out. Simply because the Dem messaging should be consistent and fact-based. 

Are you working with your county party? Your County Chair should know what to do. Or your Congressional District Chair."
2.0,"Yes, that's exactly what you want to do. Facts and information about what Dems are doing and want to do.. not all negativity about Rs. 

What state are you in? You should be able to look at your state party platform. See what your party is doing at the state level and integrate that with info relative to your community."
2.0,Yes I reached out to my county parties chair to ensure we are getting something out. She agreed with my assessment and hadn‚Äôt realized how short we were on any kind of resource for the tables.

2.0,No.  This reminds me too much of my conservative friends talking about doing the same for California or New York.
2.0,So does that mean men do have a voice when it comes to abortion now? Or does that not compute?

2.0,I honestly cannot comprehend the depth of the insanity with these people. It really IS a mental illness.
2.0,even the devil realises human society is fucked
2.0,"Wait so it's no longer a women's issue because women don't exist. Meaning men CAN have a valid opinion on abortions. Suggesting otherwise suggests that trans men aren't real men.

It is transphobic to say men can't have an opinion on abortions."
2.0,I have no compassion for the ignorant.

2.0,"I'm pretty sure that in the human species ,the female is the only gender that can get pregnant."
2.0,"Wait, I don't understand. Someone please clarify.

Is she referring to Female -> Male trans people who still have the female sexual organs necessary to give birth? With the incomplete surgery techniques we have today, it is still possible to get pregnant after the surgery. Wouldn't they would fall into their own category instead of being called a traditional woman?

I don't know if that's what she means. Of course on the surface it looks completely ridiculous, but maybe the above is what she's thinking..?"
2.0,"That is true, I heard that people who speak English can get pregnant, that is a fact üòÇüòÇ"
2.0,So a man has control of his body a woman control of her body? Good to know!
2.0,"To Mrs. Gandy‚Äôs claim, this is true for male seahorses and perhaps some other species I‚Äôm not aware of, but this is not the case for humans.

  My guess is she‚Äôs using the scientific definition of gender while we‚Äôre using the legal definition which basically a polite way of saying sex."
2.0,Nope. Just the ones who will be getting the abortion. Full stop.

No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with covid 19. A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.‚Äù Merck is the company that created ivermectin."
2.0,"I guess that I am by definition a RINO given that I do vote Republican but only because they represent more of my positions than Democrats.  I'm pretty centrist politically speaking.  So, please pardon me if I'm not one of the folks this sub is supposed to be for.  But I just feel it necessary to point out how intellectually bizarre the rhetoric against Ivermectin is.

Now, I'm not an anti-vax guy.  I've had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine and have no problem getting a booster if it's necessary.  I was also one of the first people in my state to get COVID in March of last year.  But I respect everybody's choice about what to do with their own bodies.  I'm not taking a position against anyone's rights or decisions.  The point I'm making is solely to reveal what I believe to be an intellectual weakness in the anti-Ivermectin crowd's arguments.

The anti-Ivermectin crowd rails against it because it's ""not meant for humans"" and other similar arguments.  However, Ivermectin is FDA-approved for human use.  And do you know what is **not** FDA-approved?  **The vaccine.**  

So, here you have these people insulting your intelligence over the fact that some folks are taking a drug originally not meant for humans but that eventually became FDA-approved for human use and recognized as having legitimate, beneficial uses in humans.  But those same people are out there pushing crazy ideas like vaccine mandates and prison time if you don't get a substance shot into your arm that is **not** FDA-approved.  

I'm not usually one to just lay into somebody and call them dumb, but in this case, I think it's safe to say that many of these anti-Ivermectin people are, in fact, dumb.  At the very least, they fail to see the intellectual inconsistencies in their positions.  One can only assume that if those same people were diagnosed with a blood clotting disorder that they would refuse to allow a doctor to prescribe them Warfarin.  You know, since Warfarin is rat poison."
2.0,You may want to check Merck‚Äôs website in regards to ivermectin in regards to covid. They are the company that created ivermectin.

Look to the top 1% for funds. In return, bills and laws are passed that are more in line with corporations than in line with we the people. Our donations are petty and not enough for them. 

Our founding fathers warned us of a two party system. Its destroying our country.  Last time this country came together was/2001. There was no hate against race, religion and sex within America against  each other. that didn't matter. Now we cant even come together for a virus thats making millions of people sick making 10s of thousands of people die.

I would assume it extends variably to the rest of the country, but only speaking for my area, the major problem seems to be key industries not recovering fully hold back others. The biggest one I hear from prospects  is childcare. Many childcare facilities that existed pre-covid don't exist now. And the ones that do charge significantly more than they did before, because supply is low and demand is high, so they can easily. Everyone knows childcare is expensive, but when it goes up 30 or 50 or 100% or more over a year, many of the people who were working just dont make sense anymore unless they get a raise or a different job, and thats IF you can find one that can and will take your money. Theres waiting lists everywhere for childcare.

There's been a return somewhat to having a stay at home mom or dad in many families because working where they worked before is now negative money. Our economy has been used to having more adults in the labor force, as opposed to a single household earner. A return to that in any significant percentage easily continues the trend we are in now.

> People are tired of the working conditions and expectations that have developed, and have finally discovered their worth as employees, 

Financially you are only worth what someone else is willing to pay you. You don‚Äôt get to determine your own financial worth. Otherwise, I‚Äôd determine my financial worth to be $10 Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have any skills that are worth $10 therefore no one values my financial worth at $10  

> People want to be able to survive and be happy without having to kill themselves working 70 hours a week. 

Then get a new job. If working 70 hrs a week is not paying for your needs, you either need to reduce your expenses or get a higher paying job. A few years ago I was making I didn‚Äôt like making that little money. I decided I wanted to make more money. I went on google and looked up high paying jobs. I found one area  that was high paying that I was relatively interested in, and I googled what qualifications I needed to get one of those jobs. For this specific job, it was a specific college degree. Now it doesn‚Äôt have to be a college degree, for some high paying jobs it could be trade school, a software coding boot camp, a certification program, etc. But for this specific job, it was a specific college degree. I then decided to go to school to get this degree. It sucked, and between school and my job I was putting in 70-90 depending on the week. I had no life whatsoever for 4 years, and like I said, it sucked. But it was totally worth it. I now work in the industry that I had originally researched. 

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the pay for your current job, you need to get a higher paying job. In order to get a higher paying job, you need to acquire a skillset that people will be willing to pay you money for. Like I said above, this doesn‚Äôt have to be school, as school can be expensive. However, there are plenty of affordable ways to attend school, and I am perfectly happy to share these with you (or anyone else) if you care, and I would love to help. Regardless, trade schools and certification programs can also be great ways to increase your skillset. 

> Even people working 40 expect to make a reasonable wage and be valued as employees. 

Tbh 40 hrs a week really isn‚Äôt that much. At 8 hrs a day, 5 days a week, that‚Äôs literally of the day you don‚Äôt have to work, and you still have the weekend on top of that

> People want to be able to retire comfortably without having a $100k salary their whole life. People want to work to live, not live to work. 

You don‚Äôt need anywhere close to a salary for your whole life in order to retire comfortably. You can retire comfortably on far less (I guess it depends on what your definition of comfortable is). Again, if you (or anyone else) wants more information on how to do this, please let me know, or visit It‚Äôs really not difficult at all, and I‚Äôd love to help where I can.

Okay"
2.0,"Thanks for the reading suggestion.
I, too, have been skeptical about the financing method of UBI, and it's a semi absurd concept for me. Europe already has quite extensive basic income systems, but they are bound to conditions. A few countries have UBI test phases from time to time.
I think it's an interesting concept and am interested to see how it will work out.

I can somewhat relate to many if these topics, because i changed workplaces during lockdown for a job that sounded less prestigious on paper, but pay was significantly better, more time off, more benefits, less micromanagement, less pressure ""from above"". And that functions quite as well.
I understand you can't have all the benefits in every job, and sometimes you'll need minimum wage to mop up the floor or something, but everyone need to finde their niche where they can lead a fulfilling life."

2.0,"The problems with UBI as it has been marketed in the US, are twofold: 

1. They are talking about it as a replacement for Welfare - and the current welfare systems are far more lucrative for the recipients.  People will not voluntarily switch.  If forced to switch, they will riot.

2. Even in the amounts advertised, it can't be paid for in the US."

A lot of homeless just seem mental and desperately in need of help. I'm completely for getting these people off the streets it's fucking depressing and annoying. I don't think they deserve incarceration.

2.0,"The values of the house probably not by much if they do. But there will be a lot more houses on the market with foreclosures and people moving as they get new jobs or lose current ones. In 2020 no one could really move and start new jobs except for small number of cases. 2021 we see people start trying to get back to normal and we have shortages left and right which causes a supply and demand effect making my home 40% more valuable than it was the previous year. As more homes are on the market the supply goes up to meet the demand again so we could see a 5%-10% drop in value. 

Im not a financial expert by any means tho. Just some idiot on Reddit."

God loves you, man.

I strongly suggest reading the Gospel of John and Acts to see what Jesus teaches. It is so on point with what I am absolutely sure you believe to be moral, that you might even see that he's calling to you. All you have to do after that is ask him into your heart and believe he has been raised.

2.0,"If you took 200 billion from Bezos and just handed it out to all US citizens, it would be about $600 per person, one-time.  It wouldn't change anything drastically.  The scale of government spending is so far beyond the ultra wealthy it's obscene.  My point is the ultra wealthy are not the problem or the solution.  They're an inevitable result of a global economy in my view.  They aren't necessarily evil or good, but one thing that's pretty universal is that they have changed the world on a global scale.

The exception to the above being when special interests and lobbyists are pushing policy not in our best interest with billionaire dollars driving policy.  We used to call that corruption or at least a conflict of interest or ethics violation.

I have no idea how to fix it, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, so hold my beer:

1) Remove the power and money from DC by drastically decreasing federal spending and returning power to the states.  I'm thinking decentralization of this power makes it harder to corrupt and more accountable to the people.

2) Cryptocurrency may be a game changer.  I'm sure with its own set of unforseen consequences.


I don't know what the numbers are currently, but Biden was proposing something like 10 trillion in spending over the coming years.  For my household, of which, I'm the only income earner, if we naively just divide 10 trillion by 330 million citizens, then multiple by the number in my household, that's about 150,000 the government is spending of my earnings, on my behalf.  The reality is worse, because the bottom 50% aren't effectively paying federal income tax (though of course they pay other taxes).  I'm sorry, I have better things to spend on than supporting bloated, inefficient government.  That's only proposed new federal spending, I already pay property tax, sales tax, gas tax (presumably for 'infrastructure'), local income tax, state income tax, medicare, social security, and the corporate taxes, etc built into the good we buy.

All things considered, the bureaucrats are probably really close to controlling more of the wealth we produce than we are.  I am not against all taxes, but the way I see it the bureaucracy in DC is effectively a parasite which is bleeding us dry with debt and wasteful spending.  I don't know where all that money goes, but I'm certain obscene amounts are being wasted or even being spent on causes directly opposed to the interests of the citizens paying for this mess."

2.0,Biden recently put some visa restriction on people involved in the current genocide against the Tirgray and Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia.

Pompeo and Inhofe are lobbying on behalf of the Ethiopian and Eritrean government in opposition to Biden and most of congress.
2.0,"The sad fact is that the narrative of ""Tigray Genocide""  has successfully reached the international audience, despite the facts on the ground.

* Cause of war was the Nov 4th attack by the TPLF (Tigray People's Liberation Front) - the ousted former ruling party of Ethiopia for over 30 years (BAD DUDES).
* Amharas have been ethnically cleansed from many areas  (Wollega, Mai Kadra, Chena, Agmasa, etc...)
* TPLF using Child Soldiers to continue their crusade in Afar & Amhara regions.

Yet TPLF has rebranded it's name (in name only) to TDF)and cries genocide while killing civilians of all ethnicities (Crocodile tears). 

In Ethiopia, there are 80+ ethnicities. Yet, TPLF (The Tigray Rebels) are literally the only faction which is actually using ethnicity as a target - yet you probably don't hear these narratives."
2.0,The MSM has [posted]( about the atrocities committed in Ethiopia.
2.0,"Unfortunately, you'll hear 2 stories and it's mostly divided on ethnic lines and allegiance.

If they're from Tigray (most likely but not universal) will tell you that story you shared.

Ethiopia has 80+ Ethnicities, but one political group (from Tigray) is trying to make a comeback after being ousted from power - after 30 years of being the ruling party. The TPLF is not a small guy - it's literally a political group that has used Racism to divide Ethiopia.

TPLF's aim is to make itself look like the good guy using it's operatives across the world. They are a rich & extremely corrupt group that got the boot due to a popular uprising.

Democracy has emerged; and ethno nationalism (their bread & butter) is under threat.

Imagine having the US dividing states based on ethnic lines (like This is for Whites Only, This is for Blacks Only, etc...) That's who they are... racism is a political opinion in their mind :)

Here's a joke

* Republican talks about race... they're a racist
* TPLF kills, borders & imprisons based on race... they're a fledgling democracy

I understand why my opinion may not matter to you, because this is your country, not mine. And I respect that. I have always respected Americans for their patriotism.

It's also absolutely fine to discuss different opinions. Mine, for instance, is that an American president should be more mindful of his behavior. Yours may be different.

2.0,"Yes I agree, and I don't like it.

That being said, it's been far easier for me as a nuclear advocate to convince a right winger to support nuclear power than to have a left winger support nuclear.

The left bludgeoned the right with emotional appeal and NIMBYism to shut down our stance on nuclear in the general public, meaning that the only options left if you knew solar and wind wouldn't do anything would be to either be silent and keep voting... Or throw your hands in the air. It's so easy to bring right wing republicans who don't believe in climate change back to believing in reasonable stances on environmentalism as long as A) it's incremental and B) you validate their concerns. Same thing I've done with most topics.

And, to be honest, if the right says don't spend money and not solve the problem, and the left says spend more money on something that won't solve the problem... I think not spending money is still a better option.

It's so irritating if you look at it and see how the the nuclear regulatory commission called a lot of the anti nuclear attacks ""leftist trash"" all the way back in the 80s. If they let us keep going we would have been like France and this wouldn't have been an issue."
2.0,"As a hard left winger, yeah yeah I know, not supposed to post, I actually agree with your stance on nuclear and also support nuclear power. I really think the energy generation stuff is a problem on both sides... with dumb republicans talking about bringing back coal as a major energy source, and dumb people on my side shutting down ideas like nuclear as efficient ways of generating clean energy.

The problem with don't spend money and don't solve the problem is no steps are being made towards solving the problem. Not saying spending money is great, but it can at least create progress to a solution if well managed.

Now whether you think the left can manage it well is of course a valid concern... I also believe government is wasteful and stupid in many situations after all."
2.0,"To be fair, I‚Äôm somewhat left leaning and super into nuclear.  It‚Äôs not a lost cause.  I actually find a lot of the older more conservative men who don‚Äôt know much about nuclear are the ones still quite nervous about it!"
2.0,"Hey man, in this polarized time I'm happy to find common ground. One of my best friends since I moved to GA is a traditional auth left guy, and when we have to talk politics that's our common ground we loop back to.

It is true both sides have their derps, we just need to reel them in. I remember being 'shut down' by someone on the left calling me a climate change denier because I said renewables can't fill our energy needs.

And I get that nothing is being done if you do nothing... But sometimes if you're given two shitty options I'd rather we do the least shitty one. 

As an example, let's say we told two people to each pick up a cinder block and carry it 100m east. If one person is fiddling with the block and then walking 30m south, and the other is kind of sitting there... That would mean the person sitting there is putting us in a better position.  That's how I view it; if we spend ungodly sums of money in renewable tech that won't solve the problem were essentially wasting money. Don't get me wrong, I think the gov should be, in general, supporting tech advancements... But we need to prioritize. If we took half the renewable funds and gave it to the scientists and engineers trying to make  nuclear stations cheaper or faster to construct, it would have actually made a dent.

Cheers to finding common ground, from a right winger to a left winger!"

Most libs I know are in favour of a *diverse* energy economy.  More wind, yes. More solar, yes. Nuclear additions, yes. nationally refined oil products, yes.  Not everyone left wing is ultra progressive, just like not everyone right wing is alt-right extreme. There‚Äôs a middle ground somewhere with a lot of overlap on these issues."
2.0,"In the documentaries I‚Äôve watched, the ‚Äòmajor‚Äô accidents have been due to negligence.   I‚Äôm definitely open to links citing otherwise, however, it‚Äôs my understanding that Chernobyl for example was a direct result of plant management ignoring power source protocols and straight up causing an avoidable disaster (trying to cover it up obviously didn‚Äôt help) and 3 mile island for another example, was the result of a leak that was not registered by any sort of sensor or properly maintained and was an entirely avoidable incident in itself as well.  Sadly, communication technology wasn‚Äôt at the level it has been at for the last couple decades to lead to faster, more experienced troubleshooting either.  Both examples are tragic and damaging to the psyche, but, when studied, the argument of how dangerous they are lessens as the argument for human error grows."

You owe it to your American family members that fell at places like Gettysburg, Normandy and Iwo Jima. ¬†You owe it to your current American family and to family members not yet born and whom you will never see but most importantly, you owe it to yourself.

You are now facing the strongest opponent to American freedom that America has ever known and the odds of survival seem long. ¬†How did we succeed in the past against tyranny, oppression and assault?¬†

Some might say that we sent our former family members into battle with the best technology and resources available and they would be partly right. ¬†But our true strength has always resided in our steadfast faith in God. ¬†Our belief that our cause was just and that it was by God‚Äôs hand that we would prevail. ¬†

Let us renew that trust and faith and accept the promise of help in dark times. ¬† Let us unleash the greatest power in creation and call upon our creator to help us in the shadow of what seems to be the death of our Republic. ¬†One nation under God and in God we trust is the cornerstone of this nation.¬†

And so on Wednesday, July 8th let all God loving members of the American family and across the globe unite in prayer that first begins by acknowledging that without Jesus Christ we can do nothing and with Jesus Christ all things are possible for His glory. That in our own words we ask for guidance and direction to do our part in restoring the founding principals of this nation. ¬†And if inclined to do so, share those prayers with others by posting on YouTube. ¬† (Please share this message)"

Let me check my memory and I see there was another government entity in the last millennium ¬†that was also UN-ELECTED and served for their entire life, that‚Äôs right, a KING. History tells us what our founding fathers thought of such a government entity when they gave King George V a big ‚ÄúF ¬†you‚Äù when they signed the Declaration of Independence. Today we have ¬†a Supreme Court that is governing just like a king, using judicial decrees to make law, a form of judicial activism that has no legitimate place in the highest court of the land. If the Supreme Court wants to become a political entity of our three branches of government, of which in my opinion they have firmly established with their recent rulings, then they should be subject to the same process as the other two branches, the legislative and executive, and that is an ELECTION. No longer should Supreme Court justices be nominated by the president and then approved by the senate. These justices should be elected by the people through a national election, like any other political entity in a DEMOCRACY."

2.0,"I hope people aren't stupid enough to try to copy this. At no point was that guy actually in control of that situation. The only reason he wasn't immediately arrested is because the cop happened to be a laid back guy and decided to be patient and let him run his mouth. If anyone, white or black tried that with 99% of cops they would be in cuffs instantly. This cop is just one of the few relaxed ones out there."
2.0,Thumbs to both the cop and the citizen!

2.0,Washington state laws have different regulations for marked and unmarked vehicles.  Marked patrol vehicles are subject rules for decals and markings. Unmarked vehicles are not subject to the same rules. Just because the officer wasn't aware of the law doesn't mean the citizen was correct about the interpretation.
2.0,I'm wondering how the guy got the cop to pull over! I'm surprised the cop didn't just flip him off and speed off lol.
2.0,Why‚Äôd he feel the need to add the whole extra part about ‚Äúif it was a black guy‚Äù like wtf

2.0,"I agree with Jayar. Here in the UK one of our most famous Olympians - a household name - got pulled in a nice car and asked where he stole it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm white & educated and have been arrested once, when much younger, and refused to sign a statement written by the arresting officer because it was equivocal - I got a blank look back and told him to find a senior officer and a dictionary. I deserved a smack really, but I absolutely know that if I‚Äôd been less well educated I‚Äôd have signed the statement and ended up in trouble, and can‚Äôt imagine what kind of hell I‚Äôd have landed in had I been anything other that white & middle class. 
We‚Äôre so lucky here that the police are not routinely armed, but we still have accidents‚Ä¶ famously a Brazilian tourist was shot in the Underground and a man carrying a table leg under a blanket(?) but that‚Äôs all that I remember in a few decades‚Ä¶"

2.0,"Gary needs to get a life. We need to hold cops accountable but harassing cops is not appropriate.

2.0,"Wow this happened in my state!? I hope this goes nationwide. And in our state it would have gone against the cop if he would have tried to protest. Also as a woman this how we've wound up raped or worse.
Looked up this guy. He is currently a fugitive from justice because it tried to interfere with a trial in Washington state by acting as the defendents attorney despite not having a law license.  He and his wife have fled to Mexico where our ambassador says he is behaving like a spoiled brat because he picks and chooses what laws of theirs he will obey. He insists their cops speak to him in English, he won't observe their Covid19 rules because he doesn't believe in Covid19. Oh yeah he believes in conspiracy theories and is a Libertarian."

2.0,"I'm proud to say i did something similar. I followed a speeding canine unit concerned that it was driving erratically and posing a  danger to other motorists without any lights blaring, and he finally pulled over. A young cop emerged and looked at my ID and asked me why i was following him. I said, ""you were going 100 and cutting people off with no lights."" I also said, ""You are the worst driver i've ever seen."" He let me go and as far as i could see he drove more carefully after that."

Then there are bible basher's who go out of their way to judge people openly on things like dress sense. Logan is the bible basher. If someone like him approaches you, just sit there and ignore him. Keep chatting to those you went to the venue with, or if you are alone & have a radio, turn it on & drown them out. (Make sure you only take a cheap radio to the beach. One you can afford to lose, in case they attempt to destroy it.)"

2.0,If the creator of life and master of the universe wanted us to follow a set of rules or guidelines on how we should live our lives then why speak in parables that only cause confusion and are subject to each person‚Äôs interpretation of what those words mean?

2.0,"gosh, all the Taliban jokes became so real with that last clip. That man wants to hold all women responsible for his own weaknesses. 
I know adulting is hard, but if you want freedom, you have to learn to be responsible....jeez"
2.0,So young girls in bikinis üëô üëô at the beach triggered your porn addiction. So to satisfy your self-serving perversion you approached these young women under the guise of Christ. Then because your fiance had on that wack a$$ Wonder Woman outfit you're mad? Allegedly! The only difference between them and his fiance is her bottoms. But she is showing her skins none the less. You girls should be ashamed of yourselves making him go home and watch pornüòÇüòÇüòÇ

2.0,"How does someone who has full sleeve tattoos have the balls to tell others that they cannot find worth in their body?  Especially when he wears a shirt that specifically shows off those tattoos.  Oh right, because the whole argument is bullshit.  Another attempt to remove body autonomy.

2.0,"I'd have told him that God created Adam and Eve naked and the beach provides us with an opportunity to get closer to our original state in Paradise. This guys previous job in his previous life was handing out fig leaf's in the Garden of Eden. I'd have called up a photo on my phone of Michaelangelo's Sistine Chapel frescoes as soon as he invoked the name of God. For devout Michaelangelo, the purest expression of divinity is found in the perfection of the naked human form. Unfortunately, the leaders of the Catholic Church were even more uptight about nudity than this guy: they commissioned other artists to paint clothes over the original figures nudity."
2.0,"When I was a kid some gigantically fat, gross woman told me I had to leave a public pool because I was upsetting young children because of my leg (I am an amputee). She even put her hands on me to physically force me to leave the pool area, at which point the life guards (and letter the police) got involved. 
     Never mind that I had every right to use the pool and had paid to be there.
     Also, I have been an amputee for 48 years now (since I was 3) and yea, little kids are sometimes scared, but mostly they are curious. If I can talk to them (always with parents permission) they stop being scared right away.
     When I worked at a resort I was swimming laps on my day off when I saw a little girl, about 4 with my fake leg trying to give it to her terrified looking dad.
    The kid was German and was trying to tell her dad, ""Daddy, someone for got their leg. You need to find them and give it back before they fall over.""
    Dad was thinking, ""Oh god, my kid has found someone's prosthetic leg and is playing with it. What should I say if the owner sees this?""
    Well his nightmare had come true. The owner had seen it, but thought it was hella funny.
    Though the child spoke only German, and I spoke only English the father, once he realized I was not upset was happy to translate.
     I was able to tell the child about my leg through her father. The kid was extremely sweet. After I explained about my leg and got her to put it back, she said something and patted my head (I was in the pool at this point) that caused her dad to laugh. She had said, ""You poor man. Not only is your leg gone, you can't even talk.""
     I have a huge amount of experience with children. It doesn't hurt them to see disabled people."

Because of her sins, a group of men were going to throw stones at her. Jesus basically said, if you haven't done ANYTHING wrong in your life, then you can cast a stone at her. But each one dropped their stone & walked away. I would like to see if other women down the beach, were dressed the same way as the girls, and if he reacted to same way to them."
2.0,Segura in the interview tells joe that  he got the vaccine because his cousin who is infectious diseases expert admitted to him is the best choice then rogan does a stink face.

2.0,"Dr Andrew Hill's post may have been referring to a ""study"" published by the Front Line Medical Care Alliance. Earlier this week, a judge prevented Dr Wagshul, the guy who runs that shit-show, from prescribing Ivermectin to a Covid patient."
2.0,Ana is triggered that Joe never invites her or any of the tyt clowns on his podcast. Big suprise nobody likes moronic SJWs
2.0,"He's making a questionable cause lagical fallacy, he is using correlation and implying causation, when some people don't even get symptoms from the virus that's some fairly sloppy thinking."
2.0,Joe Organ sure took a lot of drugs for a disease that ‚Äúisn‚Äôt that harmful‚Äù
2.0,I used being vaccinated. That and garlic. Hmm... it looks like I am fine without Ivermectin. Joe Rogan is just some punk who got lucky and survived. Wait until next strain. We will see if he survives that round.
2.0,why don't everybody have access to monoclonal antibodies? What's the reason? Are there people who are more important than others?
2.0,Joe Rogan living proof that comedians are not philosophers and you don't have to be smart to be funny
2.0,I have watched this pandemic since in began and doctors have said how it tricks people because they naturally get better for a couple of days and then they go down hill fast.......Has Rogan been 'well' for sometime now or only a couple of days?
2.0,"Please Ana, by all means go talk to him on his show line Cenk did. Engage in a healthy disagreement that may educate how both sides think about it. You debated Tomi Lahren. Why not just be a guest? Not a bad idea for some attention to both points of view."
2.0,"I listened to a couple episodes of Joe Rogan's podcast a couple months ago while at work. Wanted to see what all the hype around this guy was. I really only knew him from the sitcom ""Newsradio"" and ""Fear Factor"", time killers on NBC back in the day. So I listened, and his interviews where serviceable, and he had no great insight into anything with his commentary. Like most of his show was pleasant enough background, but the level his listeners think he's so smart and the $100 million dollar is baffling. Like he wasn't even a good entertainer really. Like Rush Limbaugh was a horrible man, but his show could be entertaining, and he was a brilliant broadcaster, if not a great commentator who would often say horrific things. However he could stretch nothing into hours of content. Rogan doesn't even have that going for him. So, basically, I don't get this guy at all. However, on a larger scale, he has gotten dangerous and Spotify needs to pull his contract."
2.0,Was he vaccinated
2.0,"Either way he got better WITHOUT THE VACCINE !!!............And weren't they telling people that antibiotics just don't work at all in the beginning ??? So, there's no need in even thinking about taking'em.... They were suppressing and bad mouthing  just about everything(even vitamins ) last year that was Not a wearing a mask or waiting for vaccine ...."
2.0,You guys all thought that Joe would die and were rooting for it because it would fit your narrative of ‚Äúvaccines for everyone‚Äù. You were wrong. Vaccines are only for those with comorbidities. He got over this virus in ONE day with no vaccine. Lol.
2.0,Rogan is such an impressionable baby. At this point it seems malicious or it's because he is self-selecting the only doctors who agree with this Ivermectin BS. Data is out there. Read it or shut up
2.0,"His doctor advised him to take it you nimwats, crazy how TYT's content is aligned with CNN's, MSNBC etc, watch the video his doctor advised him, it helped him. he never told people to take it"
2.0,"I think the other point is, he is constantly claiming that people like him with no comorbidities  and are healthy are fine. 

So why does he need intervention?  It‚Äôs just a cold isn‚Äôt it? 

He accidentally shown that deep, deep down, he doesn‚Äôt believe it."
2.0,"I mean people can try to use  Ivermectin for covid. And if it doesn't work, they can curse joe rogan on their deathbed lol"
2.0,Guess ana and cenk won't be on his show anytime soon
2.0,"Z pac, the antibiotic, will do absolutely nothing against a virus. 
REAL doctor‚Äôs are actually strongly against prescribing antibiotics for anything other than a bacterial infection, because it can cause antibiotic resistance when used when it‚Äôs not needed. 
Yeah, way to go Joe, treat a viral infection with an antibiotic. 
Idiot. üòµ‚Äçüí´"
2.0,"I have been calling out Kulinski and Talking Points for not calling out ""their boy"". I just saw Saagar back the fool up! ""F**k MSM!""? If they won't call Rogan out, who will?! ""Duh, Duh, it was a duh"". I used to give Kulinski some creditability but the ""synergy"" between him and Talking 'Pints' idiocy has me wondering."
2.0,"The real problem with Ivermectin is that it only cost about 2 cents a pill‚Ä¶
along with vitamin D (study after study has shown the lower your vitamin D status the harder this virus hits you) there is simply no money to be made.
Shame on you TYT for not doing your job as journalists and buying into the world of big pharma
the WHO says Ivermectin is one of the safest drugs on the planet and could easily be given out to people waiting for a vaccine‚Ä¶the problem is tho if you give people cheap drugs and they get the virus and don't get that sick, they might feel like they don‚Äôt need the vaccine‚Ä¶only money to lose if you promote something cheap, even if it ‚Äúhelps‚Äù
You say that there are no studies‚Ä¶let me ask you this, if you were sick how ethical would it be to withhold a medication that might save your life? Would you participate in such a study?

2.0,"WHERE WILL YOU GO WHEN YOU DIE? 

What day will it happen? Today? Tomorrow? 

One hundred and fifty thousand people die every day. How many of them were ready?

When you stand before God on that day will you go to heaven or hell? 

Jesus Christ tells us that unless you‚Äôre born again you will not see the kingdom of God. You will be judged for your sins; all of the lies, the immoral thoughts, stealing, blaspheming and justly sentenced to hell.

But you don‚Äôt have to go to hell. Jesus Christ tells us that whosoever repents of their sins and trusts in him can be saved. Jesus paid the penalty of your sins on the cross at Calvary two thousands years ago. 

What sin is worth an eternity in hell? Think how precious your eyes are to you, what would it take to sell your eyes? And how much for valuable the soul that looks out of those eyes? Don‚Äôt go to hell, repent and trust in Jesus and be saved."
2.0,"Z-pac is some dangerous s***! Doctors don't clue you in on this, wipes out your body's microbiome, causes liver damage, way too strong of an antibiotic!"

2.0,Take care TYT !! Jo is suing CNN & only right. TYT next !!!
2.0,I'm sure it was the horse meds and not all the other shit he took that was actually proper meds for covid. lol
2.0,I would of been a little more on board with the ivermectin claim until he mentioned the doctor who prescribed it. I forget the name of the group the doctor is part of I think it's Frontline c19 doctors or some crap but the get major kick backs. Doctors can be bad people too.
2.0,If you listened to his podcast you might have heard him say he already had his medical treatment in place if he caught covid. That wasn't panicking. As for the vaccine it is not a cure all. Evidence now points to it offsetting the worst effects of covid but you will need a booster 6 months after your second vaccination given it is now proven that it's efficacy drops to 40% after that initial period
2.0,Lol why you piss off at him for his own opinion. His body his choice . Not like your beloved vaccine does anything to treat the virus. In fact the virus is not even deadly enough to spend this much effort to deal with.
2.0,I'm no fan of this abortion law. But this is concerning that parts of the country are officially deciding to effectively put sanctions on other parts of the US. I barely even like it when we sanction foreign countries ffs.

2.0,Even though Texas ranks is the number ninth it slowly catching up to California because California is starting to feel the pinch of the pandemic since California lives off of borrowed money it's not really going to last long for the state which is why so many Californians left California for Texas. I don't like this reference but they called Texas the Western version of China in the US. I doubt the state would even notice Portland at all.
2.0,I have been married in two states. Texas and Indiana. On both my marriage applications there is a question that ass are you at least second cousins? That is an actual question on the application. When I asked about it I was told it‚Äôs a old law that you have to be at least second cousins to be married in Texas. I seen the same question on my Indiana marriage license application.

The Capitol was cleared of rioters, and later that evening, Congress returned and, as expected, the fire for finding the problem had burned out, as the ""deep state"" planned it. There are videos of Capitol Police waving the protestors onto the Capitol lawn and into the building. According to some, facial recognition software has identified ""Antifa"" members in the rioting crowd. As they did in the summer riots, normally peaceful people were antagonized by the anti fascists and followed along. The end result was attained... justifying the means. Debate stopped and Biden was certified by unchallenged slates of electoral votes. The Georgia challenge and the few challenges that came afterward received overwhelming votes against and the electoral protest procedure was halted in tis tracks. Not unexpectedly, there were soon calls from the left for V.P. Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the POTUS... and if he doesn't agree, we will start impeachment proceedings. The ""deep state"" has tried for 4 years to remove Donald J. Trump from office an they will not stop... even 12 days before the end of his term. ""He is dangerous!"", they say. ""He incited a riot!"", they say. The truth is, that with the intelligence that he still has access to... he is a threat to their illegal livelihood and has been for 4 years. It scares them to death that their truths may be revealed. For the left and the deep state, it is truly a matter of life and death to remove Trump. As Hillary Clinton said, (paraphrased), ""If that S.O.B. gets elected, we'll all hang by nooses."" Truer words were never spoken. Donald Trump was not as vindictive as he should have been, and he allowed them to slide. BIG MISTAKE!!!! A majority of the left and a goodly portion of the right are involved in enriching themselves from activities that are surely less than above board in the USA. They all fear the consequences. Some would surely face death for their crimes. We can only pray that justice will be served."

2.0,"The Redskins can avoid the racist charge by changing their mascot to a Redskin Potato! :-)

Many teams have aggressive names: the Bears, the Bengals (tigers), the Eagles, etc.  In a similar vein, the name Redskin was chosen because American Indians were viewed as tough warriors.  It was really intended as a compliment.

The people claiming that Redskins is a racist term have not been able to find a single documented instance of the term Redskins being used in a derogatory manner since the 1920s.  It's doubtful there is single person alive who has heard the term Redskins used as a racial slur.  The meanings of a word sometimes changes and the word Redskins is one such word.  Redskin hasn't been a slur in at least a century."

2.0,Gary Clark of the Washington Redskins conducted at least 3 football camps at Native American reservations during his career. He wanted to know if they thought the Redskins name was racist.

2.0,"""Liberals, progressives, Democrats and other rational thinkers must accept one crucial reality if they are to save America's democracy: Those who live in the right-wing echo chamber really do believe what they are being told. Those beliefs are now extensions of their core identities...

And as anyone who's watched Fox knows, its fundamental message is rage at what liberals are doing to our country. Over the years the specific message has changed with the times ‚Äî from terrorism to open borders to Benghazi to Christian cake bakers to critical race theory ‚Äî but it's always about what liberal politicians are doing to cripple America, usually with a large dose of thinly veiled racism to give it emotional heft...

The Fox pipeline is pretty simple. Fox News stokes a constant sense of outrage among its base of viewers, largely by highlighting narratives of white resentment and threats to Christianity. This in turn forces Republican politicians to follow suit. It's a positive feedback loop that has no obvious braking system, and it's already radicalized the conservative base so much that most Republicans literally believe that elections are being stolen and democracy is all but dead if they don't take extreme action."" - Unknown"

The hold you will live your eternal life in, it is not lined with gold and silver and all your precious stones, houses, camps, boats, 3 wheelers and 4 wheelers and your big boats!!! no no, they are not.

Do you know what love is? Have you ever experience the love of the Lord in your life, your kids lives, your wife's life, your family? The love of money is the root of all evil.....What do you plan to do with the wealth that God has entrusted you with? Do you plan to share it with people in the love of God or your love? Because if it is not the love of God, that love is fake and a lie. Choose this day whom you will serve, the God of the wealth and famous or Jehovah God? Foe me, whether what I have, I will serve My Jehovah God with everything. How about you?

I agree with your overall message, but be careful with statements like this.  This only serves to stir up anger and controversy, and derails any chance for constructive dialogue.  

For one, caucasians are way too broad of a group.  You wouldn't say blacks have a lot of blood on their hands after what happened in Rwanda.

Secondly, it's not right to pass the responsibility of a previous generation's actions onto the next.  No one should feel guilt or shame just because of the color of their skin.

The point should be to recognize and accept our history so that we can learn from the mistakes of those that came before us."

2.0,"The view you hold of white privilege is one I held for a long time.  What it isn't saying is that white people have easy lives or no problems or an automatically easier life than people of color.  Unfortunately, that's how some people talk about it.

I grew up white in a small, poor, rural, farming town.  Lots of meth, lots of poverty, things were bad.  There was a lot of resentment to the idea of white privilege because, as you say, there are lots of levers and dials on how privileged someone is.  

White privilege is the truth that, if one of those people were black, their life would be harder and they would have to deal with more issues than they do currently.  It ISN'T taking away or minimizing what those people are going through.  It is acknowledging race is one of the bigger levers in the equation."
2.0,"Cryptocurrencies have no legal basis.  The Constitution places sole authority over currency in Congress - not in Elon Musk, not in some mysterious Japanese man with his Chinese coin mining facility. 

Do you even know why we have devaluation in the dollar?  Do you know how fiat currency actually works and the global coordination of currency markets?  

We had moderate to mild inflation for several decades until Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1970, which crashed the economy throughout the 70s.  Yet, we still managed to have no carry over debt for programs - even Vietnam.  But in the 70s, we started borrowing money like crazy from Japan, to the point where  a minister of education suggested we cede Hawaii to them in exchange for writing off the debt. 

Carter used monetarism to increase inflation significantly which lowered the value of the dollar to repay the Japanese their dollar indexed funds.  This decrease the amount we owed them by billions of dollars.  Yes, stagflation: double digit interest rates, double digit inflation and double digit unemployment.  Short term pain (like 8 years) for long term gain of not carrying foreign debt. 

But Congress couldn't control its spending, and decided to leverage the funds in social security instead.  Throughout the 80s and 90s that's where we borrowed from thus increasing the total debt.  Various members of Congress then opined mightily about the impending crash of Social Security and that it should be privatized, like Chile did.  Except, Chile's program crashed and burned. 

We've been borrowing money for 40 years.   Mysterious, uncontrolled digital currency won't change anything other than create yet another ponzi scheme where the people who get in first, profit and the people who get in late lose money.   With no transparency and no accountability - that's what crypto is: it's a Ponzi scheme."

Of course do your own due diligence, I too wouldn't have suspected her until I started seeing references to this across many crypto news sites. I'm not saying that regulation doesn't need to be there, I'm just saying doomsayer democrats regarding cryptocurrencies will drive Republicans to take advantage of the narrative as being the ""free financial"" party. Granted, that's probably 10 to 20 years down the road, but politics is always a long game played like it's short."
2.0,It already is one gigantic Ponzi scheme right now in which WS and Musk are pushing.
2.0,"I don't really care what percentage of democratic or republican I am. I don't subscribe to the idea that I need to be either or. Ultimately you impress upon me the validation for that, with that kind of gatekeeping rhetoric. 

What I am saying, is I watch historical trends and compare them to current events. It might not happen, but the current dialogue of in office political figures is that it's a growing concern and lines in the sand will soon be drawn. What Ultimately will help people who are pro crypto vote for a specific political party is where their stance on crypto is."
2.0,My concern is the backing. There isn't a treasury or standard backing the currency. Theoretically I see it as kids honoring monopoly money
2.0,"Firstly, I want to say thank you for being kind and respectful. I knew this post would be met with ire and aggressiveness. 

But to your point of backing, our current USD isn't backed by anything other than the trust and psychological agreedness that it equals x amount. Money is an arbitrary meaning just like lines in the dirt mean that a country, ""exists"" there. Granted, symbolism is EXTREMELY valuable. Symbolism has been used for great evil and great good. 

My point ultimately is, doomsayers leave room for others to take up the mantle as champions of the crypto space."
2.0,"That actually isn't correct.  The dollar is backed by the US Government.   It's fiat around the world with more than 20 countries that use it as their currency. 

As one of the dominant currencies in global currency baskets, mismoves by Congress or the Federal Reserve can have catastrophic global consequences.    

About crypto?  Who owns it?  Who oversees it?  Nobody  We see Elon Musk quite reliably pumping Dogecoin with a few weeks at the end of his fiscal quarter, and then dumping it a week after the books close.  

Bitcoin is heavily used by terrorists around the world for ransomware.  The mythical value is the anonymity, yet governments are showing success at seizing wallets used for crime.    Speaking of criminal terrorists, North Korea is one of the leading countries that use crypto for criminal activity.

If you lose all value in your crypto, the way it has happened to many people - who do you deal with to get partial indemnification or a refund?

Nobody.  Nobody.  This is exactly the model that caused multiple financial collapses in the United States from 1830 through 1880.  Five complete financial collapse, bank runs and depressions that lasted for years. 

Because of these collapses, we created the Federal Reserve to oversee currency and debt.  The closest we've come to a collapse was 2008 because of speculative investments.  Sound familiar?  That cost us more than $1 trillion to bring under control.

We have the FDC which exists to oversee financial institutions to protect consumers in the event of a collapse.  No crypto is FDC backed, meaning - a collapse in any crypto leaves it's investors without recourse, and no government backing means they'll never see a cent of it again.

That's why we don't support crypto  It's the subprime mortgage of financial instruments."
2.0,"My point exactly, USD is backed by the conglomerate agreedness that the US government will catch us if we fall. Just because USD is backed by the government doesn't make it's value any less psychological. 

If I say, my rock is more valuable because 1000 people find it valuable, does it make it any more valuable than the 500 people who think their rock has more value? Inherently no, because they both have psychological value not actually valuable. 

People made the same argument when we made the move away from gold backed USD. A new medium of exchange is necessary for a global economy to evolve. Using the empire of the United states of America as a basis for a financial system globally won't work forever."
2.0,"Unfortunately this is typical absolutism. The USD is run through every world nation and backed by 20 governments and trillions of dollars, and losses can be compensated.

Crypto *runs* based on wide psychological trust which you try to present as similar, but the scale is not even close. Further, Crypto is not backed by anybody. Lost wallets are not redeemed, stolen data, fraudulent exchanges can not be fought. When Bitcoin had its big early pop and exchanges promised to refund you in their shop's virtual currency rather than dollars, there was nothing you could do."
2.0,If nobody wanted to value the USD that'd be insane as economies would collapse but in the end the US Treasury would honor it. Not so with your rock.

2.0,"That doesn't seem true. 

If they were in the Dems position, would you want them to remove the filibuster and pack the courts?"
2.0,"Both parties could have removed the filibuster many times. Neither did because of the concerns it raises when they are now in power.

2.0,No I'm with you. That was my cynicism speaking before. I mean I just can't think of any reason why the dems wouldn't fill the court with judges when they have complete control if not for their own worry over re-election... To yeah get the moderate and independant votes.
2.0,You missed the point of the example. If any party loses support and dies due to radicalism they still have huge representation in the court under your proposal.
2.0,"It's not, but I don't exactly see why we need to bring up Biden's role in the Thomas nomination every time we point out what a shit head Thomas is.  It's like we're desperately trying to advance the both sides narrative.  Thomas is objectively worse than Biden in almost every conceivable way, and while Biden has gone on since those hearings to do good things, Thomas has been a thorn in the side of democracy, justice and basic human decency ever since.  

I see no value in flogging Biden at every opportunity for what he did 30 years ago."
2.0,Your proposal would make congress more extreme on both sides. I don't think it's a good idea.

2.0,The tribal way of life in Afghanistan won.  We tried to force democracy and our beliefs on them for 20 years.  Kabul is the capital and largest city of Afghanistan. They couldn't convince the rest of the country to adopt a whole new world.  The country is tribal and Islam¬†is the official religion of Afghanistan. That never changed.
2.0,"You‚Äôre absolutely right. The reality in Afghanistan never changed. Both Karzai and Ghani have spent a large amount of the foreign aid to bribe tribal leaders or face their armed resistance. That‚Äôs the way Afghanistan runs, plain and simple. Obama should‚Äôve left right after Bin Laden was eliminated and disregard Bush‚Äôs rebuilding mission that wasn‚Äôt the reason why we went there in the first place. Democracy is something nations have to fully understand and embrace or it‚Äôll fail. The struggle in Rome after the assassination of Julius Caesar boiled down to pro-monarchy versus the supporters of the Republic. Democracy is an everlasting struggle that every generation must fight for."

2.0,"I agree. Democrats are constantly on their back foot. Democrats are like look at the data, look at the facts, we can save / help / enhance / invest in _______. And that‚Äôll help 90% of Americans. Republicans can drop a meme about Venezuela and socialism and rally 50% of the electorate. Republicans now days appeal to fear of the other, nostalgia, and the base tendencies of their base. Their wins are supported by the remnants of the ‚Äògood Republican‚Äô. 

Don‚Äôt expect anything to get better. Don‚Äôt expect a splinter party of traditional Republicans to emerge in a meaningful way and get the rank and file to ‚Äòcome to their senses‚Äô. 

The future is a dysfunctional, dystopian mess. Crappy roads, crumbling schools, bigger prisons, the endemic presence of Covid-19, and fewer rights for women and minorities.

2.0,I‚Äôd love for you to make this exact same post in the Republican forum.  Get back to us with a summary of their responses.  Should be entertaining.
2.0,"In my opinion we are all independents. Dem or Republican are labels for the politicians. I like some ideas from both sides or at least I used to. Republicans like to control spending which I agree with. Only I think that spending control should all go toward the defense budget which gop loves to over inflate. 

From the things you said you liked, you are def more Democrat as Republicans actively want all those to go away.they hate unions. Hate regulations. Hate employee protections. Want no min wage. Want no osha. Want people working more hours and less days off. Democrats don't like big govt they think the govt should be there to help people when they need it and protect people when they can. Gop uses that to con people into saying dems want to control our lives. Which is what they want to do while claiming they are getting govt off people backs. Whatever that means. They want high taxes for the middle and lower class and no taxes for the rich. And they are almost all rich themselves while the Democrats have alot of ppl that were part of the working class before getting elected."

2.0,This isn't overreach at all. Even the provision of using the civil courts to enforce it isn't overreach. It does the next best thing possible to calling it murder like it should be and enforcing it by state law enforcement: It puts the enforcement in the hands of the people instead of the state or federal government.

Not long ago my day shifted based on how bad the news was and every day it was bad so my days were all bad.

2.0,What is your basis for the punishment for murder? Or do you not believe murderers should be punished?
2.0,"It is encouraging to hear that my response was helpful. Thank you.
I agree that is important to listen to the opposing side. I find i often become arrogantly certain that I am absolutely correct when I either just think through it on my own or only listen to those that agree with me. But hearing the other side often adds perspective or brings up things that I didn't consider. This doesn't always change my position, but it helps me consider more aspects than I originally did which is important to having opinions about the world as a whole and how different things work together."
2.0,Murder of a human or murder of a fetus?

2.0,"They could just have way less rape cases in general? Because judging from the wording, it means per 100,000 people in the country and not 100,00 rapists.

For example I am a relatively progressive person , but I believe that in case that someone is a criminal (like killer ,rapist), bigot, doesn't believe in gender equality  etc then we shouldn't allow them to stay in a country or they should be deported. But if someone is a tolerant and nice person, I would be okay with them."

2.0,"I think it's, for every 100,000 people who were born in Denmark, 0.7 persons have committed and was convicted of a rape. So for 200k 1.4 was convicted.

For those of Somali origin over 25 have been convicted. This doesn't even include Somalis who were born in Denmark because it's by country of origin"
2.0,"You're right, probably missing some context, or maybe is the definition of rape that differs"
2.0,"I wont down vote you yet, I will give you a chance to come up with proof of your claim. Please provide a link to validate that this claim that these stats are faked.  


Also, note that not all, but a lot of times when republicans disagree with stats its because there is a reason to besides they hurt my feelings. Like there are conflicting reports. Like a month or so ago when the CDC said Florida's daily covid death rates where through the roof, but come to find out the CDC had messed up the data and took a 3 day death total and displayed it as happening in 2 days. There were news articles proving this mistake, in that instance, yes republicans disagreed with stats because they were proven wrong.  


On that note I am giving you a chance to prove this wrong.  


But, while these links don't confirm these actual stats they do confirm the sentiment that the refugees from africa and the middle east are causing crime and rape problems in europe.

2.0,"You are right, in this statistic you need to take into account weather getting that statistic uses a general definition of rape or if it uses it's own countries law or definition of rape which it's actually surprising how laws differ extremely from country to country.

However even if their using the country of origins laws you would still have to wonder why Denmark has a low rape count? Do they have extremely strict laws or are they hiding their cases from us? Does Denmark stack up in comparison to other western countries(where the laws would be somewhat similar, obviously there would be some differences between them all) and would that show us something vastly different in comparison?

Also, if you were to look at the stat through a different lens like ""ohh well Denmark is just more civil"" or something of the sort then suddenly this has a vastly different meaning to what is presented as truth.

In other words, this statistic paints a pretty incomplete picture and it would help if it had something to drive the point home that wasn't itself."
2.0,"Or they just have less rapes in general. If you only have 2 rapes per 100,000 people, it would end up that you are arresting around 35% of them which is about twice as high as the rate of the US."

To reiterate and be clear, I simply disagreed with the prevailing sentiment and pointed out that statistics can be misleading. I have not done research into this specific instance, and I don‚Äôt care to.

The exception is orders that are illegal - soldiers are expected to disobey an illegal order - however, they will have to defend doing so in a court martial (though in wartime they might not make it that far).

The issue here is that this Lt. Colonel was not personally given an illegal order, so he had no grounds to disobey one.  At present, we don't know of any other instance where anyone involved was given an illegal order.  We know lots of **stupid** orders were given, but even so, not to this LTC.

What he did was violate the UCMJ, possibly in several particulars.  He will be lucky to not see prison as a result."
2.0,"So you want every swinging d*ck in the military debating what are good and bad orders and deciding which to obey and ignore?

13 deaths is going to look like nothing when that disfunction hits."
2.0,"He has refused to speak about it. When you are misquoted and it can forever taint your reputation you have to vehemently speak out. 
He hasn't.
Silence implies consent. That us the legal standard.
Why are you defending him anyway? He screwed his assignment in Afghanistan and your fellow countrymen will die, and already have, because of his weak leadership.
He will be addressing the Foregin Relations committee, let's see how that goes."
2.0,"1st of all it would have to be a legitimately elected government before it could be called treason.
 Also I'm not talking about overthrowing anything. 
I simply pointed out legal references to why a military officer could do this, 
And to show how it is the people responsible to speak against this administration so that the military can legally remove them. Who said I'm pussy footing around. Not all of us are scared to speak out."
2.0,"Yes, it‚Äôs unfortunate how poorly American heroes are compensated."
2.0,"Yeah I don‚Äôt understand, he‚Äôs not smart enough to just wait? Like they‚Äôre all corrupt we already knew that why throw ur whole career away there‚Äôs no honor in it"
2.0,The military isn't a democracy.
2.0,"The German Army has never been under the UCMJ, and the situations are not remotely similar."
2.0,Just seems people can give orders that result in deaths and get no punishment. Someone speaks against those people who directly caused others to get killed and they go to prison.
2.0,"T. Jefferson did commit treason - They all did and they knew it - he was explaining why he committed treason to the world hoping for help - that's why Ben Franklin said

We must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.
Benjamin Franklin

That is the punishment for treason

Declare your independence and get to fighting. Otherwise

Merle"
2.0,You get to say all that because your not in the military - he doesn't cause he is - he could have resigned and said anything he wanted - he didn't so he violated military law - it ain't about your feelings - it's about maintaining discipline
2.0,"Yeah that's why I said none. 

Thought it made more sense to work here to build America than nation build in the Middle East.

Interesting timing on his annual ""Schelle acknowledged that he was the one who was forced to undergo a mental health screening after his initial video."""
2.0,He's was a Lt Col. and I'm not talking about Biden - I'm talking about military discipline - 93 upvotes
2.0,"No? Immoral or unethical behavior should always be questioned; since you mention UCMJ, I should tell you we are required to disobey unlawful orders and are supposed to question seemingly unethical actions are report them."
2.0,Yep.  That's how the military works.
2.0,He could have resigned his commission as an officer and flapped his gums all day with no worries or repercussions - he didn't and violated the law
2.0,"So you think the only reason this was added to the declaration of independence is because Jefferson was only justifying their actions? I think it was more so those that came after them would know what should be done and create a legal path todo so. I'm sure no lawyer but it seems to be more than justification but a warning to be prepared for future tyranny.

I definitely agree with the love it or leave it part tho. I think more than a few need to have their citizenship revoked and sent out of the country and some should be held accountable for their actions that have lead to our current situation."
2.0,"I am in the military and nothing restricts my speech off of duty hours or out of uniform. 

For commissioned officers it is indeed different. My point is there‚Äôs a different between morals and laws. 

He was have been limited by law in technically, but morally he had an obligation to defend the honor and the lives of the service members serving under him. 

Countlessly the president and other high appointed officials, military and not do things that are blatantly against the UCMJ and against the law. Almost never do they face repercussions, and even very little do they receive scrutiny, that is as long as it sides with the left viewpoint that almost every corporation sector  and power house in this country supports."
2.0,The reality of Military service
2.0,So you can tell the difference between President and commanding officer?
2.0,Then he should have resigned his commission and then complained - citizen presidents don't get court martials bc their not soldiers - who was the last president some country didn't want tried for war crimes - they don't get a fcking opinion - nor does a commissioned officer - period
2.0,The UCMJ and code of conduct clearly restricts speech of any enlisted or commissioned officer in the military.  You might need a crash course on military law.
2.0,"No, abandoning our people and actively arming a terrorists organization is plenty of ammunition to question what the hell is going on.  If you can‚Äôt even admit that point, I don‚Äôt see a reason in continuing this conversation."
2.0,"Yeah like the the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of a military department who are also covered and who I assume probably had something to do with the withdrawal - it's getting sad now"
2.0,Do you personally believe the current president and his administration have become a danger to America?
2.0,So your saying the declaration of independence is nothing but paper or our constitution?
2.0,"Go ahead and look up the hatch act and DOD Directive 1344.10. 

The UCMJ directly states commissioned officers."
2.0,"The declaration of independence was a document explaining why British citizens were overthrowing their government and included specific examples of abuses by the king to justify why they were doing it to gather support from other British subjects living in the colonies and other European powers.

The Constitution was created to create a new constitutional republic to replace a failing confederacy of states. It includes a blue print for how this government should operate and how it can be changed through constitutional amendments. All states ratified this through a vote making it the new law of the land.

The bill of rights were added later through the amendment process established in the constitution because it was the law of the land. 

There is no, we declared independence so you can legally do it whenever you want clause.

Again, you want a revolution prepare to get bloody. And if that's you intention, quit pussy footing around, declare you rebellion and get to fighting"
2.0,"Well the only thing evil need to spread is for good men to do nothing. 

I would rather find peaceful legal solution. However I won't choose doing nothing while evil destroys our country and the American way of life. 
My family had fought in every war this nation has ever been in from the 1st to the last. I won't be the one to change that. While it scares the hell out of me, I won't comply with what my heart tells me is wrong."
2.0,"So when does your declaration of independence get released. 

The colonists had 27 abuses and usurpations by the king to justify their treason. Let's start with the abuses and usurpations you feel the Constitutional Republic has completed against you."
2.0,"Hope he gets to sue the crap out of them, why can't the right have values and opinions. Also he's supporting a passed law so he has a right to do so."

Slightly more people wear on public transport, some put them on just when they travel. Walking in central stockholm, maybe 1 in 100 you see wear mask. Cashiers and working people are some times required to wear one. Mostly people stopped caring.

2.0,">(of 12) 9 of these patients are now home, and the 10th is rapidly improving

2.0,"Doctors have a duty to do no harm, if you wanted lots of pain killers that could stop your breathing and kill you, there‚Äôs a limit to what they will give since they can‚Äôt practice what would be literal suicide at that point. Also there are laws. In the case of a doctor won‚Äôt intubate or use resuscitative measures if you have that signed along with other treatment modalities you can chose to refuse. Plus depending on the drug many have drug-drug interactions that could either enhance or decrease the current efficacy of medications you‚Äôre on based on its metabolism. Lastly it‚Äôs for prevention of law suits. Let‚Äôs say you ask for a bunch of random medication and survive yet have side effects that cause permanent damage or require surgery or other things, now you‚Äôll be suing the hospital. 

Lastly in the case of this tweets correlation doesn‚Äôt equal causation. Ivermectin is used to treat parasites. People are buying animal formulations and overdosing themselves, and the media is having a field day calling it medicine. Just like I‚Äôve seen people struggling financially use animal antibiotics and getting deathly sick or using insulin doses for pets. Covid is a virus. Viruses aren‚Äôt alive. Just like antibiotics which work on bacteria wouldn‚Äôt help in this case, neither would anti fungal medication. 

I also don‚Äôt understand why the people who adamantly argue that this virus is a hoax or man made or not that serious and won‚Äôt get vaccinated or wear a mask suddenly feel so scared of it that they have to take ivermectin.  

Next thing you know, covid patients are gonna be asking for chemo and radiation to kill everything in their body."
2.0,"Yes, the hypocrite oath. Yes, assisted suicide is for the most part illegal in the US. I am familiar with DNRs, I used to be a paramedic and worked in a trauma center. Also I am familiar with contraindications when I comes to medication, I was a line Medic in the Army. However, if I was in sound mind and sighed a liability waver or give power of attorney to a family member, thus relasing the attending physician of any and all legal liability prior to my contraction of ANY virus or illness, why not?  The virus is not a hoax but, my job allows me to view certain government materials. The last brief I read was that COVID spread was ""very unlikely"" to be spread naturally. ""More than likely"" leak out the lab, however not meant to be a bio agent. 

I do not believe any virus is a hoax, we have pictures of them. That was not my argument."
2.0,I mean I support the whole your body your choice thing. I‚Äôm only a 4th year medical student so I can‚Äôt speak from too much experience yet. I think if the person is willing to pay and like you said of sound mind and judgement and doesn‚Äôt hold anyone liable then by all means. But they shouldn‚Äôt then go and claim whatever worked for them as a miracle cure without further testing since there are many factors that go into play. And a sample size of 1 is meaningless.
2.0,"Much respect for being a med sudent!! We need more doctors in this country. You are a 4th year med student you can absolutely speak. Do not think you can not. I don't advocate for for treatments that work worked for me will work for others. I am a big dude. So my doses are usually higher. However, if look at dose to weight ratios you can see why people do things, without the understanding of rNA insulin vs. Synthetic."
2.0,Yea exactly and thanks I appreciate it. Always nice to have a civil discussion. I‚Äôm not a rebuplican or democrat and my views vary depending on the topic but I think we lack the critical thinking and decent these days

2.0,"I saw an interview with Larry Elder. He said that if he is elected legally he can appoint an empty Senator seat. One of the Senator's has hinted of retiring. If that person leaves office, Larry Elder can appoint a Senator. If that happens, Republicans gain the majority in the Senate. So Democrats are doing everything they can to avoid that situation."
2.0,"He said that the UK paid reparations to the slave owners, not that the US should. You are lying (again)... but your vehement arguing lacks logic. And you look down to (black) people... like a ""stolz Hausmeister"" and a ""Vizehausmesterin""..."
2.0,Cenk thinks rape of animals is ok on record
2.0,You think this is bad... Candace Owens speaking on slavery in a recent Prager U video was even worse.
2.0,"So this is what I worry about‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve followed TYT for years, but recently they made a very convenient edit to videos from Jimmy Dore, regarding alleged sexual harassment towards Ana Kasparian. As I stated before, I‚Äôm not a fan of jimmy Dore at all, but his comments were about Kasparian being unprofessional with her work attire, and framing it as a joke. What he said was, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a nice ‚Äúnews‚Äù skirt‚Äù‚Äî  They played a clip of Dore saying, (this is not verbatim) ‚Äúi made her feel terrible, and ashamed‚Ä¶ I did that‚Äù ‚Äî then the clip stops and Cenk calls him a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù. Right after the clip cuts off, Dore finishes his comment by explaining how terrible it was that he made her feel that way, and then he apologized. 
‚Äî‚Äî with that said, I‚Äôm voting for Newsom, don‚Äôt like Elder, but I‚Äôm very curious about what he said after the clip stopped, because it was very abrupt. Elder doesn‚Äôt seem like he is advocating for paying slave owners reparations. The point he seems to be making is that it was legal to have slaves, so if reparations were paid out, an argument could be made for the slave owners receiving reparations as well. He didn‚Äôt sound like he was advocating for that, but just making a point on reparations as a whole. If I were to make a guess, he was making an argument against reparations, not making a point that slave owners should be paid as well."
2.0,"Did TYT Forget before the Civil War the government's wanted to buy all the slaves then free them? 
      Then again they can't even be honest and just say how dare this black man say something that's against us."
2.0,Larry knows how to win over white people as do many black far right conservatives. It‚Äôs good for business.

This was after all a section introduced and presented by her about the Taliban literally holding new media hostage in Afghanistan. You decided to steal the segment by turning it into an attack on your American media rivals. When Ana tried to respond to this you cut her off repeatedly and then said ""hold on"" which suggests you will allow her to respond at the end. But once you made your point you ended the section without allowing her any retort. 
The Taliban taking total control of the media is an important story but you dismissed it and silenced Ana voice by wagging your finger at her and then holding your hand up to silence her in a very dictatorial fashion. 
This came off terribly. I'm not saying this as some sort of fan of Ana, I actually think she too often doesn't do her due diligence before reporting on a story and it clearly shows but as a boss I would never raise my voice to literally drown out the voice of a female staff member while wagging my finger at her and then use the ""stop!"" hand gesture to silence them.

2.0,if this guy run i will vote for him
2.0,Police Chief Art Acevedo is the best leader and I am a big fan.
2.0,"Great police chief,  he 100% right."
2.0,A wise man. We all need 2 come together... We have become a divided nation!!!üò¢
2.0,"This man is one of the reasons I respect people who serve our country with honor and respect. I‚Äôm not just talking about people who wear the uniforms eitherüòí. Chief Acevedo made a good point where our problems lie. If you want things to change in your favor then you need to vote for it. Also, I know that this is old news but I really don‚Äôt understand why people always think violence is the answer. Look what this worldwide riot sparked from. Police brutality. I happen to respect the police department but when there is an officer who uses unnecessary force or worse goes against all protocol and what has been taught, then I lose that respect. Trump‚Äôs answer during this crazy situation was to ‚Äúdominate‚Äù. I was disappointed not just because of how he spoke to the governors but also that he decided to use force as a first solution. should never be a first solution, no matter the circumstances. Here‚Äôs why. First depending on who you‚Äôre picking a fight with and how many, they might beat you senseless. Second all you are doing is making yourself look like the bad guy which is okay if you‚Äôre trying to conquer someplace but not such a good a idea to do with your own nation. Finally we have a thing called diplomacy. Ever heard it? Been around since the Roman Imperial Era? It doesn‚Äôt just apply with political agendas, if you know the country then it applies just as well to the public. Talking things out isn‚Äôt a guarantee, especially in the ‚Äúfree country‚Äù, but in emergency situations it‚Äôs a better first option than sending the National Guard. Violence is always met with more violence."
2.0,What should people do when we are physically threatened by those who are not peaceful towards us?
2.0,"So proud of you Mr. Acevedo...1 because you were chief here in Austin, TX, where I reside, 2 because you are now chief in Houston, where I was born & raised, 3 because you are an Orgullo Latino, 4 because you are a big hearted human being & I can just go on & on...anyways. God bless u always, Mr. Acevedo üôèüèΩ"
2.0,No cop they stepped into the danger willingly when they got hired leadership hmm stop whining an lead then

2.0,What are white people so afraid of?
2.0,"Germany and Austria teach students the Holocaust year after year and that was relatively recent and perpetrated and witnessed by grandparents still perhaps alive. Are they less patriotic for it? No,"
2.0,"I'm sorry I have to say this but most Americans still look at black people as former slaves. It's a part of our national history that we brought slaves to America to work in the fields picking cotton. So we can't change what Americans were taught in school. History is history, like it or not. In my entire life I have never judged a man or woman by the color of their skin. I wasn't brought up that way. But we have to teach our children that it is wrong. People need all the information available to make their decisions on how the country is run. If you start banning books then the public is not getting all the available information and they are unable to make proper decisions."
2.0,"Isnt that what Hitler did ban and burned book, educated people laughable, racist yes they are and no longer care that you know it."
2.0,Thanks God for the internet. We in the rest of the world see how AMERICA IS NOT GREAT. WORLD AMERICA IS NOT GREAT!!!!

2.0,"We should just have us a good old fashioned book burning and throw our devil worshiping music in the flames while we‚Äôre there. Maybe we should throw that pesky bible in to really stoke those flames lest someone get a hold of it and mention repentance. 
  Hold on.ü§îWait a minute. ü§óIf you don‚Äôt acknowledge you‚Äôve done something wrong in the past, and you erase the evidence of the pain caused and don‚Äôt talk of it then there‚Äôs no reason to repent. Saved again and we get to keep the book."

The next generation should have a more thorough understanding than the previous generations. Otherwise the sensors are doing a disservice to the future, of an otherwise great nation..."
2.0,"This is not a battle if ideologies. The deputized book burners are what stands in the way of a progressives entering congress and the white house. Without the book burners who is going to vote for trump. trump is just the John Gotti of Billionaires (he salivates in the spotlight) but everything he truly stands for the ultra rich families back 100%. How else could book burners have so much resources. Google CRT and the first 3 page results are dominated by anti CRT articles. How could they enter candidates for every political and civic office in the country, from small districts to the presidency, sheriff, District Attorney, SCHOOL BOARDS. Parents who like there history honest just set some time aside to learn together with your kids, I recommend the story of Jim Thorpe or the 1936 Berlin with the articles or documentaries that include Jesse Owens African American team mates that won medals of their own and their experience back home."

2.0,China is asshoe
2.0,"maybe on the other side, china reports sleepy joe is the worse president in this term"
2.0,"I've been an American citizen for 26 years. During this time I've been following Russian and American news. I understand two perspectives. Americans aren't being told the truth neither about Russia nor China. In fact, with respect to both, Americans are constantly told lies, especially about China. When Trump was saying let's make friends with Russia, I began to think that Trump really wants to free America from the control of the Deep State because making any deals with Russia is what the Deep State doesn't want, be they Neocons or Democrats. Trump acted like Democrats were preventing him from making friends with or even talking to Putin or having a negotiation, meanwhile he imposed sanctions after sanctions against Russia. Then, at the end of Trump's term, he truly waged a massive anti-China information campaign, similar to the one Reagan waged against the USSR. What this tells me is that Trump wanted to fool everyone that he is a nice guy who wants to make friends with Russia and others. This tells me that he is still down with the people who are interested in regime changes in Russia and China and are not interested in negotiations, which means that Trump isn't any better than Bush, Obama, Clinton, etc. He almost fooled me. I thought that Trump was against the DS, but he was with the Neocons. If he wasn't with the Neocons, then he was surrounded by them, which means that he just couldn't really do anything from the get go and he wasn't in control of anything. They only allowed him to do certain things and said no to everything else. It is a 2-party 1-party system and the president is just a puppet, whether it is Trump, Biden, Obama, or Santa Claus."
2.0,I'd take Pompeo for President.
2.0,If Trump runs and wins in 2024 he needs to go scorched earth on every Dem and corrupt Rep in office.  We all understand you have limitations on your first term and that the second term is the time you get to pull all the punches.  Which is why the Dems were shitting their pants and which is why they used the Media to hide their illegal activities and corruption.

The tyrants want all the free thinking, freedom minded cops and military to quit.
That way when the tyrants turn the police and military against citizens; they will have only ones that will follow orders."

2.0,"Trickle-down ecomonic policy fails a shift in market (computer automation).
Automation dominates production and unstoppable.
Jobs are considered waste with automation, targets for removal.
Market doesn't create jobs like before, why taxes should be raised to pay for new jobs and infrustructure.
Trickle-down ignores that critical effect of computer automation, fuels inflation to give a boost to job loss from automation.
No compelling reason for citizens to pay for automation job-recovery with inflation when it's good times for market(automation).
Automation is good thing, saves time and gains more value than gold.

We allow politicians to invest in automation, they gain more despite job loss so it goes ignored.
Adding the 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution would fix it, end corruptton and trickle-down policy.
