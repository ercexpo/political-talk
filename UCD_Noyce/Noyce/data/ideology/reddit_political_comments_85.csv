Most of the candidates faded into the background (including whoever commissioned the poll, as evidenced by my inability to remember who they were!) -- except for Aboushi & Weinstein.

The positive statements about Weinstein were leagues more impressive than for everyone else, and, crucially, none of the negative statements really stuck. Sure, the fact that she's married to a hedge fund guy gives me pause, but her qualifications are stellar.

As for Aboushi, her personal story and dedication to progressive values really stand out. But the negative statements in the poll were brutal.

The Republican party needs to rebrand itself, RIGHT NOW.  

Based on todays world, and lessons learned from history, we need to redefine what our core Republican values are in 2021 and beyond. What do we want the government's role to be in todays world? 

I hear many dated ideologies from current Republicans in office, and in my opinion, are holding us all back. We need to first look into what we want the future to look like while taking into account advancements we will make as a society(especially technological) and how that will benefit this country on both economic and societal levels. 

One example, is Healthcare. We can slowly incorporate technological advances into making Americans healthy that in turn result in better business. A healthier working class is a more efficient working class that results in better all around business and livelihood. Now the question is, how does this get funded? Well, that's where we debate and come up with a solid plan.
