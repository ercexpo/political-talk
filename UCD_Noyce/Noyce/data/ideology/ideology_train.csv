1,"No, Norway is not part of the EU, but neither is the United States. Any many of the political and economic policies of Norway parallel those of the EU. Oil does contribute to the wealth of Norway, but Russia has much more oil, and it brings little comfort  to the poorer classes. And The US is not lacking in natural resources. Oil is a finite resource, and the Norwegians have shaped a fairer society expected to outlive their oil reserves."

2,"Fair point. The Senate went through all that trouble with their parliamentarian to determine they could run a second reconciliation bill this fiscal year to ‘modify’ the earlier reconciliation bill, and….. nothing.

1,"If used as intended, sure. As it stands, the filibuster exists with as much effort (literally) as an email and a 60 vote threshold for all legislation. There are reforms that do not require the removal of the filibuster but require it to be an effortful practice that should be more seriously considered, but the senate is currently hostage to one asshole in west virginia."

2,"This is explosive!
My thoughts at this point are: the Democrats must have known that the response from Trump would have been a lawsuit and investigation like this, given that their (democrats) fraud efforts were so blatant.  They must have realised that all of this would become public knowledge at some point - so how do they expect to counter this? What's their next move here?"
2,"So, suggesting Biden might want to investigate police violence because police should not be abusing citizens in the course of their duties is not good enough? Are Republicans not scared enough of Biden, so you have to put a little ooga-booga on it and bring up Obama?"

I’d much prefer Ron DeSantis to run. Ron is like Trump but he speaks better and has less stupid blunders. I don’t think Trump can win either, his reputation has been tarnished. 

Assuming that the 2020 election was fair, Trump lost for two reasons: 

Trump kinda abandoned the populist rhetoric that got him elected in 2016, his entire campaign strategy in 2020 was just calling Biden a socialist.

The second reason was that his blunders almost overshadowed his campaign, I really didn’t like some of his rhetoric but I still supported him.

If Trump wants to win in 2020 he really needs to bring back his 2016 campaign style and be more careful with his bad phrasing."

I haven't seen anecdotal evidence of ANY country, even those who are our allies, of taking Biden seriously. And our adversaries and enemies, particularly China, do not take him seriously at all, as evidenced by the bold lecturing China gave US diplomats in Anchorage recently. 

Biden's gaffes, flubs, confusion, extended absences and ""senior"" moments aren't just noticed by the American public and media. Other world leader's are taking notice, and most assuredly planning on taking advantage.

Sure, Trump had his bloviating, outspoken, off-the-cuff and, sometimes, clownish moments, but adversarial nations still refrained from crossing him bc they knew he was very serious, very confrontational and oftentimes aggressive. This has yet to be seen in Joe."

To reelect him is to say he couldn't get it done the first time around.

2,lol Bill never paid a dime himself Fox did lol. And those were defamation settlements basically because the accusers couldn't prove shit in court but if they went public with their bogus claims it would have had an impact on his show's ratings and pressured advertisers to withdraw their ad buys.

1,"I have had mixed feelings about Haley for several months. At one time I was a big supporter, and I would have said “Haley ‘24.” Her January 12th Politico interview changed my opinion of her. I thought she did an excellent job at the UN. When she left the UN job, it made no sense to me; and she didn’t give a satisfactory explanation for her departure. I think she doesn’t like Trump, but wants to use him to springboard her own future political ambitions."

It probably has something to do with E Jean Carroll, a woman who has been trying to get a sample of Trump's DNA for a long time in order to prove that he raped her. They've been fighting in court over his DNA for quite some time now. With Trump's lovely track record when it comes to women, I'm sure there are others."

The fact that you said the double standard has been changed is not apolitical. Indeed, it's **very** political. Again, look at who is getting raided and who gets softball interviews where they're not having to give statements under oath. There's no question it's political in nature."

2,"IMHO-- I think that the best thing that Trump can do right now is: To do every thing in his power to flip the Senate red and flip the House red by a large majority for 2022 elections.

No former president has ever tested the amendment's legal restrictions or meaning by running for the vice presidency. with the way things are going for Biden, Could Obama try and end run and challenge the amendment so that if Biden wins and then is put out to pasture Obama could then step in to run the country again.

1,Yes. Leave it to the NMAAH to lecture me about whiteness. The piece was based on the ideas of a white woman.

The fact is that many [people are using cigarettes to self-medicate]( which means that people in need will seek other forms of ""help"". In my opinion this is why we are seeing such an expansion of the obesity epidemic in poor neighborhoods as cigs get more expensive and junk foods get cheaper- while healthcare is out of reach.

1,"Depends, its all about degree. Left wing populism can be damaging in the USA as well. When Bernie lost the Iowa caucus, his supporters accused the system of being rigged just like Trump did when he lost. This may not seem like much, but when it happens enough, it causes decreases in social trust and political instability, all of which are bad for social democracy, which relies on a degree of social trust to maintain their welfare state long term."
2,"It’s a complex concept, but in the simplest terms before the Voting Rights Act of 1965 most southerners were Democrats.  After that the core values of the parties switched so the Democrats of the 1900s and 1860s who were owning slaves and enforcing Jim Crow became Republicans."

1,What did I tell everybody  about the  stimulus checks
0,"> Last time I checked, a majority of the population in the USA is white, so I don't think this should be a problem.

Well, technically whites still make a majority, but the amount and diversity of minorities, and the historic relations between all these ethnicities and races in America could be a problem for the messaging of a SocDem party in America. 

Its not like Norway, Denmark, or Sweden, who didn't get or have large populations until the last decade."

I’m not here to argue policy, but here’s a couple Trump policy critiques: Trump stated he would then didn’t pass an infrastructure plan, used tariffs as an economic policy, poor initial covid response... I mean, it’s silly to act like all critiques of trump are social war stuff"

0,"His district is very much following the presidential trends that Ohio is experiencing, as it includes the old steel towns of the Youngstown area and surrounding Mahoning and Trumbull counties. Both of these counties comfortably voted for Obama before shifting hard to the right and voting for Trump in 2020. In short, he knows the struggles that Ohio's working class faces, and he is definitely going to put that knowledge to good use in his campaign."
0,I grew up with the same shit Scott did. My dad didn’t get to legally vote until he was almost 40 in 1965. He’s 94 now. I saw it with my own eyes and still do to this day. It might not be that we’re of a person in the eyes of the law but there are plenty of people that think we should be and that is the problem you and thousands of right wingers clearly know exists but refuse to acknowledge or do anything about.

0,"In fairness, back when people could be blacklisted for liking communism and thr government conducted investigations to figure out who was a communist so it could make sure they never worked again, everybody was pretty tight-lipped about it.

Not saying that fascists don't deserve to be out of work, but they pretty much revel in being evil and only keep quiet because there is a consequence."

0,"Can you explain why pre-existing condition considerations are good for group pricing?  

Also insurance companies are motivated solely by profit, when they deny coverage or make essential drug subject to “prior authorization,” this means absolute hell to the people on the receiving end, and it’s all related to insurance profit.

1,"Hmmmm…

I wonder what claims about the left, without charges, without a jury of their peers, have been considered “just claims” the last four years.

Same goes for election fraud, and the Russia investigation into interference in the 2016 elections, and BLM as a whole (given that the majority of BLM events ended with zero injury to police and zero property damage).

Sigh."
