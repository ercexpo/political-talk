2,Of course they are most transparent administration ever- have you not noticed how many people within top positions in Biden's administration are blatant LGBTQ partisans?
2,Portland and other blue cities have brought this upon themselves. How long will this anarchy be tolerated? I guess as long as there are people like Juan Williams saying no cities have burned during these “peaceful protests”.

1,"So what if people of color are using the term ""Uncle Tim"", because I've absolutely seen black liberals calling him out. Is that suddenly not okay?"
2,The left can literally be as truly racist as they want and it’s okay by the media. But OMG let anyone right of socialism have a slip of the tongue and the left is ready to impale them.
1,"And make sure ALL Social Security checks are the same!
Btw......George
“Shrub” Bush.....pay back the 2.4 BILLION you stole from Social Security!"
2," Ael what you missed is he was talking about Trump going to court, and the dems not wanting to allow it. This whole part is of the democrats not following protocol and actually misusing their power. Are you daft?"
1,I thought it was illegal to impersonate a police officer?  I guess new York haas different laws than the rest of the country.
2,"It's not sensationalism.


It's propaganda. Just go watch Project Veritas if you want to see what's really going on with news."

1,He far more popular then Trump yea. But in the context of 100 years he's the 3rd least popular POTUS next to Trump. So its really not a huge accomplishment arguing as neither are overly popular.
2,I wish the WH would do that to those fake journalist all the time to show them how to do their job and stop bending the knee and protecting their leftist bosses.

1,"Ford has more people to fuck over, He wins."
2,"No but it's fair proof of their popularity, it's why people constantly criticize Biden's legitimacy because no one seems to give a shit what he has to say, and anytime he speaks on camera if it's on YouTube it's down voted into oblivion.

People clearly don't like him, people clearly don't support him. Which is something that can't really be said of Trump by comparison."
0,These are the lies that I keep telling my friends that “fox news” pushes that they refuse to acknowledge. They conflate bias other news have with these legitimate fake stories fox pushes.
2,"It’s not that he calls him out, we already have an entire party to do that All he needs to do is vote Kavanaugh in and stop playing the left’s game! It’s not hard. It’s almost as if he wants Trump to fail so he can step in. Moral grandstanding in 2018 is a leftist move."
0,"Because literally every single investigation, and every single court challenge, showed as much? 
   
If there was widespread voter fraud in the last election, it's incredible that apparently dozens of courts, including judges appointed by Trump, are in on the conspiracy."
2,"What an amazing pile of bullshit this ""article"" is. Was it written by the democratic national committee? This rag is gatting worse by the day"
0," Sweeney, it's called the silent majority. Trump not only energized his base but he also energized the opposite base.his mouth got him into the White House his mouth got him out"
2,"If Australia kneels down to China once, they will continue to do so in the future.  It is time for a reform and not rely heavily on China."
1,"Barring any major scandal, she's going to win this race."
1,So you believe people who don't have skin in the game should vote. How about prisoners. Should they vote too.
2,"No if she was elected it would definitely be because she is a black woman. If she was a white man having these opinions, people wouldnt care, it would just be like any other republican. Since she is a black woman, people are actually going to listen to her instead of just blindly voting democrat."
2,"I was actually just talking to a guy about how Nazis are National Socialists, he was so confused."
0,Not his fault the Republican controlled congress obstructed literally everything
2,RNC needs to take control of their RINO politicians. No donations until we can see some positive results from the supposed leadership of the party. Don’t let these anti American career politicians ruin our country.
2,Peterson Obama's doing was garbage glad someone did it
2,"Yes, he's a Democrat. Only Republicans get arrested."
2,"Council members ultimately cut the department’s budget by $150 million, slashing overtime pay and taking police staffing to its lowest level since 2008.

Yet even with those reductions, LAPD spending will remain at roughly $3 billion, about the same as last year.



Such a joke.

I support our boys in blue. Try picturing a world where you call 911 and someone shows up a week later."

2,"Charming, I'm gonna shit on your chest liberal."
0,"Once again, I suggest that the Florida Democrats should develop a competent Spanish language community outreach and a halfway decent volunteer organization. It is not that hard, and if they manage this, we can flip back the next version of FL-27 in 2022 without a problem. Hell, if the Florida Democrats really turn things around over the next two years, we can also get back the next incarnation of FL-26."
2,I am backing President Trump. All that remains is declas and military action.
1,Hunter Biden is the weirdest conservative boogie man after watching Trumps kids play around for 4 years in jobs they had absolutely no business doing and making absurd amounts of money doing them
0,"Furthermore, it’s far better for a parent to endure being called an ignorant bigot than to sit back and watch his children become ignorant bigots because of poor education. This is, after all, why conservatives oppose agendas like critical race theory in the first place."
2,"Jesus said ""sheep in wolves clothing,"" Dem's in republicans clothing, that why you need to investigate who you vote for, not just because someone told you to, or someone said he's a good guy. Their idea of good and your idea of good may be two different things."
2,"When the economy tanks over the next three years, the independents will come back over to our side to escape the Biden economy."
2," Kelso trump is ""regular folk"". He is not a lifetime corrupt lying politician. That's the problem is that you want a lying talking head puppet in office that doesn't do what they say. And that's why trump is president and will be another 4 years."
1,"C’mon Greg, your body language tells me Trump won. Grow a pair."
2,"All well and good, but blind stupid....the cheat is in and Republicans who didn't stand for election integrity in 2020 may well find themselves more of a minority in DC after midterms. A day late and a dollar short on this one."
2,The “journalists” are making us all leave the Democratic Party. They are so full of lies and hate.
1,They are citizens and should come no matter. Washington belongs to the people not the politicians.
0,"""Wealth tax bad because rich people good""

Source: Rich people"
2,"BLM is a racist mob Hellbent on the destruction of Whites, period. When is that realization going to occur. We cannot look for protection from government. They either fear or are controlled by panthers. It is they that want to disarm honest citizens."
1,"

TL;DR: Trump’s ratings ranged from 37-45 million, Obama’s ratings varied from 31-48 million. Biden hasn’t made a SOTU address yet.

Biden’s first SOTU will be early next year, just like Obama’s first was early 2010 and Trump’s first was early 2018. You typically have to be in office for at least a year to give a SOTU address."
1,My assumption is that OP is not a Democrat based on his name.
2,"Of course, but the liberal controlled media doesn’t want you to know that. It’s goes against their agenda"

2,"Remarkable, Rose to the Moment and Popular Agenda is propaganda on steroids!

I was Beyond Boredom watching Joe’s Speech.

All he had to say was SPEND $TRILLION and TAX EVERYONE!

The so-called “Crisis and Opportunity” Speech was a frontal attack on Democracy declaring the current condition worse than the Civil War!

This Dose of Hope was a Load of Bull!"
2,"Leftist are racists and the demlefty media is also for passing on leftist racism and creating their own.

Time for them to end in this country."
0,No. I don't want anyone who posed a socdem then swayed into a another ideology.
1,Pretty sure he actually just spelled it wrong when he was saying it. The real number was 17 billion.
1,I really like how disliked it is on the OFFICIAL White House channel.
2,"Democrats can't stand it when a black man or woman doesn't play the race card. If anyone is racist, it's the left wing radical democratic party."
2,"No, that’s the sad state of rushing to judge a Presidential who should never have been impeached a second time. The reasons were disproven! Rhinos are a disgrace!"
1,"I mean he’s come out and said he fully plans on running, so unless he dies or gets very sick in office I think you can bet on him being the candidate. And I agree that a truly progressive candidate doesn’t stand a chance in the next election, but I don’t see why we can’t discuss it for the fun of it."
2,"Perhaps, we can give these migrant kids Bernie Sanders’ book that explains what a horrible country the US is."
1,Can you imagine making it all the way to the United States Senate and not knowing what implicit means? 🤦🏼‍♂️
1,"Why are we looking at their dressing instead of listening to what they have to say? Just look at the results, people. Charlie and Candance are literally changing the way way young people look at politics and starting to make them think.  Thats more important  than the way they look at each other or what they wear.  These young leaders are fearless and awesome and both talk with facts to back their speeches.Young people will listen to them than an old guy talking in front of them on campuses."
2,Really hope Rep. Crenshaw runs for president one day
1,Because Pravda and the ignorant NYS voters are in full view.

2,"One of the most important things Donald Trump contributed to the world's political landscape is how to fight back, sometimes with amity sometimes with enmity."
1,"the people that watch CNN will soon forget, nothing will change."
1," *That should be 1988, not 1998.  It was Dukakis vs Bush.  Dole placed second in the primaries against Pat Robertson's third and the Republican nominee, Bush Sr, did in fact become President.  You're thinking of the 1996 election."
2,Go Florida. I wish we had a Gov. In ohio like Desantis.
1,"Wrong. It's a careful propaganda promoted by the family. 

The people of UK lose more money because their best castles are occupied by these people. Once you abolish monarchy, so many castles could be completely opened for tourism which shall increase revenue. 

People go to UK to see castles and museums. I don't think they go to see queen elizabeth or her family (you can't even if you wish to)"
1,So a push for federal takeover of policing. No.
0,"Ah, but have you considered Bob Rae? The radical leftist communist who...

*...checks notes...*

why would investing in reducing the toxins in our water supply be ""shocking""?

why is investing in our future ""bad""?

are Americans worth it (to 'Muricans)?

will we (or they) ever be among those our labors, resources or sacrifices ""must"" benefit most?"
2," 48thRonin 
Your right english is not my first language but i know and learned about constitution and my first amendment rights. And you trying to tell me to shut up. First of all where in the Bible that said your not love by god bcuz your not American Christian, and you are not allowed to voice your opinions...Only the mind of the delusional leftist would think this way cuz their good of naming people. Go away Satan."
0,Most of the migrants are coming from Catholic countries & they don't believe in abortion. This republican narrative is completely false.
1,Is CCP devious enough to pay thugs to beat on Asians for sympathy.
2,The Heritage Foundation could start correcting course by being more honest about it forming the bones of Obamacare decades ago. I read the original document one of Heritage's guys wrote; there was virtually no difference between it and what became Obamacare. And one of Heritage's big cheeses congratulated Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney when he shepherded a similar bill through the state legislature.
0,"I thought Reddit was joking about the continued delusion in but apparently the election fraud is still a topic for you folks. Not sure if I am sad for you or just disappointed, but I my sympathy has waned for your ignorance!"
1,"I like that there is the little fact check box about the election on this when it's just talking about the candidates,and not the election itsself"

1,"Oh I'm fully aware that JFK is no saint himself, and that if he had survived the assassination, history would be less kind to him. But if he is ""the floor"", then the current crop of GQP would be the mud beneath.

I was just referring to that [famous takedown line]("
2," Let's also bear in mind that the Constitution does not require an attack on a military base before responding to the invasion. All it requires is the act of invasion, which is legally defined as illegal entry.

That's why Eisnhower upheld the Constitution by sending Feds to round up and repel invaders.  Your insistence that we can only respond if the invaders attack a military base is idiocy.

The hostile invaders are killing Americans. 'nuff said."
0,You pretty much described the entire Great region. MI gets considered a blue state too yet i encounter anti-maskers and militia types on the regular.
0,"The only way to bring costs down is to nationalize insurance, in other words to eliminate the for profit brokers (insurance companies) who add nothing at all to health care but 35% of its cost. 
Single payer isn't a dream, its the only possible solution, like social security. Being the only industrialized country without national health care has been a disaster."
2,"He is a Democrat, he already has gotten a free ride.. Just like that Virginia Governor.. The media turns a blind eye to them.."
2,">  without proof is dangerous without trivializing rape. 

tell that to the democrats \believeallwomen \clintonrapevictims"
2,YouTube poll shows Trump 16 pts ahead of Biden.  It's probably more than that though because under 18 that can't vote yet probably said Biden because he's going to give them a bunch of free stuff.
2,This is so disheartening and frustrating as a Republican who refused to buy in to Trump propaganda.
2,"How did she cause Dems to lose 2 State Senate seats and 13 state house seats? Seems kinda hard to blame that on one Senate candidate, especially when it seems that Republicans were doing acceptably good throughout the US (flipped a bunch of House seats and whatnot). I mean, it seems her campaign wasn't great, but I didn't hear much about it being super toxic or anything."
1,WOW! What a speech! If only Trump could give that speech.
0,Talk about low info voters; working class voters voting republicans so the .1% can have their tax cut and pay even less than before
2,"I’m not sure, I guess the point where I lean more Capitalistic than Socialist."
2,"Please God, help us. 
Our president is need win.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷"
0,"I remember when they had to stop killing children... no death penalty for those under 18...the conservatives..
.hell, the Republicans cried and Said how can we discipline them if we can't kill them..."
2,"Biden is trash, a racist, a paedophile and he's got dementia to boot he's medically unfit to be president. They went with him so when he does  die or become incapacitated kamala gets the freaking job and then we're all going to kick the bucket. We're all screwed if that happens."
1,"No no it would just be a nationalist movement. Like, I don’t know.....some kind of nationalist socialism."
1,"Your headlines don't accurately reflect the question.  Which I might add, is poorly phrased.  Those students were answering this question: ""Who has more ability to project global power, America, or ISIS?"" Not ""Who is more of a threat to world peace?"" Consider asking Harvard students questions that are more thought provoking."
2,"The donations to Cruz are pretty small compared to many othes.  Of course he would support Lockeed, those are manufacturing jobs for Texas.  Mission control for  NASA is in Houston for a reason: LBJ."
0,"holy shit you’re making a compelling argument for me to shed the title conservative all together lmaoo. literally everything you just said was either objectively incorrect or indicative of a strange cult like mentality. take the tin foil hat off brother, your hair will look less greasey for it i promise"
2,Did not this nonsense all start with Bill Clinton indicating that it all depends what the definition of 'is' is?
1,Can’t wait until we get some real leadership back in the White House
0,"The bigger problem is that the Left, meaning those in power or in office right now, are mostly centrists. It seems that no matter how Left a candidate is when they first get elected, they tend to drift to the right while they are in office. They have to be pushed left from their constituency. Look at Biden. He build a career as a centrist, but as President, he had to heed his constituency in order to remain in power."
0,"> why is an ancap voting for trump

They're **really really** dumb."
0,"They way things are going, anyone who still identifies as an independent is most likely a Democrat. The division between common sense and ethical decision making is a vast chasm that won’t be “compromised” and fixed between the right and the left.  It is now a one side vs the other. There is no negotiation or compromise to be accomplished. Marxism must be defeated."
1,Wow that is something else. How someone can be that incompetent and still be considered a leader is mind boggling.
1,"“..exceeded expectations..”
but lost ground anyway. That’s the cranky, psychology of the markets."
2,And of course the spineless liberals are the ones attacking Barkley in the media
0,"You claim social democracy works better than socialism, but the nordic countries bombed a random terrorist outpost in the middle east that time back in 2012.
