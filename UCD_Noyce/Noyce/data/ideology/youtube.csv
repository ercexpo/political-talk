This movie is actually the result of an unprecedented circumstance called the coronavirus pandemic, which forced many things to shut down‚Äîincluding the bulk of the Hollywood production industry. One of those productions was HBO‚Äôs Euphoria. Like most creatives, such limits can either further bury any creative spark...or fully ignite it. The latter was true for Zendaya and show creator Sam Levinson, who decided to make a COVID-compliant production inspired by a conversation between the two. Thus, Malcolm & Marie was born.

Decoupling From CCP: US and Allies Would Cut China's Growth

As U.S.-China relations become increasingly tense, the chances of a U.S.-China decoupling has drawn increasing attention. Some economists believe that if the United States joins hands with its allies in decoupling from the CCP, it will cause a huge blow to China‚Äôs economy, dropping its GDP growth to 1.6%. If so, all kinds of social problems that were once placated by the economic growth of China will become more pressing.

Bloomberg economists Tom Orlik and Bjorn Van Roye wrote on September 3 that such a decoupling would have a much larger impact on China than on the U.S. as China gains more from cross-border exchanges of ideas and innovation.

U.S., Australia, Japan, and India Formalize Arc of Democracy in Indo-Pacific

Australia, America, Japan, and India could formalize their quadrilateral strategic security ties at an in-person ministerial meeting in Delhi in the coming weeks.

On Aug. 31, in an online seminar at the annual U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, the Deputy Secretary of the U.S. State Department Stephen Biegun said the Indo-Pacific was lacking strong multilateral structures.

He said: ‚ÄúIt is a reality that the Indo-Pacific region is actually lacking in strong multilateral structures. They don‚Äôt have anything of the fortitude of NATO or the European Union.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe strongest institutions in Asia oftentimes are not inclusive enough, and so ‚Ä¶ there is certainly an invitation there at some point to formalize a structure like this.‚Äù


CCP‚Äôs Facial Recognition Technology Collects and Sells Personal Information

Insiders of the industry indicated that the serious problem of the leak of facial recognition data in China lies in the fact that not only are the facial photos leaked, citizens‚Äô sensitive information such as ID card numbers, bank card numbers, and cellphone numbers are also leaked. And the matching photo can be used to simulate a real person‚Äôs behavior like nodding, shaking, blinking, and talking. Individuals whose personal information was stolen are at risk for the rest of their lives because their names would be registered in most software for online money lending and fraudulent activities. 


Ethnic Mongolians Petition Against Beijing‚Äôs Language Suppression

Tens of thousands of ethnic Mongolians have signed a petition in protest against Beijing‚Äôs new push to promote the country‚Äôs official language Mandarin in Inner Mongolia, a move that some have described as ‚Äúcultural genocide.‚Äù

Last week, widespread anger began brewing in the northern Chinese region of Inner Mongolia after authorities announced they would introduce Mandarin-only teaching to local schools and replace Mongolian-language textbooks with standardized Chinese versions for core courses that range from history, politics, to literature.

The new policy has sparked fear among ethnic Mongols in the region that it would gradually wipe out their culture and endanger their very identity.

Over the past week, throngs of students, teachers, and parents have gathered at local school grounds, singing and chanting slogans in their native tongue while refusing to go back to the classroom, videos circulating on the internet show.

Many Republicans have called this plan an obvious ‚Äúpower grab,‚Äù since Joe Biden was recorded in 1983 calling President Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äôs proposal to expand the court a ‚Äúbone-headed idea.‚Äù The late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was also quoted in a 2019 NPR interview saying that ‚Äúnine seems to be a good number and its been that way for a long time.‚Äù

Campus Reform Reporter Ophelie Jacobson went to the University of Florida to see if college students would support the proposed legislation. Students overwhelmingly supported expanding the number of justices to thirteen.

Jacobson then showed them the old footage of both Biden and Ginsburg criticizing Democrat attempts to pack the court.

Watch the full video above to find out whether students were willing to change their minds after seeing the video.

The coronavirus calamity hit Wuhan when residents were joyfully making preparations for the Chinese New Year. And just a few days, Wuhan turned from a vibrant city into a ghost town. Crematorium staff wearing protective suits were seen in many neighborhoods, taking away corpses who had died from the virus. Around late January, footage and images were circulating online, showing people collapsing in the street and hospitals across Wuhan.

Video#3 
Man 1: Does he have any family here with him? 
Man 2: No. 

Video#4 
A patient suddenly collapsed to the ground when lining up in a hospital. The money he brought with him for treatment is scattered all over. 

Video#5 
Man in the background: Someone suddenly fell. It looks like they're trying to rescue him using CPR. 

Video#6 
Elderly Man: Show this footage to your family, and they will understand why they must wear a mask. 

Video#7 
Man: Another body, here's another body. Look, look how many bodies are already loaded inside the minivan. Look, one, two, three, four, four of them. Here's another one. That's five in total. There are a total of five bodies in the back of this minivan. 

Video#8 
Right before the CCP claimed that there were no new infections inside China, a man collapsed right in front of the Tanzikou Water Corporation in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province. According to his ID card, he came from Qianjiang City, Hubei Province. It's unclear where he had been and how many people he had interacted with.

Nicki Minaj has made some... questionable choices as of late‚Äîlike, you know, repeatedly collaborating with verified creep Tekashi 6ix9ine. But for all the Minaj fans and the secret Barbz who admire their fave with a wince these days, worry not. I‚Äôm about to take you back in time, before the ‚ÄúRoman Holiday‚Äù memes, to the year 2010, when Nicki Minaj dressed like she just rolled out of a Lisa Frank folder.

While she‚Äôs currently one of the most celebrated artists in the game‚Äîthe undeniable queen of hip-hop and one of the few women to seamlessly crossover between hip-hop and pop‚Äîwhen Nicki was rising to stardom, she was better known by some for rocking wild costumes. She couldn‚Äôt even wear a cotton candy wig without being compared to another outlandish up-and-comer: Lady Gaga.

Cyprus, a small Mediterranean country that is a member of the European Nation, has become a ""new world"" for wealthy Chinese immigrants in recent years. A newly exposed investigation found about 500 Chinese billionaires and officials successfully obtained the ""golden passport"" from the country. Experts believe that many people have realized that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is collapsing soon, so they are trying to save themselves before this happens.

In recent years, Chinese media also admitted that many millionaires and billionaires in China all choose to transfer their accumulated wealth to foreign countries and change their nationalities.

Sheng Xue, a Chinese-Canadian author said that she knows some Chinese people that hold passports of small Central American countries. It is safer for them to hide their assets and identities there. ‚ÄúThey are afraid to be sanctioned, to have their sources of wealth investigated, and to be held accountable for their inhumane crimes committed in countries like the Five Eyes Alliance. Therefore, they are willing to choose those small unknown countries,‚Äù she explained. They knew that the Party must collapse sooner or later so they had to flee before the crisis happened.

Previously, Xin Ziling, an expert on China‚Äôs institutional system, had revealed in an interview with The Epoch Times that before the 18th National People‚Äôs Congress, the CCP had conducted an internal investigation in which it found more than 85 percent of the CCP officials were prepared to flee the Party and family members of these officials had already settled in foreign countries. Xin Ziling said that Xi Jinping admitted in a conference in June 2016 that the CCP has reached the brink of collapsing. Hu Jintao and Wang Qishan have also issued several warnings over the crisis.

154,"An area home to some of the earliest civilizations, Iraq became a battleground for competing forces after the US-led ousting of President Saddam Hussein in 2003. The country remains volatile and the lives of innocent people have been victim to brutality.

Since then, approximately one million Assyrian Christians have been forced to become refugees inside and outside of Iraq.In the summer of 2014 ISIS terrorists broke through the borders of Iraq and have forced the Iraqi and Kurdish military to seek help from world powers in defending their country.

Persecution through Religious and Ethnic Cleansing
 
Assyrian Christians in Iraq have been forced to greatly compromise their freedom. Since 2003, orders to either convert to Islam, pay a protection tax, exit Iraq without their personal belongings, or be killed have been in place.
There is ample proof that exists to ensure this threat is real. Countless Christians have been crucified and thousands of parents have buried their children following brutal and vicious murders. Families have been ripped apart and suffered immeasurable atrocities at the hands of ISIS.

Assyrian Christians have specifically been targets of this cruelty. Since 2008, many priests and church deacons have been kidnapped, beheaded, and assassinated with their body parts scattered among their churches. Ancient Christian churches and monasteries have been continuously bombed and many churches have been converted into mosques.

On September 15, the United States issued a sweeping new advisory warning against travel to mainland China and Hong Kong, citing the risk of ‚Äúarbitrary detention‚Äù and ‚Äúarbitrary enforcement of local laws.‚Äù

The advisory is likely to heighten tensions between the sides that have spiked since Beijing‚Äôs imposition on Hong Kong of a strict new national security law in June that has already been met with a series of U.S. punitive actions.

The statement warned U.S. citizens that China imposes ‚Äúarbitrary detention and exit bans‚Äù to compel cooperation with investigations, pressure family members to return to China from abroad, influence civil disputes and ‚Äúgain bargaining leverage over foreign governments.‚Äù

The advisory said: ‚ÄúU.S. citizens traveling or residing in China or Hong Kong, may be detained without access to U.S. consular services or information about their alleged crime. U.S. citizens may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention without due process of law.‚Äù

Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has revealed that Zhenhua Data, a Chinese firm based in Shenzhen, is monitoring 2.4 million people around the world. The firm's main clients include the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its military. Chris Balding, an American scholar, said that ""China is absolutely building out a massive surveillance state both domestically and internationally."" This poses a threat not only to Chinese citizens, but also to citizens of the world. 

When Chris Balding started researching the internal workings of Huawei, the Chinese technology giant, last year, he obtained a copy of Zhenhua Data‚Äôs vast database. The company monitors high-powered influencers around the world, including national leaders, military officials, entrepreneurs and artists, as well as their friends, family, and colleagues. The information collected by Zhenhua Data includes birth dates, addresses, marital status, photos, relatives, and social media accounts. 

A Chinese researcher named Zhang Jian said, ""This data is meant to be used against these Western countries one day to launch a propaganda war that favors the CCP‚Äôs rule. The company is involved in this paramilitary battle with the intelligence community.""

Anhui Province, located between the Yangtze River and the Huai River, was overly flooded because the government decided to protect Henan Province and Jiangsu Province. However, the disasters in Anhui Province and the calls for assistance are not able to be researched on Weibo and are also ignored by the Chinese state-run media. 

On July 22 and 23, Anhui netizens were outraged on Weibo, questioning why the floods were not taken seriously and got no attention.

186,"Ahead of the 19th anniversary of the September 11th attacks, Campus Reform Digital Reporter Eduardo Neret spoke to students to see what they knew about the tragic events of that day. 

FULL STORY: Ahead of the 19th anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks, Campus Reform spoke to students to see what they knew about the tragic event in the nation‚Äôs history.

While most students had very broad and general knowledge about the day‚Äôs events, many did not know basic details about which U.S. cities were attacked and who was responsible for the attacks.

‚ÄúThe loss of the lives of the tower‚Äù one student responded when asked what the country commemorates on 9/11.

‚ÄúThe two Twin Towers that were standing there in, I believe it is...no I can‚Äôt tell you where it‚Äôs at,‚Äù another student said.

Campus Reform then asked students if they remembered who carried out the attacks.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt [remember],‚Äù one student said. ‚ÄúI think it was just two immigrants that flew planes.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know it was the Middle East,‚Äù another added. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure who exactly.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike the Taliban, or like Afghanistan, or like Iraq‚Äù one student wondered aloud before settling on Osama bin Laden.

244,"Netflix‚Äôs Floor Is Lava is simply the latest in a long line of TV shows that I can‚Äôt believe were greenlit and yet I somehow cannot look away.

Based on a children‚Äôs game where players walk on furniture and act like the floor is, you guessed it, lava, the show features three teams of competitors jumping on floating objects and scaling walls to avoid falling into the ‚Äúlava.‚Äù

The show‚Äôs lava is apparently a proprietary recipe that was chosen after testing at least 50 different mixes, but to me, it looks like a big pool of warm red Kool-Aid. Ohhhhh, yeah!

The most fascinating thing about the show is that it‚Äôs unclear what happens to the contestants once they fall in. People unlucky enough to wipeout during the game are swallowed up by the lava pit, never to be seen or heard from again (except for if their team wins overall, where they magically reappear in a room where the host announces they‚Äôve won $10,000 split three ways and a lava lamp).

During the interview, Fox News host Ed Henry noted that ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt every day you see people carrying long guns on the streets of America‚Äù as images of Black protesters carrying rifles‚Äîterror porn for Fox News viewers‚Äîpopped up next to him. ‚ÄúWhat is happening on the streets of America this morning?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, Ed, this is totally unacceptable, we cannot allow mob rule,‚Äù Loeffler replied, as more scary images of Black people holding guns appeared next to her. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a nation of the rule of law, and this is exactly what will happen if we defund the police, and this is exactly what the Democrats want to do. They have a move to defund, to dismantle law enforcement.‚Äù

286,"Campus Reform Digital Reporter Eduardo Neret asked students and young Americans if they would vote for a politician who thinks they are ""stupid."" Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris previously referred to Americans between the ages of 18-24 as ""stupid."" Students initially thought the remarks were made by President Trump, but were ""not surprised"" to hear they had been made by Harris.


ARTICLE: 

After the Joe Biden campaign announced U.S. Senator Kamala Harris as the ticket's vice-presidential nominee, Harris' past comments referring to 18-24 year olds as ‚Äústupid‚Äù resurfaced on social media.

Campus Reform Digital Reporter Eduardo Neret asked students and young Americans if they would vote for someone who made those remarks.

Most individuals said no and disagreed with the characterization of younger Americans. Many also thought the comments were made by President Donald Trump.

‚ÄúNo, honestly,‚Äù one individual said. ‚ÄúBecause no matter what age, you‚Äôre allowed to have your own opinion. Even 18 year olds.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs who you‚Äôre representing,‚Äù one person noted. ‚ÄúThose are the types of people that, like, that are going to be voting for you so why would you talk down upon them?‚Äù

Campus Reform then pointed out that it was Harris, and not Trump, who made the comments. Students said they were ‚Äúnot surprised,‚Äù and slammed Harris for her track record on law enforcement.

‚ÄúNot surprised at all. She doesn‚Äôt have a history of being very Democratic,‚Äù one person said before slamming Harris for supporting the police. ‚ÄúFor starters, she is a big, like, fan of the police force, which is what most, like, Democrats are trying to defund and she‚Äôs like a big advocate for cops and everything so.‚Äù

‚ÄúA little bit surprised, not entirely though, because I have seen a lot of not so good things about her in regards to, like, imprisonment of people and stuff like that,‚Äù another individual added.

Others said that even though Harris‚Äô comments would factor into whether they would support Biden, they would likely still support Biden over Trump.

‚ÄúI mean it does,‚Äù one person answered when asked if Harris‚Äô comments affect how he views the Democratic ticket. ‚ÄúBut like I said, there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm voting for Trump.‚Äù

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

As experts predict the sea level to rise significantly in the coming years, the city of Miami Beach must decide how to keep itself afloat. This documentary examines how the city has taken unprecedented steps to save itself from the sea.

But back in the summer of 2008 when the average U.S. gasoline price hit a record high of $4.11, Fox said that ""no President has the power to increase or to lower gas prices"" and the only way to reduce our vulnerability to gas price spikes is to use less oil.

409,"Since the release of our North Carolina Voter Fraud investigation on Tuesday the reaction has again been swift.

According to a report on the Daily Caller and ABC News, the administrators we interviewed at the University of North Carolina are being disciplined. 

Chancellor Holden Thorp stated to ABC News, ""While the scenarios described in the video were false, some of our administrators responded inappropriately, and we are taking disciplinary action against those who used poor judgment in their approach to these student imposters."" 

The investigation also sparked discussion of a consensus bill on Voter ID in the North Carolina legislature.  Note that Governor Beverly Perdue vetoed legislation that previously passed.

Additionally, other organizations have reviewed our check of jury forms against the voter rolls and have found one individual, Mr. Romero, apparently became a naturalized citizen after refusing jury duty on the grounds of being a non-citizen.

Another individual appears to have perjured himself on the jury refusal form despite also being a naturalized citizen.

Project Veritas' journalists were offered ballots and encouraged to vote despite raising red flags with outlandish behavior -- such as speaking Spanish while asking to retrieve a foreign passport and wearing a ridiculous costume.  However, while our facts were correct in the report, the perception presented in the investigation -- which highlighted the ease in which voter fraud can be committed -- deserves correction in regards to the citizenship status of Mr. Romero and Mr. Gorzkowski. 

More footage coming soon . . .

North Carolina Ballots are offered out in the names of others to total strangers. 
We find people who, according to Jury refusal forms, are listed as non-citizens. These individuals are also registered to vote. In one case the citizen appears to have perjured himself on the Jury-refusal form, since his jury refusal came after his voter registration. All public data is available here: http://www.projectveritas.com/ncsupporting

Ballots are also handed out in the names of others to total strangers. 
A dead voter is listed on the voter rolls. We interview an election Judge who says he only wants to uphold parts of the state constitution. We also interview the following officials at UNC who seemingly embrace voter fraud:
Terri Phoenix -- Director - UNC LGBTQ Center

Did Jesus (Yeshua) really rise from the dead? Or was his body stolen from the sealed tomb guarded by Roman soldiers as the Jewish Sanhedrin charged?

The gospel record is clear on the risen Christ. But what about the charges of the Sanhedrin? Did they even believe their own cover story for the empty tomb?

Messianic rabbi Jonathan Cahn looks at the evidence and finds historical confirmation for the Resurrection of Yeshua in an unlikely source ‚Äì the rabbinical writings of the Sanhedrin itself.

Jonathan Cahn is the author of ""The Harbinger,"" the #1 bestselling Christian book in America in 2012 ‚Äì a book that stayed on the New York Times bestseller list longer than any other title. He's also the inspiration for ""The Isaiah 9:10 Judgment,"" the #1 faith movie of 2012.

Despite receiving international recognition for their performance on epidemic control, Taiwan was still not invited to this year's World Health Assembly (WHA). On this issue, Taiwanese Minister of Health Chen Shih-chung expressed that the WHO needs Taiwan. President Tsai Ing-wen also visited the Central Epidemic Command Center prior to her inauguration and invited the epidemic control team to attend the ceremony. 

On the eve of May 20th, President Tsai Ing-wen personally visited the Central Epidemic Command Center to invite the national epidemic prevention team to the inauguration ceremony. She also brought in 10 types of ‚ÄúTainan Good Noodles,‚Äù a gift from Huang Wei-cher, the mayor of Tainan.h

Tsai said: ‚Äú(I brought in) ten kinds of ‚ÄòTainan Good Noodles‚Äô to show my gratitude to you all. May our epidemic prevention efforts be exhaustive in all aspects. Everyone here is a hero in the hearts of our people. I think, in fact, this noodle should later on be called ‚Äòthe Heroes‚Äô Noodles.‚Äô‚Äù

In a video called ‚ÄúThe Taiwan Model‚Äù it says: ‚ÄúPeople who are honest are braver than those who deceive themselves.‚Äù Tsai posted the video on Facebook on May 19, documenting the ""Taiwan Model"" in every part of society: ‚ÄúMany unsung heroes hold fast to their posts, the government and the people stood united to together protect Taiwan.‚Äù Though only 5 minutes long, the video has touched many netizens. The ""Taiwan Model"" also received great international recognition, however, Taiwan was still not invited to the World Health Assembly this year. 

Tsai said, ‚ÄúThe Secretariat of the WHO, under pressure, once again turned us down in inviting us to attend the WHA. I want to use this opportunity to seriously express my dissent. Taiwan will not give up its participation in international affairs just because it has been suppressed, and we will continue to work hard.‚Äù 
 
Minister of Health Chen also added, ‚ÄúThe WHO needs us. Many countries in the world, many leaders and representatives have said, it is not about pleading for Taiwan to join the WHO, but that the WHO also needs Taiwan. (Many) people have seen the Taiwan Model‚Äôs success,‚Äù in reference to U.S. Secretary of Health Alex Azar‚Äôs speech at the WHA in support of Taiwan‚Äôs participation. Chen said that the health of 23 million people should never be sacrificed for politics, and that despite the fact that Taiwan has not been able to enter the WHA for more than three years, the world has seen Taiwan‚Äôs efforts.

On July 12, the Water Resource Bureau in Hukou county issued an emergency collection announcement. It said that due to the current critical flood situation in the county, emergency materials are in shortage and the local government is in need of woven bags.

This announcement sparked outrage among netizens. Many believe that local governments have developed a habit of asking anything they need from their citizens, and this trend started with the local authorities in Wuhan city, the epicenter of the first CCP virus outbreak in December last year. Netizens said that local authorities call on the people to respond to the floods and to do all sorts of other work. And on top of that, the people still pay taxes but receive no support from the government when they really need it most.

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

452,"When news spread that a field hospital was opening in Central Park, New Yorkers breathed a collective sigh of relief. The 68-bed respiratory-care unit would accept overflow patients from Mount Sinai, which was running out of hospital beds. It was a necessary contribution to a public-health crisis.

But the next wave of news wasn‚Äôt so optimistic. As it turns out, Samaritan‚Äôs Purse, the Christian relief organization behind the field hospital, is run by a fundamentalist preacher known for his anti-LGBTQ and Islamophobic rhetoric. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio expressed serious concern.

In a new documentary, The Atlantic visits Central Park to speak with volunteers from Samaritan‚Äôs Purse and to find out what New Yorkers think of it all. The tent hospital accepted its first patient on Wednesday.

459,"During Sunday night‚Äôs CNN Democratic presidential debate, Senator Bernie Sanders took former Vice President Joe Biden to task on his abortion record. Namely, Biden‚Äôs previous support of the Hyde Amendment, a ban on federal funding for abortion services except in the case of rape, incest, or when the life of the pregnant person is in jeopardy. The amendment is an attack on the nation‚Äôs poor and disproportionately impacts low-income people of color, and until recently, Biden supported it. In fact, Biden‚Äôs position on the Hyde Amendment did a complete 180 when his campaign was in full swing. The New York Times reports that in June 2019, after ‚Äútwo days of intense criticism‚Äù from his rivals in the Democratic primary as well as groups like Planned Parenthood and Emily‚Äôs List, Biden reversed his position.

Convenient!

‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre going to have public funding for all healthcare along the line, there‚Äôs no way you could allow for there to be a requirement that you have Hyde Amendment, a woman who doesn‚Äôt have the money, could not have coverage under healthcare,‚Äù Biden said during the debate.

Biden added that he would codify Roe v. Wade, and emphasized that he supports a ‚Äúwoman‚Äôs right to choose.‚Äù Great. It‚Äôs unfortunate that it took a couple of days of awful press one year ago for him to agree that that right was extended to women who couldn‚Äôt otherwise afford it.

Initially, students said they were not concerned about foreign involvement on American college campuses...until hearing that the Biden Center at the University of Pennsylvania received $22 million from ""anonymous"" sources in China. That's not to mention the dozens of Confucius Institutes operating on campuses across the country, which U.S. intelligence agencies have said are ""propaganda"" centers for the Chinese Communist Party.

494,"http://amzn.to/10SdbHd Order BREAKTHROUGH today. While investigating Obamacare Navigators, Battleground Texas, and their connection to Obama's Organizing for America, we caught some deeply offensive comments on tape.

Wendy Davis and Battleground Texas supporters are seen on camera making statements such as ""Since he's in a wheelchair and most the slogans are ""Stand with Wendy"" and ""Stand with Texas Women"", isn't that amazing to think of? He's in a wheelchair and we want to stand with Wendy?""

In another instance they say, ""Greg Abbott (The Attorney General of Texas) is not, he's really not a sure thing, and he's really not real electable. First of all he's not good looking, he doesn't speak very well, he doesn't have a good personality, and he's in a wheelchair.""

But that's not it. When asked about forging signatures on absentee ballots, Deputy Voter Registrar and attorney Lisa Wortham  covered her ears and then went on to admit, ""I've seen people do that all the time."" Battleground Texas volunteer Celeste Grahm then added, ""I don't think it's legal but I didn't hear you say that."" 

Project Veritas is non-partisan and does not advocate for political candidates or parties. The purpose of Project Veritas' investigations is to expose waste, fraud, dishonesty and self-dealing.

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas
504,"On Rottnest Island, off the coast of Western Australia, a peculiar marsupial has captivated the hearts of Instagram users worldwide‚Äîand supported a booming tourism economy.

One student said that while the person in the fake Tinder profile shown was ""cute,"" but said she'd swipe left because ""Trump supporter"" is in his profile.

Mystical death curses, visions of Messiah, an important world political figure under threat, religious leaders in shock, a cryptic kabbalistic death note ...

The story is shocking ‚Äì the story is true ‚Äì the story is still unfolding ...

In the fall of 2005, a 108-year-old rabbi, the most venerated rabbinical Jewish leader in Israel, proclaimed that he knew the name of the real Messiah. He insisted that he knew where the Messiah was and when He was going to reveal Himself to the world. Rabbi Kaduri claimed that he had personally seen the Messiah in a vision.

But ... there were just a couple catches: Kaduri declared that a particular and famed world leader had to die before the Messiah appeared publicly.

Also, the name of the Messiah was to be mysteriously sealed in a message. Instructions were given to lock the message away and not to open it until one year after the rabbi's death. A few months later the famous world leader fell gravely ill. The religious and political world held its collective breath.

Within weeks of the world leader's malady, the elderly Rabbi Kaduri died. Several hundred thousand people flooded the streets of Jerusalem for his funeral, one of the largest in Israel's history. The death message was secreted away for one year as the beloved rabbi had instructed.

The message was opened and deciphered. There, before the eyes of the world, was the name of the soon-coming Messiah according to this celebrated 'teacher of Israel.'

The story is true. The note that shook the religious world to its foundations is still shaking the world today. The story is still unfolding. The pieces are yet falling into place ‚Äì just as the old rabbi predicted!

557,"‚ÄúI always thought, you know, we‚Äôre pretty safe,‚Äù recalled Grace John, a senior at Santa Fe High School in Santa Fe, Texas.
 
On May 18, 2018, Grace‚Äôs sense of safety was shattered when a gunman opened fire and murdered ten people in her school. Over a dozen others were wounded.
 
The Santa Fe high school shooting was the second-deadliest school shooting in the U.S. It occurred just over three months after Parkland, where a 19-year-old man allegedly gunned down students and staff, murdering 17 students and teachers.
 
The Parkland students have been credited for changing the gun debate. Students such as David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez took on the National Rifle Association, launched the #NeverAgain movement, and organized rallies and walkouts across the country.
 
Survivors of the Santa Fe high school shooting are also calling for change. But because many of them still support the Second Amendment, the media wasn‚Äôt interested in their story, and what they think needs to be done.
 
So The Daily Signal traveled to Santa Fe to talk with students like Grace and hear what the media is ignoring.

By Roger Aronoff

Revelations at Wednesday's Benghazi hearings in Congress were ""just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Admiral James Lyons (Ret.). I caught up with Admiral Lyons, the former Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and senior U.S. military representative to the United Nations, at a press conference in Washington today, and asked him a few questions. ""We failed to protect those Americans who were under attack. There's no other way to describe it,"" said Lyons. Referring to the Obama administration's original story that it was the anti-Islam video that sparked a demonstration, which led to the murder of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, Lyons said, ""As Richard Nixon found out, you don't lie to the American public. Hopefully that theme will be picked up and carried on, and those that were perpetuating the lie will be held accountable. Resignation does come to mind.""

Back in January, I had a much longer discussion with the retired admiral, about Benghazi, Hillary Clinton's testimony and question, ""What difference does it make?,"" the Arab Spring, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Law of the Sea Treaty and much more.

On Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez delivered a speech at the House of Representatives addressing a verbal attack she received by her Republican colleague, Congressman Ted Yoho of Florida, two days prior. Yoho called Ocasio-Cortez a ‚Äúfucking bitch‚Äù on the steps of Capitol Hill. He was reportedly furious that Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged the correlation between crime and societal neglect and said that ‚Äúpolicing is not a solution to crime‚Äù during a virtual town hall in June. Yoho also called Ocasio-Cortez ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù and ‚Äúout of [her] freaking mind.‚Äù

593,"Investigative reporter Dylan Howard on his recent deep dives into Michael Jackson and Jeffrey Epstein. Howard reacted to the arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell, and President Trump's decision to wish her well during a press conference last month.

He also discussed broader patterns of elite corruption, especially as those patterns relate to sex crimes.

In recent years, Howard has become entangled in several high-profile controversies. The New York Post reported in April, ""In addition to silencing women‚Äôs allegations of affairs with Trump, Howard also was alleged in the Ronan Farrow‚Äôs Pulitzer Prize winning book 'Catch and Kill' to have helped disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein dig up dirt on his accusers."" Howard has threatened to sue Farrow for defamation. Jeff Bezos accused Howard of trying to blackmail him in 2019.

Howard has battled sexual harassment allegations against himself as well, all of which he denies.

The conversation focused primarily on his reporting on Jackson, Epstein, and Maxwell, but Howard said he doesn't read much of what's written about himself in the press. ""A lot of the criticism of me is like water off a duck's back,"" he said.

Howard is the author of Bad: An Unprecedented Investigation into the Michael Jackson Cover-Up, available HERE: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088FXVXRT/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i3

""I'm not arguing something that is novel or strange,"" Wood said, noting that the landing of the pilgrims at Plymouth Rock and Mayflower Compact are some of the most historically significant events that occurred at that time in America. ""Anyone who has paid reasonable attention to American history knows this already.""

""We now tend to treat the pilgrims and Plymouth Colony as an effort to tear away from the Indians their native rights to the lands and hunting grounds to stimulate war and oppression,"" he continued. ""So pilgrims have fallen into the same wastebasket of history that a lot of other important elements have in our history.""

Long argued the hypocrisy of woke white women demanding change for women and transgenders has moved the political conversation far away from the original discussion of police brutality and racial equality. The left, more generally, has taken an issue that began with a specific need for change and escalated it to involve many unrelated, larger issues.

""The Last Pope?"" is a documentary from WND that travels to Rome, Geneva, Belfast and the U.S. to discover the story of venerated Irish prophet St. Malachy. Lost away inside the Vatican archives for 400 years, Malachy‚Äôs Prophecy of the Popes emerged in the late 1500s at a time of great papal upheaval. Heralded at the time as a miraculous development, the origin and early years of the prophecy are cloaked in murky mysticism. According to the Prophecy of the Popes, a time of vast biblical significance is now at hand. ""The Last Pope?"" includes medieval historians, Vatican-affiliated experts, authors (including Tom Horn and Chris Putman, co-authors of ""Petrus Romanus: The Last Pope Is Here"") and others. From Ireland to Italy, ""The Last Pope?"" tells a riveting story of eschatological intrigue.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://www.theepochtimes.com/coronavirus
------------------
The Epoch Times interviewed a Wuhan resident trapped at home for 40 days. Aid is not available. With two young children, the money is running out, and the door was nailed shut from outside, despite the fact that they are not infected. The despair is hard to imagine.

In the interview, victims of the coronavirus epidemic were said to be cremated while still alive.

Mr. Pan: Some time ago, a friend of mine told me that people aged in their seventies, were packed in body bags while still alive and sent to a crematorium. I am also afraid of this.

Journalist: Did this happen to your friend?

Mr. Pan: My friend told me of a family living next to my father's building, the entire family is dead! Extinct! My classmate is also dead. It took four days, from going to hospital to his death. This is what happened around me. Just 96 hours from going to hospital to the crematorium. We ate and drank together prior to the new year, and now he's dead. His father is isolated, and his mother is seriously ill. Once you are infected, it kills the entire family. We call it ""Tuan Mie"". (It means as a whole?) This is Wuhan dialect.

Journalist: I saw a video saying that living people were put into body bags. Many people questioned it. Could this be the case?

Mr. Pan: My friend went to the Hankou funeral home on the night of the third and fourth day of the Chinese New Year and sent a video. Six of 30 cremators were working, with 20 staff working overtime. My friend went to see about the final arrangements for his relative who had died and accidentally recorded these things. I have the video on my phone. But that‚Äôs over now. The question I'm facing now is how do I live?

Journalist: But all he saw was the cremation of the dead. None of those undead, right?

Mr. Pan: He asked the person in the funeral home, and he said there was screaming in the cremator (Screaming in the cremator). It was at night, he heard the screaming. Screaming from inside the cremators.

Journalist: Too horrible. Can you give me the video?

Mr. Pan: I can't give it to you I don‚Äôt know how. The body bags are piled up by the door. More than a dozen trash cans are full, it‚Äôs all on video. The question is how do we survive? We are in the epidemic area, the disaster area, and are called victims. In the next step, we will become refugees. But when we die, we are [Expletive].

Cremating living people was exposed online shortly after the regime imposed lockdown began in Wuhan. Even Wuhan doctors were saying there were too many dead people crying at night.

On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Senior Editor Chris Bedford joins Host Ben Domenech to analyze night two of the Republican National Convention. Together, they outline the strengths and weaknesses of the speakers and production at the RNC as well as what to look forward to on night three.

According to Bedford and Domenech, many of the speeches Tuesday night were concise, hard-hitting, and focusing on the right issues.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm thoroughly impressed ‚Ä¶ it was shocking how courageous some of these decisions were,‚Äù Bedford said. 

While the Democratic National Convention lacked substance in their messaging, Domenech says that the RNC and the White House delivered, offering a wide range of speeches covering religious freedom, pro-life, media bias, and more.

‚ÄúOne of the virtues of the Trump people at‚Äìlarge is that because they have no experience in politics before a handful of years ago, they don‚Äôt have any of the built-in consultant based bias that says, this is the thing you say loud and this is the thing you whisper. And so they say everything at the same volume, which is 11,‚Äù said Domenech.

751,"A documentary film crew travels to Greece to capture the perspectives of new arrivals.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the human mind is able to understand the suffering we‚Äôve experienced,‚Äù says a man in Matthew K. Firpo‚Äôs short documentary, Refuge. Filmed on location in 2016 in four different refugee camps across Greece‚Äîoutside Athens and on the islands of Lesvos and Leros‚Äîthe film allows victims of the Syrian Civil War to share their experiences. One man describes how his sewing factory was completely destroyed, leaving him penniless and starving. Another man says he was jailed and tortured for attempting to distribute food; his brother was killed shortly thereafter. Some lost everyone and everything. ‚ÄúWherever I went in Syria, I saw the injured and the dead,‚Äù yet another refugee recounts. For Firpo and his production team, Refuge was a passion project fueled by ‚Äúwanting to know more about the people living these headlines. I wanted to know more about their stories, about what they had lost, what they had left behind, and where they hoped their lives were headed. While news coverage focused on the problem, it often forgot about the human being.‚Äù

808,"On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, bestselling author, journalist, and environmental activist Michael Shellenberger joins host Ben Domenech to discuss climate alarmism and how the left-wing media and activists have distorted the urgency of climate change. Shellenberger just published his most recent book, ‚ÄúApocalypse Never: Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All,‚Äù this month.

Shellenberger condemned the left‚Äôs journalists, climate activists, and malthusian scientists for promoting climate alarmism. The radical left has taken an immoral position by denying vast, inexpensive energy sources to all people, he said, which they consider to be the moral center of apocalyptic environmentalism.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not in a life boat. We have functionally infinite energy, and there‚Äôs no resource scarcity to speak of. And in fact that kind of discourse has always been used to deprive people of prosperity,‚Äù he said.

868,"Fired former National Security Advisor John Bolton, who released an anti-Trump book earlier this year that sought to offer one last breath into the Democrats‚Äô February impeachment hopes, debunked The Atlantic hit piece published Thursday. The magazine‚Äôs story relied entirely on anonymous sources to charge the president with making disparaging remarks on WWI veterans.

Thursday night, Atlantic Editor in Chief Jeffrey Goldberg offered new allegations on why the president didn‚Äôt visit the graves of fallen WWI soldiers on a 2018 trip to France, which the White House has continued to claim was due to inclement weather.

‚ÄúWhen President Donald Trump canceled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris in 2018, he blamed the rain for the last-minute decision, saying ‚Äòthe helicopter couldn‚Äôt fly‚Äô and that the Secret Service wouldn‚Äôt drive him there. Neither claim was true,‚Äù Jeffrey Goldberg wrote without a single source on record. ‚ÄúTrump rejected the idea of the visit because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain, and because he did not believe it important to honor American war dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy should I go to that cemetery?‚Äù Trump reportedly said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs filled with losers.‚Äù

The president also allegedly issued more derogatory comments related to long-time rival McCain, telling White House staff in 2018 following the Arizona senator‚Äôs death ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not going to support that loser‚Äôs funeral,‚Äù three years after telling an auditorium audience on the campaign trail in 2015 that McCain was ‚Äúnot a war hero.‚Äù

Bolton‚Äôs book however, offered a different narrative of events falling in line with the official White House claims for the last-minute cancellation in France.

‚ÄúThe weather was bad, and Kelly and I spoke about whether to travel as planned to the Chateau-Thierry Belleau Wood monuments and nearby American Cemeteries, where many US World War I dead were buried,‚Äù Bolton wrote.

------------------------------------
In mid-April, Sweden ended all cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party's Confucius Institutes, becoming the first country in Europe to cut all ties with the politically-minded program. Swedish politicians said that this was not only a result of the Confucius Institute's conflicting values, but also the result of the CCP‚Äôs ‚Äúwolf warrior‚Äù diplomacy in recent years.

In mid-April, a Sveriges Radio survey revealed that several Swedish cities had ended their cooperation with their sister cities in China, and canceled all Confucius Institute and Confucius Classroom initiatives. Member of the Swedish Parliament, Hans Rothenberg said: ‚ÄúIt's very nice that Sweden, as the first country (in Europe), took such a response. The Confucius Institute went unnoticed when it first entered Sweden, but then it came to our attention, because it was revealed as being incompatible with our free and independent values in education and research. They're imposing their own values on others, and that's not something we can tolerate in this free and open country. It is especially intolerable to a free and open education system.‚Äù 

Former Vice President of PACE (The Council of Europe), G√∂ran Lindblad, said: ‚ÄúThe Confucius Institute resembles an old tradition, a bad tradition from the Mussolini Fascist regime in Italy, establishing institutes for language all over. And they were centrals for spying, and for influence. So the Confucius Institutes are actually influential institutes, they try to influence the students in the universities and also in the schools, in order to teach Chinese, spread the Chinese ways, so they are also teaching politics, and they say it‚Äôs a brainwashing system, and that‚Äôs bad. And (they) also use it to find out  things about the system in the country where they are.‚Äù

In recent years, the ‚Äúwolf warrior‚Äù diplomacy used by the Chinese ambassador to Sweden has caused widespread resentment among Swedes, and the deadlock between the two countries has only intensified. (Video note: (Three Swedish parties demanded that the CCP Ambassador to Sweden, Gui ZCongyou, be declared as an ‚Äúunwelcome person"" and expelled from the country). Professor of Department of Economy and Society at the University of Gothenburg, Lars Nordstr√∂m, said: ‚ÄúThe CCP ambassador has very little credibility in Sweden because he is very tough on some issues, for example, on issues regarding writers‚Äô publications, and arrests of dissidents, regardless of the fact that he is a Swedish citizen. Also, he did not explain why this epidemic was spreading so rapidly from China.‚Äù 

Member of the Swedish Parliament, Hans Rothenberg said: ‚ÄúThe Chinese ambassador did not help form a good atmosphere in the relationship between the two countries at all, as he communicated through threats and accusations. This made it very difficult for the two parties to get along. In recent years, we have all seen the CCP ambassador's words have become increasingly malicious. This has very unfortunately led to the worsening of relations between Sweden and China.‚Äù

928,"What's your general term for a sweetened carbonated beverage? What word or words do you use to address a group of two or more people? What do you call it when the rain falls while the sun is shining?

Former Harvard professor Bert Vaux asked tens of thousands of people across the U.S. these questions and released the results as the 2003 Harvard Dialect Survey. The data are fascinating; they reveal patterns of migration, unexpected linguistic kinships between regions, and the awesome variety of words we say and how we say them.

The study has wormed its way into popular consciousness and periodically morphs into a meme (just search ""accent tag"" on YouTube). Last summer, North Carolina State University graduate student Joshua Katz turned Vaux's geographical data into a set of stunning heat maps that went viral.

For the video above, we called people across the country to ask them a few of Vaux's questions, then layered the answers with maps based on Katz's. You'll hear what Philadelphians call a group of people, the many ways of pronouncing ""pecan,"" and what Southerners mean when they say ""the devil is beating his wife.""

To delve deeper into the world of dialects,  check out Vaux's original study, Katz's maps, and the Phonological Atlas of North American English. See also Deborah Fallows' writing on language across the country for the American Futures project. Thanks to FoBoGro and the Johnson Casket Company for their help.

What we found is shocking: navigators, in positions of public trust, told our undercover journalists to lie and defraud the government. Over and over again.

Yes, as if the roll-out of Obamacare hasn't been disastrous enough, Project Veritas has caught Obamacare navigators counseling citizens to lie about their income and deceive the IRS, commit fraud on applications by not reporting full health history, and worse.

Despite reassurances that ""fraud could not be committed,"" clearly, that is not the case.

Obamacare Navigators counseled applicants by saying:

""You lie because your premiums will be higher.""

""Never report it ... I always lie on my applications.""

""It didn't happen.""

Hubei was once known as the ‚ÄúThousand Lake Province.‚Äù In the past two decades, many lakes and wetlands, which helped to store excessive rain water, disappeared due to aggressive urban development. As a result, Wuhan always floods during rainy seasons in recent years.

Daily Signal foreign correspondent Nolan Peterson explains, despite the media‚Äôs quickness to point out our country's shortcomings ‚Äî America is actually seen as a force for good and freedom around the world.

Full transcript: 

We hear a lot of negative news around the world about some of our country's failings, but I think we don't hear enough about the positive things our country does. And the unique promise that our country holds for people who are fighting for a better future.

My name is Nolan Peterson. I'm the foreign correspondent for The Daily Signal.

I help tell stories from various places around the world, and hopefully stories that many Americans aren't aware of.

I think it's important for Americans to know the truth about the world outside our borders. The threats that face our nation, and the uniquely positive reputation that our country has abroad.
 
I've seen first hand from many places around the world, how America is seen as a force for good and beacon of hope for people fighting for their freedom. 

On a battlefield in Eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian soldiers raised an American flag to irritate their enemies. And I even saw a Ukrainian soldier wearing a Ronald Regan Presidential Library tee shirt. 

In the summer of 2015, I was on the roof of a Kurdish Peshmerga fort overlooking Mosul. And I watched American war planes bombing ISIS targets. And the soldier beside me was a Kurdish Peshmerga general. And he had survived the Al-Anfal Genocide when Saddam Hussein's jets had dropped chemical weapons on the Kurds. And after that, for this old soldier, the sound of jet engines had terrified him. 

But on that night, as we watched American war planes bomb his enemy, he told me that it was a sound of God that he was hearing. And I think that's the kind of story that Americans should hear and be proud of.",1,The Daily Signal

The U.S. Department of Justice announced on May 11 that Dr. Xiao-Jiang Li, a Chinese professor, was sentenced for concealing his participation in the CCP ‚ÄúThousand Talents Program‚Äù and for not reporting this foreign income in his federal income tax returns over several years.
 
Another participant of the ‚ÄúThousand Talents Program,‚Äù Simon Ang, a Chinese professor specializing in electrical engineering at the University of Arkansas, was arrested for wire fraud.
 
Li was sentenced to one year of probation on a felony charge and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $35,089. He was also ordered to file lawful income tax returns for the years 2012 through 2018 within the first two months of his probation and fully cooperate with the IRS to make a complete and accurate determination of all taxes, penalties, and interest that he owed.
 
According to the documents released by the Department of Justice, starting in 2012 and continuing until 2018, Li, while still working at Emory University doing research on the use of large animal models to investigate Huntington‚Äôs disease, among other things, also worked for two Chinese universities: at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and then at Jinan University conducting similar large animal model research. Over those six years, Li earned at least $500,000 in foreign income that he didn‚Äôt report on his federal income tax returns.

‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Recruitment of Overseas High-Level Talent‚Äù program, also called the ‚ÄúThousand Talents Program‚Äù was established by the central government of China (the CCP) in 2008 to recognize and recruit leading international experts in the fields of science, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Experts are hired by many universities and research institutions in China so that the CCP can gain research results.

The U.S. Department of Justice announced on the same day that another participant of the ‚ÄúThousand Talents Program,‚Äù Simon S. Ang, an electrical engineering professor and researcher at the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville, was arrested for allegedly committing wire fraud. If convicted, he will face up to 20 years in prison.

Since 2019, the U.S. National Institute of Health has been investigating 55 institutions across the United States, and a number of Chinese scholars have been charged with participating in the ""Thousand Talents Program,"" leaking U.S. classified information and scientific research results.

On the fourth anniversary of the South China Sea Arbitration between the Philippines and China, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo released a statement clearly indicating that ‚ÄúBeijing‚Äôs claims to offshore resources across most of the South China Sea are completely unlawful‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe PRC has no lawful territorial or maritime claim to (or derived from) James Shoal.‚Äù

U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper emphasized that the U.S. Navy will defend the freedom of international navigation and will not stand idly by as the Chinese Communist Party violates international law by creating provocations. 

Dr. Tian Yuan, a Chinese commentator on current affairs, believes that the Trump administration has changed its previous neutral position on the issues of the South China Sea and put the United States in a position to enforce the international arbitration tribunal‚Äôs ruling.

In early July, the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) began a 5-day military exercise in the disputed Paracel Islands. Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam have condemned the CCP for creating regional tensions. After that, the U.S. Navy sent two powerful aircraft carriers, the ‚ÄúUSS Ronald‚Äù and ‚ÄúUSS Nimitz‚Äù to conduct exercises in the South China Sea in celebration of the U.S. Independence Day and to support the free opening of the Indo-Pacific region.

Zheng Hao-Chang, a Chinese commentator on current affairs residing in the U.S., believes that although both sides are experiencing increasing military tensions, given the incompetence of the CCP, it's unlikely that the CCP will confront the United States head-on.

After a low level Wuhan official was blamed for failing to contain the CCP virus within his jurisdiction and removed from his post, Wuhan authorities issued an order to have all residents take a diagnostic test. In the past few days, several asymptomatic patients have been identified from various communities.

As a result, in one community, a popular grocery store was closed, and in another community, hundreds of neighbors were quarantined and all residents were forbidden to leave the compound. 

In Weibin Fresh, a popular grocery store in Wuhan, an employee was found to be an asymptomatic carrier of the CCP virus. A group of guards in black uniforms blocked the store entrance, holding anti-riot steel forks and shields in their hands. 
Customers who were blocked outside felt very sad, because it is the local seniors‚Äô favorite store. 
-
At Wuhan‚Äôs Sanmin Community, where several new cases were reported, many police arrived at the entrance to block residents leaving the compound. 
-
Inside the community, residents were lined up to be tested.

The person who posted the video revealed that 13 residents tested positive for COVID-19, and more than 300 have been quarantined.
-
Overseas Chinese rights activists Yang Zhanqing shared a group chat message from Sanmin Community on May 11, which said:
‚ÄúThere are more than 40 high-rise buildings and about 1,000 households in our community. Now, the entire community is under lockdown again, nearly 5,000 residents are all forbidden to go out. That means, many contractors may lose their jobs.

‚ÄúIn addition, everyone‚Äôs health barcode has turned red, which means all of them are identified as high risk individuals,‚Äù the message said, referring to the ‚ÄúAlipay health code‚Äù app that is being enforced on all Chinese citizens to monitor their health and travel history.

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

1042,"On July 4, 2017, North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that had serious ramifications for the United States.

The missile test seemed to be on every front page in mainland America that day.

Here's a throwback to when Walter Williams sat down with us to share some wisdom and discuss why policies of economic freedom empower individuals to rise and better their own lives. 

Upon his passing, Kay C. James ‚Äî president of The Heritage Foundation ‚Äî said of Williams, ""[his] voice and knowledge extended beyond the classroom... He authored 10 books and hundreds of articles for scholarly journals. He also found time to serve on the boards of many think tanks and organizations. As a member of our advisory board, Walter frequently contributed to our publications, offering his sage advice on economic topics of the day. Whatever the venue‚Äîincluding his nationally syndicated newspaper column or in Congressional hearing rooms‚ÄîWalter was never shy about criticizing public policies he believed were harmful to economic growth and to the minority groups they were supposed to benefit.‚Äù

1088,"Vera Golobeva spent more than six years in one of Stalin‚Äôs Gulag camps. Her crime? ‚ÄúTo this day, I still don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she says. In a new documentary, Golobeva remembers the excruciating details of her imprisonment. When she was arrested, along with her father, mother, and sister, Golobeva was taken to KGB headquarters and tortured. She was eight months pregnant. ‚ÄúI felt as if they were burying me alive,‚Äù she says in the film. The worst was yet to come. 

Between 1918 and 1987, Soviet Russia operated a vast network of hundreds of prison camps that held up to 10,000 people each. When Stalin launched his infamous purges in 1936, millions of so-called political prisoners were arrested and transported to the Gulag without trial. The first wave of prisoners were military or government officials; later, ordinary citizens‚Äîespecially intellectuals, doctors, writers, artists, and scientists‚Äîwere arrested ex nihilo. At the camps, many prisoners were executed or died from overwork and malnutrition. The death rate often hovered around 5 percent, although in years of widespread famine, mortality could be as high as 25 percent. Historians estimate that as part of the Gulag, Soviet authorities imprisoned or executed around 25 million people. Read more: https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/607546/gulag-stories-russia/

------------------
Hi, my name is Tatiana Darzi and welcome to Epoch Times Exclusive.

I‚Äôd like to share a couple of videos recently trending online  regarding the situation in China with the novel coronavirus.

https:www.youtube.comwatch?v=X7hP2jmGGVM
A video taken in Guangdong Province shows police standing in front of someone‚Äôs doorway,  demanding the residents to not spread information  about the novel Coronavirus online.  The Chinese regime doesn‚Äôt want  the truth to be spread to the rest of the world. So,  it sends the police force to censor and intimidate civilians speaking out about this.

https:www.youtube.comwatch?v=6R1PMiUFDcE
25-year-old, Li Zehua, is a former TV host  with Chinese State Television, CCTV.

He recorded himself being chased by an intelligence officer who was driving a vehicle that wasn‚Äôt a police car.  He later live streamed himself  informing the officers and the viewers that  he refuses to be silenced by the CCP and is determined to ‚Äúspeak the truth‚Äù. He goes on to explain that speaking the truth doesn‚Äôt mean he wants to overthrow the government.

He states he‚Äôs been a good citizen and hasn‚Äôt broken any laws,  he also mentions that the young people in China ‚Äúknow nothing  about the truth and the real history‚Äù of their country.

Soon after, the police are seen walking into his apartment to arrest him. No one has heard from him  since February 26.

The CCP actively cracks down on freedom of speech, and it isn‚Äôt unusual for dissidents to get arrested and in many cases,  never to be heard from again.

https:www.youtube.comwatch?v=ibvURrLbRd4
A man was returning to China when two women briefly stopped him to inform him of the coronavirus outbreak. The women tell him that what CCTV has published is fake and that the epidemic has become widespread in China. He doesn't seem to be fazed by this. He says  that he trusts what the Chinese State Media publishes,  and then leaves.

The amount of disinformation by the Chinese Communist Party is extremely dangerous to the people living in China and for the rest of us living abroad. If it were up to the CCP,  they would‚Äôve never told us about the outbreak. But since the news was spreading about as fast as the virus had spread,  they had no other choice but to admit to it.

It‚Äôs thanks to those brave people who do care about the wellbeing of others, who dared to inform us about the novel coronavirus, and fully understand that by doing so, the CCP  will retaliate against them. 

Thank you for joining me today in this Epoch Times Exclusive. Don‚Äôt forget to Like, Subscribe,  but most of all Share this program with friends and family  to keep them informed. See you next time!

The spring feasts ‚Äì or appointed times ‚Äì were fulfilled by the first coming of Yeshua, the Hebrew name of Jesus, which means ‚ÄúSalvation.‚Äù The fall feasts will be fulfilled by His Second Coming ‚Äì in the very near future, explains Biltz in an engaging, informative and entertaining series of teachings you will want to watch again and again and share with your friends, relatives and fellow believers.

Biltz emphasizes that these feasts, described in Leviticus, were not intended for the Jewish people alone. They are repeatedly referred to in the Bible as ‚Äúthe Lord‚Äôs feasts‚Äù ‚Äì meaning they are for all people. They are meant to be observed as well as to serve as signs of the times in which we live ‚Äì reminders of the greatest events of the past and foreshadowings of the future.

A feast is defined as ‚Äúan appointment, i.e., a fixed time or season; also a signal (as appointed beforehand).‚Äù Filled with specific scriptural references, word studies and a historical explanation of the real significance of the feasts of the Old Testament.

Biltz says much of the church is asleep ‚Äì unaware of the significance of the feasts on God‚Äôs holy time clock. The feasts were not intended to be abandoned by believers after the coming of Jesus. His followers observed them in the first century. It‚Äôs time to discover them again as the hour of His return approaches.

1115,"Who Will Kneel for You: Artists Speak Out

Anna Deavere Smith and a chorus of artists recite ""To Kneel"" by Kathy Engel in support of 2018 NFL protest, the right to dissent, and against racist police violence.""


To Kneel

 

The black men who make wages

from the brutal banging of the skull,

pounding of the knees, arms

reaching like branches in the long

arc of a pass, now kneel.

The muscles of their souls,

the soles of their cleats, stretch

of thighs speak. Fans and refs yell,

commentators jabber and behold:

one knee, hand to ground,


they kneel, the weight

of their built- up bodies 

pulled earthward as if called 

by those from before 

to kneel now, refusing to salute

this country‚Äôs killing field. 

Those with the heart to be the lonely

first; their knees sing. Jobs at stake,

they kneel for the inheritors. For the future

dignity of bodies to choose to stand

or touch down. And the joining, too --

some, then flocks, arms threaded,

waving flags of jersey-ed bodies,

an anthem, for the uncountable ‚Äì 

to be counted. And to those

who drop to the knee

only in the recesses of a locked

back room or those who switch and bait

in the light, amid the throngs ‚Äì or those 

who hide behind their whiteness ‚Äì


who will be there to kneel for you

when such a time comes, as it will

come? What will you say when

your children or your grandchildren,

their friends or lovers ask

what parts of your bodies 

touched the ground

in the moment of loyalty,

or the moment of betrayal?

What would I say?

@Kathy Engel, 2017

Statement from PEN America:

The right to dissent is a constitutionally protected and fundamentally American value. This past year, as NFL players faced pressure from the President and a number of Team Owners, PEN America rallied with a coalition of organizations to defend the players' rights to protest racial injustice and police brutality. We collected over 130,000 signatures in solidarity. We organized a public action outside the Fall Owners' Meeting, days after the President's insistence on a league-sanctioned end to the protests. Just before Thanksgiving, the NFL announced they would be committing $100 million to social justice initiatives. But the work of protecting dissent in our democracy continues.

Join PEN America today to help defend this critical right: http://pen.org/membership

‚ÄúWhen you encounter danger in other countries, don't give up! Remember, there is a strong nation behind you‚Äîyour motherland!"" 

Presently, overseas Chinese trying to return to China amid the pandemic are blocked from entry by Chinese authorities. Some vent their anger on director Wu Jing.

Wu Jing, you [expletive], can you take me home? I have a Chinese passport. Help me return to China? Stop acting like an agitated fool!

Conclusion: Similar situation was also reported for Chinese in the Philippines.

In early April, dozens of Chinese in Nepal were seen yelling outside the Chinese embassy, demanding that Chinese authorities grant them their basic rights as Chinese citizens.

1125,"On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, civil rights activist Bob Woodson joined host Ben Domenech to discuss the racism behind the left‚Äôs new ‚Äúanti-racist‚Äù activism. Woodson is the Founder and President of the Woodson Center, where you can learn more about his work on the 1776 Project.

Woodson said the message of the New York Times‚Äô 1619 Project takes advantage of specifically low-income black communities and falsely attributes their problems, namely the violence and brokenness of cities, as being external. The ideas lead essayist Hannah Nikole-Jones and her colleagues at the New York Times presented are ‚Äúahistorical,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúI was really outraged that they would hijack the rich legacy of the civil rights movement and use it as a bludgeon to denigrate this country and engage in such hypocrisy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd it really was disgusting and very damaging because of the message it sends to very vulnerable areas of the black community.‚Äù

1186,"On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Shelby Steele joins host Ben Domenech to discuss the state of the nation and the underlying historical causes into modern tensions. Steele is a renowned author, expert, and Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution specializing in the study of race relations, multiculturalism, and affirmative action.

Steele argues today‚Äôs racial tensions are caused by an outgrowth of a change in racial understanding from the 1960s. The ‚Äô60s, he said, produced a ‚Äúredemptive liberalism‚Äù in an effort to rid America of past experiences of racism, particularly on the left. The recent trend of corporations publicly declaring their support of Black Lives Matter reveals the incessant desire to be innocent of the past.

‚ÄúThe left has discovered that there‚Äôs enormous power in claiming to be redemptive, claiming and putting yourself on the side of the good. And so the left always is a constant scream of political correctness and do-gooders in one kind or another and claiming the mantle of power in order to say ‚ÄòWe will redeem America. We will be the ones who make America achieve its dreams of equity for all.'‚Äù

1206,"Accuracy in Media covered a March 20 anti-war demonstration in Lafayette Square Park, across the street from the White House. AIM went there to see what sort of activity was occurring, and as we show in this video, which was all shot at the scene of the demonstration, it was a mix of 9/11 Truthers, Code Pinkers, socialists, anarchists, and a large contingency of pro-Hamas, anti-Israel zealots. 

The Washington Post covered it, but never mentioned the name Obama, though he was clearly a target of the protesters. The group that organized the protest, International ANSWER, claims there were 10,000 people there. Our estimate: 2 - 3 thousand tops, at least prior to the marching part of the demonstration. We didn't stick around for that part. 

One thing for sure, no one burned an American flag at any Tea Party gatherings, but they sure did here. Did you see any reporting about the hate-speech and flag burning? I guess MSNBC was too busy that day.

In the piece, Libby, also a senior contributor at the Federalist, wrote: ""What my son heard was that he is racist and doesn‚Äôt even know it, and that his parents and grandparents provided this legacy to him. I told him that we need to treat all people with respect, kindness, and with a generosity of heart, and that skin colour is not indicative of a person‚Äôs heart.

The second part of the lesson took place the following school day. The teachers recapped Friday‚Äôs lesson, saying that white people are more likely to get a job, a house, and a decent education than a black person, because this has been 'built into our system for generations and generations.'

This time they showed videos from The New York Times. The final video shows a series of self-flagellating white people who twist themselves into pretzel shapes to try to imagine that they are both not racist and very, very racist at the same time.""

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

1245,"Use PROMO CODE DylanYT to receive 20% off when you purchase Bob Dylan: A Spiritual Life from the WND Superstore: http://superstore.wnd.com/Bob-Dylan-A-Spiritual-Life-Hardcover

Never before has a book like this one delved into the spiritual odyssey of cultural icon Bob Dylan. Tracking an American original‚Äîfrom his Jewish roots to his controversial embrace of Jesus to his enduring legacy as the composer of the Tempest album‚ÄîBob Dylan: A Spiritual Life delivers the story of a man in dogged pursuit of redemption.

Based on years of research and original interviews, this book sorts through the myths and misunderstandings and reveals Dylan to be both traditional and radical in the way he expresses his spiritual quest for purpose and meaning. ""Call Dylan whatever you want, but the name won‚Äôt stick,"" said foreword writer and film director Scott Derrickson. ""What does stick is his music, in part because his songs contain a deep, abiding spirituality that moves listeners like me more than the songs of any other artist.""

Bob Dylan: A Spiritual Life bridges the gap between purpose and meaning in grand fashion. It offers readers an informative, entertaining, and nuanced look into Bob Dylan‚Äôs spiritual odyssey. Today, there is not a Dylan book in existence that exclusively focuses on his spiritual odyssey through years of research and original interviews. An exclusive, in-depth interview with Carol Dennis, Dylan‚Äôs former wife, provides an absolutely unique feature to the book. Until now, Dennis has never publicly spoken at length about her former husband.

The government of Luolong District in Luoyang City, Henan Province, issued a notice in May that it will relocate the subordinate Liu Fu Village for two months. The villagers indicated that the relocation procedure is totally illegal. Some residents even took gas tanks up to their roofs to protest the forced demolitions.

The notice also mentioned that those who do not cooperate in the relocation will be dealt with in accordance with the law. However, the residents of Liu Fu Village indicated that the local government did not follow legal procedures in the relocation.

Residents of Liu Fu Village have gone to the State Council of China and left messages at Henan Provincial Government Website and Provincial Disciplinary Commission Website to reflect the problem, but there is no reply as yet. Mr. Li indicated that violent demolition and relocation happen too often, they really don‚Äôt know where to go to find solutions.

1283,"After police thwarted their attempt to topple the Andrew Jackson statue in Lafayette Square outside the White House, Black Lives Matter demonstrators spent the rainy night of June 23 agitating, screaming obscenities at officers, setting fires, and more.

Law enforcement later removed the Black House Autonomous Zone encampment from St. John's Church, where antifascists and others had set up tents. Protesters clashed with police again the next day, returning to taunt and shout at them, sometimes with a face mask, sometimes not. A white woman in Lululemon leggings mocked a black female police officer. A black office stood stoically for minutes while protesters yelled directly in his face. 

This footage was captured by Emily Jashinsky of The Federalist.

1296,"‚ÄúI came here to get a PhD in American literature, and here I am, with pictures of American writers on the wall‚Äîa chess vendor.‚Äù

That‚Äôs Imad Khachan, owner of Chess Forum, the only remaining chess shop in New York City. A Palestinian refugee with no family of his own, Khachan has become ‚Äúthe father of everybody‚Äù to a community of chess enthusiasts, those curious to learn more about the game, and those whom Khachan describes as the city‚Äôs ‚Äúinvisible people.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen no other place will welcome you, you have a seat [here],‚Äù Khachan says in Lonelyleap's short documentary, King of the Night. The film depicts the chess shop as more than a home for chess players; Khachan‚Äôs open-door policy has provided refuge for many patrons with difficult lives at home. According to Molly Brass, one of the film‚Äôs directors, some Chess Forum regulars have no home at all.

‚ÄúThere are very few places in New York that accept and welcome anyone‚Äîreally anyone‚Äîto sit and spend as many hours as they want to, at negligible or no cost,‚Äù Brass told The Atlantic. ‚ÄúIt's almost a revolutionary idea at this point.‚Äù

Soh compiled her research in her recent book, ‚ÄúThe End of Gender: Debunking the Myths about Sex and Identity in Our Society.‚Äù

Soh said she‚Äôs grateful to no longer be in the academic world, where everyone is required to accept so many scientific mistruths as facts. As a liberal herself, Soh said the evolution of gender identity has been used by the radical left to further a narrative that‚Äôs harmful to children and not based in science.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beyond ‚Äògender is a social construct,‚Äô then it stretched to ‚Äògender‚Äôs a spectrum,‚Äô then suddenly since then it has also stretched to encompass biological sex,‚Äù Soh said. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this has become mainstream. As you mentioned, people will cite this as though this is factual and it‚Äôs just taken for granted now, but it‚Äôs absolutely incorrect.‚Äù

Still haven‚Äôt subscribed to The New Yorker on YouTube ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫

The Streets of Paris Under Quarantine | The New Yorker",0,The New Yorker
1321,"One day after a prominent U.S. Muslim leader reacted to the November 2015 Paris attacks with a declaration that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has nothing to do with Islam, President Obama made the same assertion.

Who exactly is the enemy we face, not only in the Middle East but also within our borders? Is it ""murderers without a coherent creed"" or ""nihilistic killers who want to tear things down,"" as some described ISIS after 130 people were brutally slain and another 368 injured in a coordinated attack on Western soil that authorities say was organized with help from inside France's Muslim communities.

After the Paris attacks, Obama, himself, described ISIS as ""simply a network of killers who are brutalizing local populations.""

But how much do words and definitions really matter? According to the legendary military strategist Sun Tzu, if ""you do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one (battle) and lose one; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.""

When the Department of Homeland Security was founded in 2003, its stated purpose was ""preventing terrorist attacks within the United States and reducing America's vulnerability to terrorism."" The Bush administration's definition of the enemy as a tactic, terrorism, rather than a specific movement, proved consequential amid a culture of political correctness. By the time President Obama took office, Muslim Brotherhood-linked leaders in the United States were forcing changes to national security policy and even being invited into the highest chambers of influence. A policy known as Countering Violent Extremism emerged, downplaying the threat of supremacist Islam as unrelated to the religion and just one among many violent ideological movements.

When recently retired DHS frontline officer and intelligence expert Philip Haney bravely tried to say something about the people and organizations that threatened the nation, his intelligence information was eliminated, and he was investigated by the very agency assigned to protect the country. The national campaign by the DHS to raise public awareness of terrorism and terrorism-related crime known as If You See Something, Say Something effectively has become If You See Something, Say Nothing.

In ""See Something, Say Nothing,"" Haney ‚Äì a charter member of DHS with previous experience in the Middle East ‚Äì and co-author Art Moore expose just how deeply the submission, denial and deception run. Haney's insider, eyewitness account, supported by internal memos and documents, exposes a federal government capitulating to an enemy within and punishing those who reject its narrative.

Haney discloses:

How the Bush administration stripped him and other frontline officers of their ability to define the threat;
How much the Obama administration knew in advance of the Boston Marathon bombing and how it launched an ongoing cover-up on behalf of a major ally;
The administration‚Äôs stealth policy to protect Islamic leaders with supremacist beliefs and violent-jihadist ties, allowing them to freely travel between the U.S. and the Middle East;
The scope of access to the White House and the classified information the Obama administration gave to members of Muslim Brotherhood front groups;
The damning intelligence on Muslim Brotherhood-linked leaders invited to sit at the table and help form national-security policy;
The ""words matter"" memo imposing the demands of radical U.S. Muslims leaders on the DHS, including stripping intelligence and official communications of any mention of Islam in association with terrorism;
The purging of training material that casts Islam in a negative light;
The erasing and altering of vital intelligence on terrorists and terror threats;
The fear-based tactics imposed by the Muslim Brotherhood front groups in the U.S. and their accomplices that paralyze officials, members of Congress and any Department of Homeland Security employee who dares to expose or resist their agenda; and
Much more ‚Ä¶
In this well-documented, first-person account of his unique service with DHS, Haney shows why it's imperative that Americans demand that when they see something and say something, the servants under their charge do something to prevent a cunning, relentless enemy from carrying out its stated aim to ""destroy Western Civilization from within.""

1328,"This week is chock-full of opportunities for conservatives to seize and to move the ball forward on major issues. But thanks to impeachment distracting nearly every conservative, the Left will continue to win.¬†I explain how the Trump administration failed to push his promises on visas and arming soldiers on bases following the Pensacola attack. Trump‚Äôs secretary of defense, Mark Esper, could easily serve in a Democrat administration.¬†Also, New York is in a state of rebellion against immigration laws, and nobody is pushing for a budget fight against sanctuary cities. I explain the legal authority Trump has to fight back against them and what he should do. On the 246th¬†anniversary of the Boston Tea Party, we are left wondering where our protest movement is. Well, we can‚Äôt fight if we are distracted.¬†

The Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act on May 20, dropping a bomb on the Chinese stock market. The lawmakers who initiated the bill expressed hope that it would help prevent Chinese companies from committing fraud in the United States.

The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, sponsored by Republican Senator John Kennedy and Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, was passed by unanimous consent on May 21. According to the Act, securities of a company are prohibited from being listed on any of the U.S. securities exchanges if the company has failed to comply with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's (PCAOB) audits for three years in a row. Specifically, the bill requires a company to prove it‚Äôs not owned or controlled by a foreign government if the PCAOB is unable to audit specified reports because the company uses a foreign accounting firm not subject to inspection by the board.

John Kennedy, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, tweeted on May 20 that: ""It‚Äôs asinine we‚Äôre giving Chinese companies the chance to exploit hard working Americans because we don‚Äôt insist on examining their books. I hope the House sends this bill to POTUS to protect Americans and their savings."" 

Kennedy's tweet on Tuesday stated: ""The Chinese Communist Party cheats, and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act would stop them from cheating on U.S. stock exchanges. We can‚Äôt let foreign threats to Americans‚Äô retirement funds take root in our exchanges.""

Kennedy said in a statement: ""There are plenty of markets all over the world open to cheaters, but America can‚Äôt afford to be one of them.‚Äù

On May 20, Chinese technology stocks fell on the news, with Alibaba closing down more than 2% and Baidu down 1.12%. The credit history of China Concepts Stocks hasn‚Äôt been good. Chinese companies listed in the U.S., such as Luckin Coffee, also face increased scrutiny. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act still needs to be passed by the House of Representatives and signed by President Trump to become law.

A few days ago, Wang Xiaoqi, a web-based writer from China, published an article that exposes the decades-long history of China's two dairy giants, Mengniu and Yili. The article accuses these companies of adding various chemicals, such as fatty powder, whey powder, and melamine to their milk when their gross profits were as high as 70% or even 80%, making such practices a tacitly recognized hidden policy of the country‚Äôs major dairy enterprises.

The article also revealed that the two companies had pushed for changes in national dairy standards and lowered the quality and quantity requirements of milk products for their own benefit. The article also accused the two companies of having a poor production environment, deliberately raising the price of milk powder, exploiting dairy farmers, and neglecting the interests of consumers, resulting in a ""complete decay of China's dairy industry from its source to its end"".

Challenged over its vague ruling on a new ad targeting the Equality Act from the American Principles Project PAC, Politifact refuses to muster a serious defense of the decision, choosing instead to brush aside fair questions.

Maysak was the second typhoon to slam northeastern China and the Korean Peninsula in the past ten days.

Last week, Typhoon Bavi flooded roads and vehicles in China‚Äôs Liaoning Province along the coast on Aug. 27. Some regions in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia were also affected. 

It is very rare for a Typhoon to strike China‚Äôs northeastern regions. Bavi was the first typhoon that slammed Liaoning Province since 1964. Compared with Liaoning, which has a partial coastline, Heilongjiang and Jilin are further away from the open sea. It is therefore even more unusual for a Typhoon to hit these two provinces directly.


US Launches Ideological Counterattack; CCP Diplomats Are Restricted in US

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently announced restrictions on Chinese diplomats who will need approval from the U.S. to visit university campuses, meet with local government officials, and host any cultural events. Experts believe that this is an ideological counterattack from the U.S. against the CCP.

On September 2, the Secretary of State announced that ‚Äúthe Department of State will now require senior PRC diplomats in the United States to receive approval to visit U.S. university campuses and to meet with local government officials. Cultural events with an audience larger than 50 people hosted by the PRC embassy and consular posts outside of mission properties will also require Department of State approval.‚Äù

Pompeo said that ‚ÄúPRC authorities implement a system of opaque approval processes designed to prevent American diplomats from conducting regular business and connecting with the Chinese people.‚Äù The attempts from U.S. diplomats ‚Äúto host cultural events, secure official meetings, and visit university campuses are regularly obstructed.‚Äù Pompeo further explained that the reason why the U.S. demanded that all official PRC embassy and consular social media accounts be properly identified as PRC government accounts is because the U.S. Embassy is denied access to PRC social media and because Chinese citizens are blocked from using social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.

Pompeo also revealed that the next step taken by the U.S. will be to implement measures to prevent U.S. universities from CCP‚Äôs threats. On September 1, Pompeo indicated in an interview with Fox News that hopefully all Confucius Institutes will be removed from the U.S. by the end of the year.

1420,"One day after a prominent U.S. Muslim leader reacted to the November 2015 Paris attacks with a declaration that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has nothing to do with Islam, President Obama made the same assertion.

Who exactly is the enemy we face, not only in the Middle East but also within our borders? Is it ""murderers without a coherent creed"" or ""nihilistic killers who want to tear things down,"" as some described ISIS after 130 people were brutally slain and another 368 injured in a coordinated attack on Western soil that authorities say was organized with help from inside France's Muslim communities.

After the Paris attacks, Obama, himself, described ISIS as ""simply a network of killers who are brutalizing local populations.""

But how much do words and definitions really matter? According to the legendary military strategist Sun Tzu, if ""you do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one (battle) and lose one; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.""

When the Department of Homeland Security was founded in 2003, its stated purpose was ""preventing terrorist attacks within the United States and reducing America's vulnerability to terrorism."" The Bush administration's definition of the enemy as a tactic, terrorism, rather than a specific movement, proved consequential amid a culture of political correctness. By the time President Obama took office, Muslim Brotherhood-linked leaders in the United States were forcing changes to national security policy and even being invited into the highest chambers of influence. A policy known as Countering Violent Extremism emerged, downplaying the threat of supremacist Islam as unrelated to the religion and just one among many violent ideological movements.

When recently retired DHS frontline officer and intelligence expert Philip Haney bravely tried to say something about the people and organizations that threatened the nation, his intelligence information was eliminated, and he was investigated by the very agency assigned to protect the country. The national campaign by the DHS to raise public awareness of terrorism and terrorism-related crime known as If You See Something, Say Something effectively has become If You See Something, Say Nothing.

In ""See Something, Say Nothing,"" Haney ‚Äì a charter member of DHS with previous experience in the Middle East ‚Äì and co-author Art Moore expose just how deeply the submission, denial and deception run. Haney's insider, eyewitness account, supported by internal memos and documents, exposes a federal government capitulating to an enemy within and punishing those who reject its narrative.

Haney discloses:

How the Bush administration stripped him and other frontline officers of their ability to define the threat;
How much the Obama administration knew in advance of the Boston Marathon bombing and how it launched an ongoing cover-up on behalf of a major ally;
The administration‚Äôs stealth policy to protect Islamic leaders with supremacist beliefs and violent-jihadist ties, allowing them to freely travel between the U.S. and the Middle East;
The scope of access to the White House and the classified information the Obama administration gave to members of Muslim Brotherhood front groups;
The damning intelligence on Muslim Brotherhood-linked leaders invited to sit at the table and help form national-security policy;
The ""words matter"" memo imposing the demands of radical U.S. Muslims leaders on the DHS, including stripping intelligence and official communications of any mention of Islam in association with terrorism;
The purging of training material that casts Islam in a negative light;
The erasing and altering of vital intelligence on terrorists and terror threats;
The fear-based tactics imposed by the Muslim Brotherhood front groups in the U.S. and their accomplices that paralyze officials, members of Congress and any Department of Homeland Security employee who dares to expose or resist their agenda; and
Much more ‚Ä¶
In this well-documented, first-person account of his unique service with DHS, Haney shows why it's imperative that Americans demand that when they see something and say something, the servants under their charge do something to prevent a cunning, relentless enemy from carrying out its stated aim to ""destroy Western Civilization from within.""

1433,"On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Author David Paul Kuhn joined host Ben Domenech to discuss the makeup of the Democratic coalition of the ‚Äô70s and how it compares to the Democratic party of today.

Kuhn wrote about the subject in his most recent book ‚ÄúThe Hardhat Riot: Nixon, New York City, and the Dawn of the White Working-Class Revolution.‚Äù

Democrats don‚Äôt have to win a majority of the white working class, but they have to win enough of them, Kuhn asserted. Joe Biden is potentially in a position to do so in November. Once democrats lose the anti-Trump coalition, which is much larger than the typical democrat coalition, they will have a harder time winning a majority of seats in both houses. Kuhn said the democratic party ought to focus on gaining more white middle class votes.

‚ÄúAs Karl Rove said about Hispanics in 2004‚Ä¶ Republicans don‚Äôt have to win Hispanics, they just have to win enough of them. And what the Democrats have misunderstood for a quarter to a half-century is this need that they don‚Äôt need to win them [middle class white voters], they just need to win enough of them.‚Äù

08:36 Many Chinese Businessmen Say Their Bank Accounts Were Frozen by Police

----
After severe flooding in central and southern China ruined rice crops, many farmers have been left struggling.

Following heavy rainfall in the past half-month, some rice crops began to sprout, meaning they can no longer be harvested.

China‚Äôs National Meteorological Center warned that more rain is expected in central, southern, and southwestern China for the next couple of days, with some anticipated to be more severe.
----
On September 25, a report released by Chinese Global Television Network (CGTN) said that New Zealand and China will upgrade its free trade agreement (FTA) within the framework of the controversial Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
----
A woman and her husband have been trapped at home for 64 days after she attempted to travel to Beijing and call on authorities to address her grievances.

Ordinary Chinese citizens can petition the National Public Complaints and Proposals Administration in Beijing, an agency that hears public complaints. Such petitioning is a tradition that dates back to ancient China, when citizens would travel to the capital and plead with officials of the imperial court as a last resort to seek justice.
----
Many Chinese businessmen in foreign trade recently complained online that their bank accounts were frozen by police in other cities for unknown reasons. When they tried to unlock their accounts, they were asked to go through complicated procedures and they had to pay penalties. 
----
At this year's UN General Assembly, US President Donald Trump severely condemned the CCP and requested that ‚ÄúThe United Nations must hold China accountable for their actions.‚Äù Secretary of State Pompeo mentioned in other speeches that the CCP has severely penetrated local governments and other organizations in the United States. The first day of the high-level General Debate of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly was on September 22. President Trump delivered a speech in video. He talked about the CCP virus pandemic, clearly pointing out that the virus is sweeping the world because the CCP and the WHO misled people by spreading false information, so they must be held accountable.

1472,Brody File Exclusive Interview:¬†President Trump Relying On God Now More Than Ever,1,CBN News
1473,"‚ÄúHow many parents ‚Ä¶ send their children to school so central planners can mold them into functionally illiterate cogs in a centrally planned machine, having just enough knowledge to do their preassigned task? How will such cogs be able to think critically, much less sustain liberty and the American experiment? The short answer is that they will not ‚Äì and that is the point.‚Äù ‚Äì The Authors

Utopian dictators like Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot and Mao are criminals ‚Äì genocidal psychopaths who have killed more human beings in the last hundred years than any other ideologues in history. They don't limit their murder to individuals, but to entire nations.

In the United States another form of utopians, the ""progressives,"" have tried to destroy traditional America by strategically dumbing down her people. America's future is being crippled on purpose in order to fundamentally transform the nation, its values and its system of government. Laid out a century ago by progressive luminary John Dewey, the fruits of his schemes are plain to see today. Dewey got rid of the traditional intensive phonics method of instruction and imposed a ""look-say,"" ""sight"" or ""whole-word"" method that forces children to read English as if it were Chinese. The method is widely used in today's public schools, which is a major reason there are so many failing public schools that cannot teach children the basics. This can only be considered a blatant form of child abuse.

American author and veteran educator Samuel Blumenfeld and journalist Alex Newman have taken on the public education establishment as never before and exposed it for the de facto criminal enterprise it is.

""Crimes of the Educators"" reveals how the architects of America's public school disaster implemented a plan to socialize the United States by knowingly and willingly dumbing down the population, a mission now closer to success than ever as the Obama administration works relentlessly to nationalize K-12 schooling with Common Core.

The whole-word method of teaching children to read ‚Äì introduced by John Dewey and colleagues in the early 20th century and which permeates Common Core ‚Äì is a significant cause of dyslexia among students. Public education's war against religion, the ""great American math disaster,"" promotion of death education and the government's plan to lower standards for all so that ""no one is left behind"" are destroying the logic, reasoning and overall educational prowess of America's next generation.

According to the Program for International Student Assessment, which collects test results from 65 countries for its rankings:

In reading, students in 19 other locales scored higher than U.S. students
In science, 22 education systems scored above the U.S.
In mathematics, 29 nations and other jurisdictions outperformed the United States
Journalist Henry Mencken said it best in 1924 when he wrote that the aim of public education is ""to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and originality.""

It is time to hold the Department of Education accountable for the crimes of the educators.

About the Authors

Samuel L. Blumenfeld authored eight books on education, including: ""Is Public Education Necessary?"" ""NEA: Trojan Horse in American Education,"" ""The Whole Language/OBE Fraud"" and ""Homeschooling: A Parent's Guide to Teaching Children.""

Alex Newman is an international journalist, educator and consultant who is currently based in Europe but has lived on four continents. He has a degree in journalism from the University of Florida and has worked for numerous publications in the U.S. and abroad.

But first, she‚Äôd have to tell her parents. In this video, Kelly shares how that conversation went, what it was like carrying a baby to term as a teenager, and the process of placing that baby for adoption months later.

In 2014, 18,329 women in the U.S. chose to place their children for adoption. That same year, more than 900,000 women chose abortion. According to the National Council for Adoption, a nonpartisan group that advocates adoption, for every 1,000 abortions and births to unmarried women, there were only 6.9 adoptions.

Kelly‚Äôs story illuminates the beauty and hardships that so many young women undergo when faced with an unplanned pregnancy, and adds perspective to the pro-life battle that's being waged throughout the country.

""The best thing the Trump administration has done in my book are judges, especially the Supreme Court, and the second-best thing they've done is his foreign policy,"" Harsanyi said. 

Hemingway and Harsanyi also shared their thoughts on the upcoming election and the different outcomes that might stem from each scenario.

""I have prepared myself for the entire range of possibilities and I feel comfortable with all of those. I know what I need to do depending on what the outcomes are,"" Hemingway explained. ""I am wishing we could just get to the part where we find out what happens.""

The election, Harsanyi agreed, could swing either way.

""I can see anything,"" Harsanyi said. ""I could see Biden winning in a landslide, frankly, but  I could see it going the other way too so I don't know.""

""I think whoever wins Pennsylvania wins,"" he added.

1529,"Utopian dictators like Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot and Mao are criminals ‚Äì genocidal psychopaths who have killed more human beings in the last hundred years than any other ideologues in history. They don't limit their murder to individuals, but to entire nations.

In the United States another form of utopians, the ""progressives,"" have tried to destroy traditional America by strategically dumbing down her people. America's future is being crippled on purpose in order to fundamentally transform the nation, its values and its system of government. Laid out a century ago by progressive luminary John Dewey, the fruits of his schemes are plain to see today. Dewey got rid of the traditional intensive phonics method of instruction and imposed a ""look-say,"" ""sight"" or ""whole-word"" method that forces children to read English as if it were Chinese. The method is widely used in today's public schools, which is a major reason there are so many failing public schools that cannot teach children the basics. This can only be considered a blatant form of child abuse.

American author and veteran educator Samuel Blumenfeld and journalist Alex Newman have taken on the public education establishment as never before and exposed it for the de facto criminal enterprise it is.

""Crimes of the Educators"" reveals how the architects of America's public school disaster implemented a plan to socialize the United States by knowingly and willingly dumbing down the population, a mission now closer to success than ever as the Obama administration works relentlessly to nationalize K-12 schooling with Common Core.

The whole-word method of teaching children to read ‚Äì introduced by John Dewey and colleagues in the early 20th century and which permeates Common Core ‚Äì is a significant cause of dyslexia among students. Public education's war against religion, the ""great American math disaster,"" promotion of death education and the government's plan to lower standards for all so that ""no one is left behind"" are destroying the logic, reasoning and overall educational prowess of America's next generation.

According to the Program for International Student Assessment, which collects test results from 65 countries for its rankings:

In reading, students in 19 other locales scored higher than U.S. students
In science, 22 education systems scored above the U.S.
In mathematics, 29 nations and other jurisdictions outperformed the United States
Journalist Henry Mencken said it best in 1924 when he wrote that the aim of public education is ""to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and originality.""

It is time to hold the Department of Education accountable for the crimes of the educators.

1539,"Like its namesake, ""Scarlet Letters"" addresses the hard truths of life in an increasingly ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù America where the irrational prejudices of a group can crush the soul of the individual. In both the old and new Puritanism, worshippers achieve a sense of moral worth simply by designating themselves among ‚Äúthe elect‚Äù ‚Äì no good works required. To validate that uncertain status, they feel compelled to heap abuse upon the sinner lest they, too, be thought guilty of the sin. Rather than simply cataloguing the neo-Puritan assaults on reason and liberty, ""Scarlet Letters"" illustrates how the progressive movement came to mimic a religion in its structure but not at all in its spirit, while profiling those brave individuals who dared to take a stand against this inquisition.

In the neo-Puritan world, all conservatives are an awkwardly worded tweet away from being branded homophobes, racists, sexists, Islamophobes or worse. Progressives force assumptions upon anyone who disagrees with their political and social agenda. Those who dare suggest a violent attack was committed by someone of Islamic faith are Islamophobes. Those who identify the race of even a wanted criminal are racists. Those who don‚Äôt support gay marriage are homophobes with a capital ‚ÄúH.‚Äù In the eyes of the progressive neo-Puritan, that word ‚Äì that letter ‚Äì becomes all that a person is.

With real-life examples from ""sexist"" Clarence Thomas to ""Islamophobe"" Ayaan Hirsi Ali to ""racist"" Paula Deen to ""homophobe"" Phil Robertson, author Jack Cashill explains how a person‚Äôs identity is reduced to the cruelest of stereotypes. Falsified narratives and manufactured outrage perpetuate the neo-Puritan goals, whether they be affecting a presidential election or simply undermining an individual‚Äôs personal appeal in order to drag him down.

Discover how progressive forces have eroded traditional American values and how the movement became inquisitional and vengeful. Find out how individuals and organizations have found the courage to resist this movement ‚Äì and what you can do to successfully fight back.

Did Jesus of Nazareth really intend to start a brand new religion called ""Christianity""?

Or, did He come to fulfill that which all of the Hebrew prophets had foretold since the fall of man‚Äîsomething the Holy Scriptures mysteriously and wonderfully call ""the restitution of all things.""

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

Wuhan Optics Valley Pedestrian Street is considered a paradise for shopping, dining, and entertainment. Tourists visiting Wuhan often put it on their list of must-see attractions. 

On April 9, the day after the removal of city-wide lockdown, dozens of business owners held a protest in the shopping district, demanding one year‚Äôs free rent.

Protesters:
One year‚Äôs free rent, or we will stop the lease and quit. 

However, their landlord, a state-owned real estate company, refused to negotiate any form of rent reduction with them. 

A video released in early May showed that almost all shops and restaurants on the Pedestrian Street remain closed. 
-
Opened in November 2013, the Wuhan Optics Valley Pedestrian Street, which spans nearly one mile, is said to be the longest pedestrian-only street in the world. The area is composed of five blocks named after their respective architectural styles; Contemporary Charm, Spanish Charm, German Charm, Italian Charm, and French Charm.

With more than 1,000 shops, including themed restaurants, beauty salons, fitness clubs, and an entertainment city, the street used to attract visitors seeking a diverse shopping and dining experience.

1627,"Sue Ellen Browder, a former Cosmo writer for 20 years, wrote fake news before ‚Äúfake news‚Äù was ever a thing. Except she prefers not to call it that‚Äînot because she‚Äôs embarrassed to admit she wrote fake news (although she‚Äôs certainly not proud), but because she thinks the term ‚Äúfake news‚Äù is too vague to understand.
 
Instead, she prefers the term ""propaganda."" And decades later, she's coming clean about the lies she sold to help Cosmopolitan convince women that sexual liberation was the key to happiness and success.

Tragically, the readers of Cosmopolitan weren't the only ones to buy into the propaganda. At 27 years old, Browder was happily married with two children at home. When she became pregnant with a third, she and her husband got an abortion. It was 1974, the year after Roe v. Wade.

‚ÄúI did not realize what a traumatic experience that would be later in my life, how much that would haunt me.‚Äù
 
About 20 years later, in 1994, Browder‚Äôs last piece appeared in Cosmopolitan. Three decades after that, she converted to Catholicism and sought the help of the church to heal her from the abortion.
 
‚ÄúWhen you start betraying the truth, it will come back to haunt you,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt will get you in the end. And that's why even though I knew we were making up stories, I still got sucked in and thought abortion would be OK.‚Äù

In 2015, she published a book on her experience, ""Subverted: How I Helped the Sexual Revolution Hijack the Women‚Äôs Movement.""

In it, Browder says pro-life women must reclaim the feminist movement for themselves. In fact, she says, pro-life feminism is the ""authentic version"" of feminism.
 
But reclaiming feminism won‚Äôt be easy. It will require girls and young women to reject the ideas being sold to them in the pages of Cosmopolitan and almost everywhere else.

The U.S. government will remove Chinese apps such as TikTok and WeChat that present great threats in the U.S. in order to protect the privacy of American businesses and people and to minimize national security risks. Many countries have also followed the footsteps. After banning iQiYi in Taiwan, an online video platform based in Beijing, the Taiwanese government further announced a fine imposed on ‚ÄúTaobao Taiwan‚Äù and demanded it to withdraw its investment or make corrections within six months. Experts believe that Tencent may be the next target to be banned.

Following the recent shutdown of iQiyi, the Taiwanese government announced on August 24 that ""Taobao Taiwan"" has investment coming from mainland China. In addition to the fine, the company has a deadline of six months to withdraw its investment or make corrections. In October last year, Taobao Taiwan, a platform belonging to the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group, was officially launched in Taiwan and operates under a brand license to the branch of a British company in Taiwan, Claddagh Venture Investment Limited.

It is understood that the User Service Agreement and Privacy Policy of Taobao Taiwan clearly states that by agreeing to the Agreement, members in Taiwan authorize Alibaba Group to use their personal information and to transfer their transaction information to Alibaba‚Äôs server located in China. Such a requirement may pose a security risk to users in Taiwan.

Experts believe that mainland investors may circumvent investment audits to enter Taiwan in the future.

Sheng Xue, a Chinese-Canadian author, indicated that the CCP‚Äôs infiltration and aggression in the world is everywhere, especially through the method of economic trade. This has created a huge impact on the entire world. 

A netizen said that the Taiwanese government acted faster than the U.S. government. Another said that Taiwan did a great job. One also said that he has long stopped using Tencent and iQiYi because these are not representative of a free market environment and fair competition.

Recently, India blocked dozens of Chinese mobile apps, including TikTok, and also changed the rule by limiting Chinese investments in India. Bloomberg reported that India‚Äôs Ministry of External Affairs has been told that Chinese businessmen, scholars, industry experts, and advocacy groups will need prior clearance before being granted a visa.

08:06 Nokia Wins 5G Contract From Britain‚Äôs BT to Replace Huawei Kit
09:41 U.S. Report Lists CCP‚Äôs 11 Major Environmental Abuses
15:09 Dissidents in China 'Disappeared' for Many Years
‚Äî‚Äî
The U.S. Department of Commerce‚Äôs Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) issued a letter dated Sept. 25 to American companies asking them to acquire a government export license before they can sell certain technology to the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.(SMIC) and its subsidiaries. It is another US blow to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the chip sector after cutting off supplies to Huawei.
‚Äî‚Äî
China‚Äôs former finance minister Lou Jiwei warned in a recent speech that China‚Äôs ‚Äúimmature‚Äù 5G technology is likely to become a failed investment.

In recent weeks, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has emphasized the need for the country‚Äôs economy to develop an ‚Äúinternal circulation system‚Äîin other words, having domestic sectors produce all the goods for Chinese consumption, from raw materials to manufacturing.
‚Äî‚Äî
On September 29, the Finnish company, Nokia, announced that it has clinched a deal with Britain‚Äôs biggest mobile operator BT to supply 5G radio equipment in one of the first major wins under new CEO Pekka Lundmark.

The deal will make Nokia BT‚Äôs largest equipment provider and comes just months after Britain said it would ban China‚Äôs Huawei Technologies from next-generation 5G telecom networks.
‚Äî‚Äî
The U.S. State Department released a report last week, listing the CCP‚Äôs 11 major environmental abuses in recent years. Experts assert this report further demonstrates the illegitimacy of the Chinese Communist regime.
‚Äî‚Äî
Ruling under the CCP, the ""disappeared"" and ""dead"" have gradually become the norm in China. Dissidents, human rights lawyers, or anyone the CCP wants to suppress and control can all become victims. Today we will focus on a few people who have ""disappeared"" for many years. On August 1, 2018, when Shandong scholar Sun Wenguang was interviewed by the Voice of America (VOA), the CCP police broke into the house and forcibly arrested him. The incident shocked the world. On Aug 13th, Sun Wenguang, who was released home, complained to a VOA reporter.

In addition to the cartels, we are also bringing in Chinese subversion and espionage into our universities.

Campus Reform asked students for their thoughts on this order. Students widely voiced their approval of Biden‚Äôs order. But when they learned of the details contained in the order, some students were hesitant to support this decision. 

Students cited women potentially feeling ""uncomfortable"" with biological men being in their locker rooms. Students also spoke out against the sports aspect of the executive order, feeling it is unfair for women. 

But it's not just students who are voicing concerns about biological men competing against women.

Prior to Biden taking office, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) sponsored a bill in Congress to prevent biological males from competing in women's sports, as Campus Reform reported.

While I have been known to sing the song at every opportunity‚Äîin the shower, at karaoke, while washing my hands (the chorus is 20 seconds, you‚Äôre welcome)‚Äîmy dance skills are barely on par with someone in the back row of a high school musical chorus, and thus, I have never been able to master the iconic ‚ÄúOops...

Instead, I asked three of my bravest colleagues to give it a shot for the blog. Check out how they did in the video above. We might not have moves like Britney, but we will follow her lead anywhere.

1701,"‚ÄúMen...admit that what really irritates them about modern women is that they can't, or won't, give themselves completely to men,‚Äù Nora Johnson wrote in her 1959 Atlantic article, ""Sex and the College Girl."" ‚ÄúThis is undoubtedly true ‚Ä¶ And this, God knows, is a good thing.‚Äù

In the article, which is excerpted and animated in the video above, Johnson grappled with changing expectations about sex, romance, and gender roles as society began to afford women more opportunity in the workplace. A common fallout, Johnson argued, was that young women felt the need to ‚Äúsettle‚Äù by trading passionate romance for comfort and stability. College-age girls could only hope to avoid disappointment by managing their expectations and maintaining a certain romantic reticence. 

‚ÄúThere must always be something held in reserve,‚Äù Johnson writes, ‚Äúa part of her that she will give to no one, not even her husband. It is her belief in herself ‚Ä¶ It is the dream of the things she never did.‚Äù

1710,"On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Shadi Hamid joined host Ben Domenech to discuss what the past few months have revealed about our country and how they have shaped public opinion on our country‚Äôs leadership. Hamid is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a contributing writer at The Atlantic, and author of several books, including his most recent, ‚ÄúIslamic Exceptionalism.‚Äù

Hamid argued that the reaction by so-called experts concerning quarantine and the recent protests following the death of George Floyd have revealed how untrustworthy they are. Their constantly changing opinion during quarantine, Hamid said, has caused him to lose faith in those in powerful positions. He added the experts have further undermined their position by putting politics above themselves in regards to the protests.

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôve seen in the COVID period is that you can‚Äôt really trust experts all that much. As if we had to be reminded of that, we were,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have the best and the brightest, we have the great medical professionals, epidemiologists, so on and so forth. But they got quite a few things wrong and that led to a lot of what I saw as growing distrust toward elites.‚Äù

1731,"America‚Äôs Fastest-Growing Newspaper is Now Available on Any Device: üîµ  http://ept.ms/EpochNews
Two months of torrential rains have led to massive flooding across the Yangtze, Yellow, and Huai rivers. The Huai River is a major river located about midway between Yangtze and Yellow rivers, the two largest rivers in China. 

In Sichuan Province, 22 rivers have exceeded their flood warning levels. On Aug. 18, for the first time in history, local authorities issued a Level 1 flood alert, the highest level flood emergency response. 

Floods in Longnan City of Gansu Province in northwest China submerged 300 houses, and caused multiple mudslides.

Meanwhile, many places across China have experienced summer snows, from the southernmost province Hainan, to Beijing in the north, to Xinjiang in northwest. On Aug. 16, in the Qilian Mountain region of Qinghai Province, summer turned into winter in a blink of an eye when temperature suddenly dropped from 61¬∫F to 28¬∫F and snowflakes started to fall from the sky. Local meteorological staff pointed out it had never snowed in August in the past.

This is the seventh summer snow in China this year. 

In addition, typhoon Higos, the seventh this year, made landfall at around 6 a.m. on Aug. 20 in Zhuhai City of south China‚Äôs Guangdong Province, with a maximum wind force of 78 mph near its eye, according to China‚Äôs National Meteorological Center.

------------------
On March 25, the lockdown was lifted from most areas of Hubei province, except Wuhan. Hubei residents with a ‚Äògreen‚Äô health code were permitted to resume travel. However, due to distrust between Jiangxi and Hubei provinces, Jiangxi police established a checkpoint at the Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge on the morning of March 27 and refused entry to Hubei residents. This triggered a clash between police of both provinces, and up to ten thousand people gathered to protest.

A large number of Hubei residents gathered on the bridge, shouting, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go Hubei!‚Äù Other Hubei residents held up banners asking Jiangxi police, ‚ÄúWhy are you coming to Hubei and setting up a blockade?‚Äù Protesters overturned multiple Jiujiang police vehicles. Others went to the Jiangxi Jiujiang Bridge Police Station, shouting, ‚ÄúApologize Jiujiang!‚Äù That evening, Huanggang city in Hubei province sent two special forces vans and multiple police vehicles to the scene as a demonstration of force.

Xiaochi town and Jiujiang city are separated by a river. It‚Äôs only a 10 minute ride from Xiaochi to Jiujiang Railway Station. Hubei residents have been under lockdown for over two months and have no income. Many have mortgages and car loans to pay and are desperate to go out to find work. Jiangxi‚Äôs blockade angered many people, leading to a large scale protest.

Xiaochi residents say that because authorities have concealed the truth about the epidemic in Hubei from the start, they are suspicious about the recent drop in the number of confirmed cases. They suspect the drop may be due to a need for people to go back to work. Therefore, they are ostracizing Hubei residents. 
Ms. Li, a Xiaochi town resident said, 

‚ÄúThe bridge is currently open. Today, they started allowing people without certification as long as they had a green code. We can‚Äôt do anything about others not believing us.‚Äù  

Mr. Li, a Jiujiang city resident said, 

‚ÄúThe bridge is under the jurisdiction of Jiujiang. For example, the maintenance of the bridge and the collection of tolls, including police patrols, all of that is done by the city of Jiujiang. In other words, when such a thing happens at the border of Hubei province, the Jiujiang police should have jurisdiction over that area. Now, both sides are arguing with valid points. Half the people in Jiujiang are people from Hubei. There are many reasons for the conflict that happened yesterday, but not letting Hubei people come over? I am afraid I have to disagree with that.‚Äù

According to the independent financial analysis Chinese program ‚ÄúCold Eyes on Politics,‚Äù Beijing took the lead in preventing Hubei residents from entering and other provinces simply followed suit. The fact that Hubei is being discriminated against despite the lockdown being lifted shows that other provinces are aware of how serious the situation is in Hubei. If Hubei residents cross province borders, they can potentially cause outbreaks in Jiangxi. At that time, Hubei may be able to push the blame, but Jiangxi would be held accountable.",1,The Epoch Times

Auditioning for the show is either a three-day affair or the journey of a lifetime, according to the girls, but much like life, everyone‚Äôs path is different! ‚ÄúThe audition process was probably the most painstaking, exhausting thing other than preparing for the actual show itself,‚Äù says Brita Filter. ‚ÄúI had all of New York City holding my goddamn phone trying to record me.‚Äù Ma‚Äôam, respectfully, we appreciate the effort!

The Chinese-language Epoch Times obtained an internal document from the Municipal Government of Jining, Shandong Province, which revealed that the director of a local crematorium wrote to the municipal government, complaining that when COVID-19 patients died, local hospitals did not specify whether they are COVID-19 deaths, posing a huge risk to crematorium employees who handle these corpses. 

The Shandong Health Commission announced on Feb. 20, 2020 that seven prison guards and 200 inmates in the city‚Äôs Rencheng Prison were found to have been infected with the COVID-19 virus. In fact, an insider revealed to the Epoch Times that the first group of prison guards infected were confirmed on Feb. 10.

Jining is not a big city and is far away from Hubei Province, the epicenter of COVID-19 outbreak. However, the number of COVID-19 infections in Jining is among the highest for a city of its size due to the outbreak within Rencheng prison. 

The Chinese-language Epoch Times reached the director of a crematorium in Jining on Feb. 29, 2020.

1856,"Over the course of the 20th century, black Americans have lost approximately 12 million acres of land. This mass land dispossession‚Äîa war waged by deed of title, which has affected 98 percent of black farmers‚Äîcan only be called theft, says Atlantic writer Vann R. Newkirk II in a new documentary.

The Scott family, from Mound Bayou, Mississippi, can trace their land ownership back to 1938, when the family‚Äôs agriculturally gifted patriarch began amassing more than 1,000 acres. By the late ‚Äò80s, the Scotts had all but lost their land entirely. What happened in those intervening years is a complex story of systematic discrimination that‚Äôs emblematic of the experience of many black families in America.

‚ÄúIf you look at the Scotts, what the land meant to them wasn't just money,‚Äù Newkirk says in the film. ‚ÄúIt was destiny. It was something to hold onto. It was a purpose and something that held their family together through generations.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Robach: ‚ÄúNow it's All Coming Out ‚Ä¶ I Freaking Had All Of It‚Ä¶‚Äù

(New York, NY) Newly revealed footage leaked by an ABC insider has exposed how network executives rejected allegations against Jeffrey Epstein years ago, even though there was content regarding the merit of those claims in-hand.

Amy Robach, ‚ÄòGood Morning America‚Äô Co-Host and Breaking News Anchor at ABC, explains how a witness came forward years ago with information pertaining to Epstein, but Disney-owned ABC News refused to air the material for years. Robach vents her anger in a ‚Äúhot mic‚Äù moment with an off-camera producer, explaining that ABC quashed the story in it‚Äôs early stages.  ‚ÄúI've had this interview with Virginia Roberts (Now Virginia Guiffre) [alleged Epstein victim]. We would not put it on the air. Um, first of all, I was told ‚ÄúWho's Jeffrey Epstein.  No one knows who that is.  This is a stupid story.‚Äù 

She continues, ‚ÄúThe Palace found out that we had her whole allegations about Prince Andrew and threatened us a million different ways.‚Äù

Robach goes on to express she believes that Epstein was killed in prison saying, ‚ÄúSo do I think he was killed? 100% Yes, I do‚Ä¶He made his whole living blackmailing people... Yup, there were a lot of men in those planes. A lot of men who visited that Island, a lot of powerful men who came into that apartment.‚Äù  

Robach repeats a prophetic statement purportedly made by Attorney Brad Edwards ‚Äú‚Ä¶[T]here will come a day when we will realize Jeffrey Epstein was the most prolific pedophile this country has ever known,‚Äù and Disgustedly Robach states ‚ÄúI had it all three years ago.‚Äù

Richardson‚Äôs revelations will stun readers who are unaware of the similarities between the Antichrist and Islam‚Äôs expectations about a returning Jesus. His explanation of the relationship between Christian end-time prophecy and Islamic expectations of world domination has shocked readers and revolutionized eschatological expectations for a generation. The Islamic Antichrist is the book to read for insights on the world's fastest-growing religion and the future of the world.

1895,"An area home to some of the earliest civilizations, Iraq became a battleground for competing forces after the US-led ousting of President Saddam Hussein in 2003. The country remains volatile and the lives of innocent people have been victim to brutality.

Since then, approximately one million Assyrian Christians have been forced to become refugees inside and outside of Iraq.In the summer of 2014 ISIS terrorists broke through the borders of Iraq and have forced the Iraqi and Kurdish military to seek help from world powers in defending their country.

Persecution through Religious and Ethnic Cleansing
 
Assyrian Christians in Iraq have been forced to greatly compromise their freedom. Since 2003, orders to either convert to Islam, pay a protection tax, exit Iraq without their personal belongings, or be killed have been in place.
There is ample proof that exists to ensure this threat is real. Countless Christians have been crucified and thousands of parents have buried their children following brutal and vicious murders. Families have been ripped apart and suffered immeasurable atrocities at the hands of ISIS.

Assyrian Christians have specifically been targets of this cruelty. Since 2008, many priests and church deacons have been kidnapped, beheaded, and assassinated with their body parts scattered among their churches. Ancient Christian churches and monasteries have been continuously bombed and many churches have been converted into mosques.

The journey to fight evil will be difficult and long, but we ask for your help now more than ever. Learn about how the programs you can support help Christians in Iraq.",1,WorldNetDaily

He lies in cryopreservation at the Cryonics Institute in Michigan‚Äîwhich he founded‚Äîalongside his late mother, his first and second wives, and 150 other deceased. 

Ettinger, known as the ‚Äúfather of cryonics,‚Äù popularized the idea in his 1962 book The Prospect of Immortality. (Isaac Asimov, the renowned biochemist and science-fiction writer, helped Ettinger publish the book.) Cryonicists believe that technology will sufficiently advance to a point where cells can be rejuvenated and the aging process reversed. In practice, legally deceased patients arrive at a cryonics facility packed in ice. Cryonicists interrupt the dying process by draining the blood from the body and perfusing the corpse with a mixture of anti-freeze and organ-preserving chemicals, known as cryoprotective agents. The body is then transformed into a vitrified state and lowered into a below-freezing chamber filled with liquid nitrogen, where it lies in wait for a future generation to restore it.

1972,"On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Senior Editor Mollie Hemingway and Federalist Co-Founder Sean Davis discuss topics concerning American culture, specifically analyzing the mainstream media‚Äôs involvement in the recent defacement of historical monuments and handling of President Trump‚Äôs Fourth of July speech at Mount Rushmore.

‚ÄúI feel like we‚Äôve been conditioned to a whole bunch of media lies, whether it was the Russia hoax, or pretty much anything, the coronavirus, the protests, and the riots. They‚Äôve lied about anything,‚Äù Davis said. ‚ÄúAnd now when they do it and they take it to the level they did after that speech. I‚Äôm not sure they even watched it. It was such a coordinated response across the left.‚Äù

Davis said the mainstream media has proven they will take anything that is good news for the country, because it is also a positive reflection on the president, and distort or ignore the story.

The statue destruction, Hemingway said, which began as a movement led by rioters about removing Confederate statues, was quickly compounded by the mainstream media‚Äôs defense of toppling prominent American figures such as the Founding Fathers.

Larry David Reacts to Jennifer Lawrence‚Äôs Crush on Him ‚Äì The New Yorker Festival

1989,,1,Breitbart News
1990,"As much of the world now sees the United States with disdain and distrust, it is time for us to take a cold, hard look at what we have become. John Adams said, ‚ÄúOur Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.‚Äù We have strayed from our clear moral beginnings to become an egotistical culture that glorifies self. We try to set our own standards despite Thomas Paine‚Äôs warning that ‚Äúman cannot make or invent or contrive principles. He can only discover them, and he ought to look through the discovery to the Author.‚Äù

As our society celebrates injustice against people who stand for their convictions, it‚Äôs hard to forget the words of John Adams who wrote, ‚Äújustice is a great Christian as well as moral duty.‚Äù With the decline of virtue in so many areas of our culture ‚Äì from twerking on stage to cheating scandals at universities to corporate theft by aggressive bankers ‚Äì we should take heed of George Washington‚Äôs warning that ‚Äúliberty, when it degenerates into licentiousness, begets confusion, and frequently ends in tyranny or some woeful catastrophe.‚Äù

""Liberty‚Äôs Secrets"" exposes readers to the Founding Fathers as never before. They believed in God, Judeo-Christian values and the freedom and necessity of religion in order to have a free and prosperous society. They believed in a free press and knew, as John Adams argued, that ‚Äúwhen a people is corrupted, the press may be made an engine to complete their ruin.‚Äù They believed in a limited government, strong education and private property.

""Liberty‚Äôs Secrets"" is like having a front-row seat to the congresses and conventions where these leaders hashed out the profound issues of life and society. Charles has cataloged all of the Founding Fathers' writings, and ""Liberty‚Äôs Secrets"" provides an expos√© of their profound yet glossed-over insights, delving into the subjects most important to maintaining a free society at a time when we most need to recover them. In so doing, ""Liberty‚Äôs Secrets"" equips readers to use the Founders' knowledge and understanding to neutralize the cultural myths currently undermining American liberty.

It is hard not to wonder whether catastrophe is upon us. If ever there was a time to grow up as a nation, now is the time. It is time to recover the morals and moorings of our Founders. It is time to rediscover ""Liberty‚Äôs Secrets.""

Charl van Wyk, author of Shooting Back, talks to WND TV about the threat of ISIS to South Africa.

What would you do if armed terrorists broke into your church and starting attacking your friends with automatic weapons in the middle of a worship service?

Would you be prepared to defend yourself and other innocents?

Would you be justified in doing so?

Is it time for Americans to consider such once-unthinkable possibilities?

There is one man in the world who can address these questions with firsthand experience.

His name is Charl Van Wyk ‚Äì a South African who was faced with just such a shocking scenario.

In ""Shooting Back: The Right and Duty of Self-Defense,"" Van Wyk makes a biblical, Christian case for individuals arming themselves with guns, and does so more persuasively than perhaps any other author because he found himself in a church attacked by terrorists.

2043,"Have you ever eaten wasabi?

If you answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù to that question, you are likely mistaken. Most sushi eaters‚Äîeven in Japan‚Äîare actually being served a mixture of ground horseradish and green food coloring splashed with a hint of Chinese mustard. Worldwide, experts believe that this imposter combination masquerades as wasabi about 99% of the time.

The reason boils down to supply and demand. Authentic wasabi, known as Wasabia japonica, is the most expensive crop to grow in the world. The temperamental semiaquatic herb, native to the mountain streams of central Japan, is notoriously difficult to cultivate. Once planted, it takes several years to harvest; even then, it doesn‚Äôt germinate unless conditions are perfect. Grated wasabi root loses its flavor within 15 minutes.

The Japanese have grown wasabi for more than four centuries. 75-year old Shigeo Iida, the eighth-generation owner of his family‚Äôs wasabi farm in Japan, takes pride in his tradition, which is profiled in Edwin Lee‚Äôs short documentary ""Wasabia Japonica,"" co-produced by Japan Curator. ‚ÄúReal wasabi, like the ones we grow, has a unique, fragrant taste that first hits the nose,‚Äù Iida says in the film. ‚ÄúThe sweetness comes next, followed finally by spiciness.‚Äù Read more: https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/585172/wasabi-fake/

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke at an Atlantic Council Front Page event on Sept. 15, pointing out that in recent months, China‚Äôs ‚Äúpredatory economic activity,‚Äù coupled with its sneaky handling of the coronavirus pandemic, has ‚Äúawakened‚Äù the world to the threat Beijing poses to the international community. 

The Atlantic Council invited Pompeo to one of its virtual meetings on Tuesday to discuss his recent trip to Europe and how European nations are awakening to the China challenge. 

Pompeo said that the United States needs to recognize that its China policies chosen in the 1970s must be changed to protect the security of American people.

Pompeo reiterated that ‚ÄúAmerica is a deeply moral nation and it has a set of founding principles upon which that morality is based.‚Äù China using ‚Äúhuman rights language to cover up for the most unbelievable human rights violations‚Äù is ‚Äúan enormous crisis in human rights in the 21st century.‚Äù
----
While the CCP virus was raging in Wuhan, another virus was also quietly spreading in Lanzhou, China due to man-made accidents. After issuing an official statement which touched on the issue lightly at the end of last year, relevant data was never released. However, mainland media disclosed on September 14 that the number of infected people exceeded the official data by more than ten times. Almost one year has passed and many infected people still cannot confirm whether they got sick, what treatment to take, and what to do in the future.
----
A new report has found that each year, Beijing pours billions of dollars to fund its influence operations worldwide, which seeks to silence dissidents, suppress minority groups, and acquire foreign technology.

Chinese diplomats have insisted that united front groups‚Äîstate-affiliated organizations in charge of spreading Beijing‚Äôs agenda at home and abroad‚Äîare benign bureaucratic missions facilitating foreign exchange based on ‚Äúopenness, transparency, [and] equality.‚Äù These groups are overseen by either the United Front Work Department or Chinese government agencies that are ultimately controlled by the department.

But the scale of such operations‚Äô funding appears to contradict Chinese authorities‚Äô claims.
----
There have been numerous unusual natural phenomena taking place in China this year, such as summer snows, coronavirus-shaped hailstones, mountains making strange sounds, and hundreds of fish leaping out of the water at the same time.

Netizens in the Xinjiang region and Shaanxi Province recently reported that some fruit trees that produce beautiful spring blossoms are now blooming in September. 

According to traditional Chinese culture, snow and hail in the wrong season, as well as flowers blooming in the wrong season, are inauspicious signs that foreshadow a big disaster in the coming months. 

Seven months ago, unusual sightings of dense flocks of crows were reported in central China‚Äôs Hubei Province, the place where the CCP virus originated, in late January and early February, when the outbreak was most serious. Chinese elderly used to say that crows are carrion-eaters and have the ability to anticipate death because they can smell the odor of those who are dying. Therefore, they hover around corpses or patients before death.

2047,"The Epoch Times is quickly becoming a household name across America. Learn about our history and why 'Truth and Tradition' is our motto.
Subscribe to The Epoch Times newspaper today: Visit https://www.ReadEpoch.com/ or call 917-905-2080

Inside the video: 
People are talking about The Epoch Times... ‚ÄúFactual. Honest news. Not biased. Completely straight-forward. Not emotionally going up and down. Bringing morality back to newspapers. Honest, old-fashioned journalism. You‚Äôre presenting the facts, and letting the reader decide.‚Äù 

The Epoch Times is a fearlessly independent news media that publishes in 35 countries and 21 languages. 

Truth and Tradition is our motto. Founded as an antidote to communist propaganda, today we‚Äôre quickly becoming a household name across America. 

Our subscribers thank us for our relentless and unbiased coverage. 

Jasper Fakkert, our editor-in-chief says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been a part of The Epoch Times for nearly a decade because I‚Äôve seen there‚Äôs no other major media outlet in the world as devoted to real journalism. The Epoch Times has never had any corporate or political agenda. We only serve our readers, and we‚Äôll stay that way, no matter what.‚Äù

 We connected the dots around Spygate, the Obama administration‚Äôs elaborate efforts against Trump‚Äôs 2016 campaign.

We often break news months ahead of other media on topics such as Chinese espionage, cyberwarfare, subversion in America, and more.

But our authoritative reporting didn‚Äôt only just begin. We are tried and true.
 
""Our paper was born out of the need to respond to a human rights catastrophe in China,‚Äù says Stephen Gregory, our publisher. ""It was enabled by the Communist Party‚Äôs vicious and dishonest propaganda. We soon learned that Western media were picking up and amplifying the lies. The Epoch Times' truthful reporting exposed the Communist Party‚Äôs lies for the Chinese people, but it also helped protect our Western audience. It disabused for them the lies in this propaganda. Our reporting has also helped uncover how communist ideas are taking root in our own country. The Epoch Times started as a small and unknown publication in one of the toughest media markets in the world. We have built it through hard work and trial and error.

We were founded in the year 2000 in Atlanta, Georgia by Chinese-Americans who had fled communist China.

Our independent reporting came at a price. Our staff members in China were jailed and tortured for their reporting, some for as long as 10 years.

Because our founders believed in truthfulness, compassion and tolerance, the principles of the spiritual practice Falun Gong, they felt such sacrifices were worth it to ensure for the world an independent, honest media, one that would report on the most pressing issues of our time. 

As many major media are losing people‚Äôs trust and declining further every day, the fastest-growing newspaper in America delivers truth and tradition.

2100,"The American Conservative‚Äôs 5th Annual Crony Capitalism Conference

The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was created to be a lifeline to small businesses struggling to stay afloat as the response to COVID-19 severely restricted their operations and decimated their bottom lines. But funding was quickly distributed to publicly traded companies, including established franchises, while mom and pop operations struggled to get access. Big and small banks alike allocated the lion‚Äôs share of monies to their relationship customers first, demonstrating once again that, even in a pandemic, the well-connected always end up at the front of the line.

COVID-19 measures made other parts of the playing field uneven, too, as business operating guidelines gave more latitude to the restaurants and retailers frequented by the elite than to neighborhood diners and corner stores.

What role did government and industry cronyism play in shaping our COVID economy? And how do we make sure all businesses, big and small, are treated fairly in a society still under the corona sun?

He shows how the facts are on our side, but Republicans are too scared to provide a counter-narrative on how allowing concealed carry and getting rid of soft targets for evildoers is the only way to either deter them or at least mitigate casualties.

The people who are conservative in their views but aren‚Äôt beholden to any party‚Äôs talking points. The independent thinkers who rely on things like the facts, context, and perspective to inform their ideology. The people who, although they form the backbone of this country, have been cast aside by the politicians and the media.

2137,"Wednesday, November 25, 2020: At the request of Senator Doug Mastriano (R-Adams/Cumberland/Franklin/York), the Senate Majority Policy Committee is holding a public hearing Wednesday to discuss 2020 election issues and irregularities. The hearing will feature former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

WHO: Senate Majority Policy Committee Chair David Argall (R-Berks/Schuylkill); Senate Majority Leader-Elect Kim Ward (R-39); State Rep. Dan Moul (R-91); State Rep. Rob Kauffman (R-89); and State Rep Paul Schemel (R-90); among other lawmakers will join Senator Mastriano in this historic hearing.

Mastriano is clear what is at risk.

‚ÄúElections are a fundamental principle of our democracy ‚Äì unfortunately, Pennsylvanians have lost faith in the electoral system,‚Äù said Mastriano, who recently called for the resignation of State Department Secretary Kathy Boockvar for negligence and incompetence. ‚ÄúIt is unacceptable.‚Äù

‚ÄúOver the past few weeks, I have heard from thousands of Pennsylvanians regarding issues experienced at the polls, irregularities with the mail-in voting system and concerns whether their vote was counted,‚Äù said Mastriano. ‚ÄúWe need to correct these issues to restore faith in our republic.‚Äù

WHERE: Wyndham Gettysburg, 95 Presidential Circle, Gettysburg, PA  17325. 

The hearing will be streamed live on policy.pasenategop.com.

WHEN: Wednesday, November 25th at 12:30 pm.

‚ÄúWe want assurance that the issues encountered during this past election don‚Äôt happen again,‚Äù said Chairman Argall. ‚ÄúSenator Mastriano requested this meeting because Pennsylvanians deserve a fair election.‚Äù

On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Assistant Editor Kylee Zempel joins Culture Editor Emily Jashinsky to discuss the passing of Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, President Trump's decision to nominate a woman justice as her replacement, and the media and Left's handling of the difficult confirmation battle that lies ahead.

""This was already an election cycle that included a pandemic. That included a recession that included historic widespread racial unrest and violence in our nation's cities and on our streets, and of course you layer all of that on top of the already existing craziness of the Trump presidency. And you have where we are right now. On this day, facing a confirmation battle in the election season of Donald Trump's first term,"" Jashinsky noted.

During the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the left and the media spun the narrative against Kavanaugh and Republicans. Pending President Trump's third nomination to the Court, however,  Zempel believes nothing has changed.

""The Democrats in the media just continue to show that they have no limiting principle,"" Zempel explained. ""They continue to show that they're willing to stretch the truth and smear figures at all costs.""

""It's not just Supreme Court nominations where the media just continue to demonstrate their malfeasance. I don't think that they've learned their lesson,"" she added.

2216,"Use PROMO code MuslimMafia50 and you'll receive 50% off your purchase when you order Muslim Mafia from the WND Superstore: http://superstore.wnd.com/search?keywords=Muslim%20Mafia

With ISIS metastasizing into more than two dozen countries, a massive refugee crisis threatening to negatively impact America much the same way it has decimated Europe, and increasing numbers of homegrown terrorists, radicalized into embracing jihad, within our own borders, Muslim Mafia is the book you need in order to understand what is really happening to America.

Muslim Mafia is the sensational result of a six-month undercover penetration of the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations that resulted in the collection of thousands of pages of smoking-gun documents from this terror-linked front group for the dangerous, mob-like Muslim Brotherhood.

Muslim Mafia delivers all the elements of a top-flight mystery novel, except that the situations and conversations are totally real. The book's frightening allegations are supported by more than 12,000 pages of confidential CAIR documents and hundreds of hours of video captured in an unprecedented undercover operation. This trail of information reveals the seditious and well-funded efforts of the Brotherhood under the nonprofit guise of CAIR to support the international jihad movement against the United States. Posing as an intern, Chris Gaubatz courageously gains the trust of CAIR's inner sanctum, working undercover while posing as a devoted convert to Islam, and blows the whistle on the entire factory fueling the wave of homegrown terrorism now plaguing America.

In the early morning of August 18, heavy floods submerged places such as Xiaoguzen and Tieluxiang in Qianwei County, Leshan City, Sichuan Province. Many villages located along the Min River were all covered in water, causing great losses. The flood even swept away some villagers who were sleeping, and some drowned. In Bayi Village, Xiaoguzen, a total of 14 families were swept away and houses collapsed. Villagers criticized the discharge of water upstream without any warning.

A video posted by netizens showed that after the floods, the situation in Bayi Village, Xiaoguzen, was in a mess, with rubbles and mud. The person who filmed the video said that 14 families in the village were all gone and their houses could not even be found. Xiaogu Middle School was also destroyed by the flood.

However, the official data claimed that from August 10 to 18, there were only 14 people who died and went missing after two rounds of heavy torrential rain hit Sichuan. Villagers from Bayi Village, Xiaoguzen, indicated that the local government concealed the actual death tolls and that he knew other people, including a person from another province, who drowned in a basement.

It‚Äôs been two months since the heavy floods covered many places in China. Recently, Sichuan Province experienced a great disaster. Since August 17, the highest level of flood emergency response has been activated for the first time in Sichuan‚Äôs history. Many rivers in the province had water levels rise rapidly. On August 18, Leshan City and other parts of the city experienced a once-in-a-century flood. On August 21, a landslide occurred in Hanyuan County, Ya‚Äôan City, Sichuan Province, burying about ten families. The local villagers filmed a video showing a hospital in the village covered in a mudslide. It is very possible that people were buried inside.

A special federal vaccine court has paid out billions for injuries from brain damage to death. But not for the form of brain injury we call autism. Now‚Äîwe have remarkable new information: a respected pro-vaccine medical expert used by the federal government to debunk the vaccine-autism link, says vaccines can cause autism after all.

2259,"On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission Brendan Carr joined host Ben Domenech to discuss Google's recent attempt to censor The Federalist and potential reform to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, under which big tech companies operate.

Carr favors Section 230 Reform after seeing the lack of accountability regarding recent events. Google's actions, he argued, go beyond their right to free speech and demand public accountability to their public representation. While some think that big tech companies have a right to do what they want as a private company, Carr explains that Section 230 actually gives them advantages over other types of companies.

""Section 230 is about a unique regulatory legal advantage for one set of political actors,"" he said. ""So libertarians that want to defend an efficient operation of the system are actually defending a unique legal privilege that's a one-off for these systems.""

ABOUT:
The First exists for the massive group of Americans whose voices have been ignored. The people who are passionate about American values, aren‚Äôt afraid to engage big ideas, and who care about where the country is headed. The people who are conservative in their views but aren‚Äôt beholden to any party‚Äôs talking points. The independent thinkers who rely on things like the facts, context, and perspective to inform their ideology. The people who, although they form the backbone of this country, have been cast aside by the politicians and the media.

The people whose beliefs and values are increasingly being cancelled. They are why we created The First. You are why we created The First.

2264,"‚ÄúMalcolm X, his legacy, is this idea that blackness is a positive, complex, richly glorious tradition to be a part of. That it was a responsibility and not a burden....Malcolm is the activist who allowed us to love ourselves. And that means black women. That means black men. That means black children. That means black babies. Because Malcolm said that self-love had to come from within.‚Äù ‚Äî Peniel E. Joseph, Ph.D.

Who was Malcolm X?

Fifty-five years after his assassination, the question looms.

History has told us that Malcolm X was the anti-MLK. A brilliant man full of rage (and quips), he openly referred to white people as the devil. The existing one-dimensional myth of Malcolm X was configured by the mainstream media and punctuated with notes of racism and Islamophobia. As we are well aware that the history of black people in the United States is often misrepresented‚Äîit‚Äôs no surprise that narratives about Malcolm X (one of the most iconic civil rights leaders) are a bit, well, hollow.

2265,"What is the life story of Jonathan Cahn, known as ""The Harbinger Man"" and a Messianic Rabbi? How did Cahn rise from relative obscurity to worldwide prominence and acclaim? Raised a Reform Jew, and hardened as an atheist, why did Cahn beg God to reveal Himself by laying Cahn near death's door? Was it Cahn's wake up call to surrender to Christ? But why? For what purposes?

Now, for the first time ever in the biographical documentary, The Harbinger Man: The Jonathan Cahn Story, Rabbi Cahn reveals (in his own words) his journey from being God's enemy to becoming a close confidante.

The one-hour documentary shares the African-American experience during the Revolutionary War and the rarely told stories of these overlooked heroes who helped establish this country.

‚ÄúA lot of people are uncomfortable with acknowledging that blacks have a stake in our country and have contributed and deserve better treatment,‚Äù Abdul-Jabbar goes on to say, ‚ÄúThe Revolutionary War period is important because it is the emergence of America.

You can vacation at a ""treesort,"" or watch a reality show about treetop architecture, or even rent a room in a treehouse on Airbnb.

In this short documentary, we interview people who build, live in, and love treehouses. These are far from the forts of childhood memory, though. They employ artificial limbs for support, boast both plumbing and running water, and wouldn't look out of place in luxury lifestyle magazines.  ""Treehouses are becoming more and more adult,"" says Michael Garnier, a treehouse building pioneer. ""They're not just for kids anymore.""

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas
2274,"‚ÄúIn our home, I take on a lot of responsibilities that previous generations would have scoffed at,‚Äù says Whit Honea, a co-founder of Dads 4 Change. In a new episode of Home School, The Atlantic‚Äôs animated series about parenting, Honea explains why, in a culture where outdated gender stereotypes are ‚Äúvery much alive,‚Äù parents shouldn‚Äôt dictate gender roles to their children. 

‚ÄúBy no means do I want to imply that it's wrong for kids to embrace things that they enjoy just because it falls on one [gender] or the other‚Äîjust that it shouldn't be mandated by us,‚Äù Honea says.

2282,"Today, we celebrate the death of one of the worst mass murderers of our time: the leader of ISIS. I explain why Trump struck the right moral and strategic tone in the way he depicted Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi‚Äôs death. He perfectly explained our vision of strike and maneuver vs. hold and build in the Middle East.¬† Unfortunately, the elites attacking him are all in with a moral dissonance that is dividing this country.¬†¬†¬†¬†

But there is bad news. Where ISIS really hurts us is through immigration mixed with civilization jihad on our own soil. I go through a recent court case on students being forced to write the Muslim conversion prayer in a public school and how the courts are hypocritical beyond belief when it comes to religion in the public square. Voluntary expression of Christianity has been banished from the public square, while coerced expression of Islam is greenlighted. Sadly, that is the way Baghdadi is getting the last laugh on us.

Man 1: Come on, give us lightning.
Man 1: Where are you? I can‚Äôt even see you. (laugh)

3:50 p.m., heavy rain and the day is as dark as night in Beijing.
Woman says: What time is it now? 3:50 p.m. Wow! The lightning.

Man1: Right at this time, look at Beijing, what is it now? Look at the sky, wow, it‚Äôs so dark. It‚Äôs really scary. Heavy rain is coming for sure.

Man 2: It is May 21, just past 3 p.m. in Beijing. It‚Äôs already dark as night. Isn‚Äôt this bizarre? It‚Äôs only 3 o‚Äôclock and the sky has already turned dark.

Man 3: May 21, 2020, 4 p.m. See how dark it is. 

Woman: It‚Äôs dark already. Can‚Äôt see anything now.

May 21, Beijing. Heavy rains.
Woman: It‚Äôs rainy. I didn‚Äôt bring my umbrella. Can‚Äôt leave now.

In the afternoon of May 21, hail struck Beijing.

A netizen commented, ‚ÄúEven heaven says this is the darkest tyranny in human history.‚Äù

Another netizen commented, ‚ÄúHeaven extinguishes the Chinese Communist Party.‚Äù

There‚Äôs also a netizen who made a comparison to the day on May 20 when Taiwanese president Tsai was sworn in for a second term, ‚ÄúOn the day President Tsai Ing-wen was inaugurated, a typhoon that was about to land had disappeared, and even the rainy season had stopped.
Like magic! It didn‚Äôt rain in Taipei!
Today, there are two meetings in Beijing.
Beijing should display typical fine spring weather at this time of year.
Instead, it was dark as the night, and hail attacks‚Ä¶

----
Internal documents obtained by The Epoch Times reveal that in the wave of the global industrial chain moving out of China, Chinese authorities issued an urgent order to ‚Äúkeep Japanese and South Korean companies from leaving China,‚Äù for both economic reasons and the CCP‚Äôs political agenda.

An internal letter from Huizhou Municipal Bureau of Commerce to the city‚Äôs Foreign Affairs Bureau on Aug. 10, 2020 indicated that over the years a total of 280 Korean-funded companies had set up plants in Huizhou, however, ‚Äúaffected by U.S.-China trade war, the coronavirus pandemic, and the withdrawal of Samsung Electronics from Huizhou, along with many other factors‚Äù Huizhou‚Äôs import and export trades with South Korean fell by 77.4 percent, of which exports plummeted 89.5 percent compared with last year.

According to statistics from the Huizhou Municipal Bureau of Commerce, there were 96 Korean companies in the city as of July 2020. That is to say, two thirds of Korean companies have either gone bankrupt or left China. 

The official letter from the city‚Äôs Foreign Affairs Office, which was marked ‚Äúextra-urgent‚Äù, showed that the CCP is becoming desperate.
----
Chinese communist regime has forcibly introduced a new education policy in Inner Mongolia, requiring Mandarin-language teaching from first grade and completely removing Mongolian-language teaching and Mongolian textbooks in two years.  The new policy has triggered intense protests among the ethnic Mongols. 

In the name of ""alternative bilingual education"", the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) began to promote Mandarin-only education at schools in southern Mongolia in September. Mongols organized large-scale demonstrations to protect their culture. Teachers went on strikes and students boycotted schools. Although Chinese authorities arrested a number of protesters, tens of thousands of Mongols continued their protest, holding banners such as ""Protect Mongolian Language"" and ""Stop the Assimilation Policy."" 

Many Mongolians initiated a petition on the White House website, calling on the outside world to support their protests, and asking Washington to prevent the CCP from destroying the Mongolian language and culture by removing Mongolian-language teaching in elementary schools. They believe the CCP is attempting to force Mongols to assimilate to the Han culture, which will lead to total extinction of Mongols as an ethnic group.
-----
On September 14, European Union leaders told Chinese leader Xi Jinping to open up markets, respect minorities, and step back from a crackdown in Hong Kong, also asserting that Europe would no longer be taken advantage of in trade.

Anxious to show that the EU will not take sides in a global standoff between China and the United States, German Chancellor Angela Merkel joined the bloc‚Äôs chief executive and chairman to deliver a tough-talking message to Beijing.

European Council President Charles Michel, who chaired the video summit, told reporters: ‚ÄúEurope is a player, not a playing field,‚Äù in reference to a growing sense in Europe that China has not met its promises to engage in fair and free trade.

China‚Äôs Xi was not part of the post-summit news conference and there was no joint statement, but the state-owned Xinhua News Agency reported that Xi rejected any interference in Chinese affairs, particularly on human rights.

2382,"EN GEDI, Israel ‚Äì It‚Äôs just not something many people ever get to see ‚Äì not close-up, not with their own eyes and even more rarely do they get to video record it for the rest of the world to see.

So it was a fantastic visual wildlife experience for WND‚Äôs annual Israel tour this month when participants, including founders Joseph and Elizabeth Farah, New York Times bestselling author Joel Richardson and Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll Hall of Famer Richie Furay, had a close encounter with dozens and dozens of the rare Nubian Ibex, the desert mountain goats of Bible renown.

It came in this little Dead Sea town where the young man who would become King David hid from his predecessor, the jealous and paranoid King Saul. It was in a cave overlooking the Ibex habitat that David cut off a piece of Saul‚Äôs tzit-zit fringe from his robe just to let the king know he could have killed him but chose to do him no harm.

Ibex were known as hinds in the Bible ‚Äì and they are mentioned frequently, in 2 Samuel 22:34, Job 39:1, Psalm 18:33, Psalm 29:9, Song of Solomon 2:7, Song of Solomon 3:5 and Habakkuk 3:19. It is first mentioned in Genesis 49:21: ‚ÄúNaphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.‚Äù

The Ibex is also referenced in the story of David‚Äôs encounter with Saul in En Gedi in 1 Samuel 24:1-2 ‚Äì but not by name.

‚ÄúAnd it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi. Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.‚Äù

Those wild goats are still there in the Judean Desert.

At first glance, the Ibex look like small deer, except for the large ram-like horns on the heads of the males. They are known for living in the roughest, steepest terrain they can find. Their hooves are built like suction cups to help them climb the rocky cliffs they call home. Those feet, with a sharp outer rim and a soft inner pad, also allow them to climb trees and munch on leaves.

The Ibex has another ability that allows them to climb the highest and rockiest mountains: When climbing cliffs, or even tree branches, their rear hooves can find the exact location of where their front feet were before taking a step.

Spotting an Ibex on a faraway cliff is considered a distinctive treat for most tourists visiting Israel. Photographing one at a distance even better. Seeing a half-dozen or so standing in a tree like goat ornaments is the kind of thing of which lifetime memories are made.

‚ÄúI have traveled to Israel and En Gedi many times over the last 35 years and I've never seen a spectacle like we witnessed earlier this month,"" said Joseph Farah about his Ibex encounter. ""I've seen them many times, but not like this ‚Äì not congregated by the dozens and hanging out in trees. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt even know they could do that.""

Messianic rabbi Jonathan Cahn, the two-time No. 1 New York Times bestselling author of ""The Harbinger"" and ""The Mystery of the Shemitah"" and a frequent pilgrim to Israel, also said he has never seen anything like the WND videos and photographs of the swarms of Ibex in trees.

""It was surreal,"" said Elizabeth Farah. ""We‚Äôre overlooking a gulley and there are these adorable creatures that look like miniature deer standing in a gorgeous Acacia tree. They don't flinch at the sight of people. It's like they are posing for a photo op. These are the kind of experiences we have every year on WND's annual Israel tours. There‚Äôs nothing else like it.""

Stunning new surveillance technology now makes it easier to keep tabs on people. The acquisition by police departments of major battlefield equipment emboldens officials to strong-arm those they should be protecting. The failure of the news media to report government violations of citizens‚Äô rights sets the stage for this slippery slope.

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

Even those students who had heard that the president was going to be on TV really didn't have any idea as to the details of what the president said.

We decided that simply determining that students aren't aware of major current events wasn't enough. We wanted to find out what they DID know about.  So we asked the same students if they knew what had happened to pop star, Justin Bieber the week before when he was arrested in Miami for driving under the influence, resisting arrest and driving without a valid license.  

It quickly became evident that every student at George Mason University knew what had happened to Justin Bieber on that fateful night in Miami.  Some described the events in great detail.

Heavy rain has been pounding Sichuan Province recently. A landslide in Hanyuan County, Ya 'a City, killed seven people and left two others missing in the early hours of Aug. 21. Local villagers said officials announced the evacuation too late. Ten families were buried in the landslide, and the government hasn‚Äôt been able to arrange accommodation for the evacuees, leaving them to find their own hotels.

Mr. Zhu, who owns a restaurant in Zhonghai Village, told The Epoch Times on the afternoon of  21th that his village had 200 to 300 families. The house that Mr. Zhu had spent about 3 million yuan to build was buried, along with his restaurant, cattle, and more than 200 carrier pigeons he kept.

Wiedemer gives viewers a dire wake-up call along with practical step-by-step guidelines that ordinary Americans can follow to protect and grow their wealth, even in these tumultuous times.

Robert Widemer prophetically predicted both the real estate and stock market collapse in his book, America's Bubble Economy (2006). In the wake of his anticipated economic disaster, Wiedemer penned a follow-up book, Aftershock, which immediately topped Amazon's bestseller list.

""I think everybody's got to relax on all this gay stuff.""
-- Bill O'Reilly, The O'Reilly Factor, August 15, 2007

From his suggestion that the ""secular progressive movement"" would like to have ""poly-amorphous"" marriage (""you can marry 18 people, you can marry a duck"") to his statement that it would be ""insane"" and ""inappropriate"" to ""cluster"" gays near children, Bill O' Reilly has never been one to ""relax on all this gay stuff.""

When O'Reilly isn't dishing the homophobia himself, he's giving others a platform on his show to bash the LGBT community -- featuring guests like Marc Rudov, who recently advanced the bogus notion that ""promoting a homosexual lifestyle"" of gays and lesbians would cause ""long-term consequences for children,"" that like a brain tumor, may take years to diagnose:

    RUDOV: If there's going to be a brain tumor, it might not be discovered for 10 years -- and I kind of look at this in the same way, because children do form their sexual identities from their same-sex parents. And what's going on here is basically teaching children that there's no difference between a heterosexual marriage and a homosexual marriage.

Fox News and O'Reilly use the topic of same-sex couples and their families to promote his show and incite fear of the LGBT community. Never was this practice more clear than when Fox used footage from Rosie O'Donnell's cruise for gay and lesbian couples and their families to promote an upcoming edition of the Factor. The promo raised the question: ""Is the media celebrating gay culture?"" You can probably guess what the answer was.

Of course, we all know this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to O'Reilly and his attacks on the LGBT community.

Last October on his nationally syndicated radio program, The Radio Factor, O'Reilly began a multi-day tirade against Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling and her popular Potter character, Dumbledore. During a promotion for his television program on his radio show, he said: ""We're also gonna tell you about Harry Potter and the gay agenda. Apparently that's goin' on."" That night on Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor, he asked ""Why have a gathering of Potter aficionados and then drop the gay bomb on them? Why do that? ... She did it to provoke. I think this is a provocateur."" The next night he escalated the rhetoric even further when he said that:

    ""There are millions of Americans who feel that the media and the educational system is trying to indoctrinate their children to a certain way of life, and that includes parity for homosexuals with heterosexuals. And that's what this Rowling thing is all about, because she sells so many books. So many kids read it, that she comes out and says, 'Oh, Dumbledore is gay, and that's great.' And this -- it's another in the indoctrination thing. That's what the belief system is among some Americans.""

After his guest, comedian Dennis Miller, pushed back by stating that children could not be indoctrinated into being gay, O'Reilly replied, ""No, but tolerance. It's -- you know, he's not going to be gay, but it's tolerance of it.""

Media Matters has documented numerous instances in which O'Reilly has attacked the LGBT community. Here are just three, but you can see the litany of his misinformation and attacks on the LGBT community at the end of this email:

    * O'Reilly criticized the inclusion of a lesbian couple as 'cutest couple' in a high school yearbook, saying: ""I think private behavior belongs in private settings. ... I don't think it belongs in the high school yearbook."" However, he said he would be OK with a heterosexual couple being cutest couple ""because that is the norm of society.""
    * O'Reilly suggested that allowing green cards for same-sex partners would lead to rampant immigration abuses.
    * O'Reilly called the San Diego Padres' decision to host a gay pride night and a children's hat giveaway promotion during the same baseball game ""dumb,"" ""almost unbelievable,"" and a ""mistake."" He said it was ""insane"" to ""cluster"" gay men and lesbians during a ""hat giveaway for any kid under 12,"" later adding: ""You're putting it in a kid's face at a baseball game."" O'Reilly also said: ""This is social engineering by the Padres."" 

It's time to tell O'Reilly and Fox News that enough is enough; if anyone should ""relax on all this gay stuff,"" it's Bill O'Reilly. I hope you'll take a moment to contact Fox News and The O'Reilly Factor today and make sure your voice is heard.",0,mediamatters4america

2466,"On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Christine Rosen joined host Ben Domenech to analyze the reasons for the recent protests and the aftermath, including defacing statues in an attempt to eliminate aspects of American history. Rosen is a senior writer at Commentary Magazine.

Rosen argued that public schools have failed to teach history to students, and instead have given them a warped view of the American founding, the product of which manifested itself in the recent destruction of historical statues. Schools are to blame, she said, for how little context young people have in understanding historical events.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not history. It‚Äôs propaganda,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe as leaders or as parents need to make sure we‚Äôre always pushing back on that but to persuade you have to teach and to teach you cannot teach anger and hostility, and so in this moment our job is to put out the small fires where we see them and try to think longer term about ways to teach especially the younger generation the positive history of their country.‚Äù

Charl van Wyk, author of Shooting Back, talks to WND TV about the Battle of Blood River, that took place in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa on December 16, 1838.

What would you do if armed terrorists broke into your church and starting attacking your friends with automatic weapons in the middle of a worship service?

Would you be prepared to defend yourself and other innocents?

Would you be justified in doing so?

Is it time for Americans to consider such once-unthinkable possibilities?

There is one man in the world who can address these questions with firsthand experience.

His name is Charl Van Wyk ‚Äì a South African who was faced with just such a shocking scenario.

In ""Shooting Back: The Right and Duty of Self-Defense,"" Van Wyk makes a biblical, Christian case for individuals arming themselves with guns, and does so more persuasively than perhaps any other author because he found himself in a church attacked by terrorists.

2487,"In the recent video footage obtained by Project Veritas, John Bonifield a Sr. Producer at CNN, admits to several beliefs that are in direct conflict with the official CNN narrative that Trump has colluded with Russia, and that Russia has interfered with the 2016 election.  Bonifield expresses clear doubts that there is a fire behind the Russia smoke, stating, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen any good enough evidence to show that the President committed a crime.‚Äù  He also confirms suspicions that CNN staff is ideologically biased against Trump, stating, ‚ÄúI know a lot of people don‚Äôt like him and they‚Äôd like to see him get kicked out of office‚Ä¶‚Äù   

Bonifield even further confirms CNN‚Äôs bias against the President, stating, ‚ÄúI think the President is probably right to say, like, look you are witch hunting me...you have no real proof.‚Äù

Bonifield exposes that Russia has been great for CNN‚Äôs ratings, and that orders from CEO Jeff Zucker himself have directed CNN to pursue Russia leads at the expense of other stories.  Bonifield states ‚ÄúAnd the CEO of CNN said in our internal meeting, he said ‚Äògood job everybody covering the Climate Accords, but we‚Äôre done with it let‚Äôs get back to Russia.‚Äô‚Äù 

He further comments on Russia, ‚Äúit‚Äôs mostly bullshit right now.  Like, we don‚Äôt have any giant proof...if it was something really good, it‚Äôd leak.‚Äù

2535,"On this episode of the The Federalist Radio Hour, Wilfred Reilly joined host Ben Domenech to explore how Americans have felt in recent months during the lockdown and protests and how the media encourages their fears. Reilly is an assistant professor of political science at the University of Kentucky and has written multiple books, most recently ‚ÄúHate Crime Hoax: How the Left is Selling a Fake Race War,‚Äù and ‚ÄúTaboo: 10 Facts You Can‚Äôt Talk About.‚Äù

Reilly argues the media often focuses on the worst and least likely of situations to gain more views and clicks on their stories, which results in a needlessly terrified public. He also blamed the media for the current widespread tension between Americans.

‚ÄúThe media benefits from‚Ä¶ people tuning into things that they‚Äôre existentially afraid of and feeling that little trimmer of terror,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd the media has definitely exploited that with two recent stories: Covid19 and the protests and riots following the death of George Floyd.‚Äù

Young and middle-aged residents of coastal regions near China‚Äôs Yellow Sea had never seen a typhoon before. The last time a typhoon swept through the area was in 1964.

On the morning of Aug. 27, Typhoon Bavi made landfall in an area near the China-North Korea border, damaging homes and buildings, flooded roads, and toppling utility poles in North Korea.

China‚Äôs coastal city of Dalian located in Liaoning Province suspended all business and school operations, as well as train services.

Bavi packed maximum winds of 82 miles per hour near the eye of the storm. It was the strongest storm to develop in the Yellow Sea in the past 70 years.

Even before the arrival of Bavi, heavy rainstorms had already flooded Liaoning‚Äôs capital city of Shenyang on Aug. 24 and the coastal city of Qingdao in Shandong Province on Aug. 26. The city‚Äôs airport runways were flooded and flights had to land on runways that were covered in several inches of water. 

The northeastern region of China is the country‚Äôs agricultural base. Autumn crops such as corn, soybeans, and rice are about to fully mature. Typhoon Bavi will inevitably cause huge losses to farmers in the affected area. 

Bavi is the 8th typhoon to have formed in the Pacific this year. So far all eight typhoons have circumvented Taiwan, leaving the island state largely unscathed.

""The award show season is dead this year, but the spin is going to be 'this is just a one-off. Everything's going to come back. That's going to be the way it was. Everybody's gonna love it there's gonna be a ton of successful blockbusters in the coming year, etc.' I'm more skeptical about that,"" Domenech said.

On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor of The Federalist and Sean Davis, co-founder of The Federalist, discuss the highs, lows, and embarrassing moments for Democrats at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.

""It was actually depressing to hear what they think about this country and how irredeemable it is and evil and awful and then I would be kind of disappointed because then they would move into like let's be patriotic and it's like you're kind of all over the place,"" Hemingway noted. ""It was very hard to see it but lots of just depressing horrible like we've never been in a worse place. I know that when you are the out party you have to paint a dystopian picture of the party. But it was so joyless and depressing and the lack of people certainly added to that.""

Not only did the convention prove to be disappointing, but Davis said it showed Biden and the media's true colors. 

""We saw it from Ryan Lizza and Tim Alberta at Politico as this seemingly over the top characterization that this will be the speech that defines Joe Biden's career. Nevermind that he's been in politics for 50 years, eight of them in the White House. I think he's pretty well defined before reading his speech last night,"" Davis said.

""I think the media delivered in all the ways I thought they would. They did not get the point. They were cartoonish and absurd and ridiculous and I love it. Because I love it when they show you who they are and they stopped hiding it,"" Davis added.

Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have expressed that the system is broken, but a consensus on any solution seems untenable. In this video, Atlantic national correspondent James Fallows and contributing writer Deborah Fallows ventured across the country to bridge the disconnect between national political rhetoric on immigration and the realities in migrant communities. They travelled to three American states‚ÄîPennsylvania, California, and Kansas‚Äîto understand the economic benefits that immigrants bring to the small towns they most often reside in.

This documentary was produced for American Futures, an ongoing reporting project from James and Deborah Fallows. The couple has spent three years exploring small town America by air, ‚Äútaking seriously places that don‚Äôt usually get registered seriously.‚Äù

The man said:
Let‚Äôs take a look here, and I will tell you one thing. This is a Foxconn factory near the Youfu Market Place.
Almost all of the trees have been chopped down so that you see the bright sky. 
I am going to tell you that Foxconn is on a long vacation.
Normally, it‚Äôs a three to five day holiday on May 1, Labor Day weekend, but Foxconn will extend that to four months until September 1 for some employees.
Foxconn will subsidize about $6,000 yuan ($850 USD) for the entire four months and work will resume on September 1.
See, people are leaving with their luggages, this is Foxconn in Longhua Town.
The workers on long leave are the ones in Guanlan Research Park.
This year the market is bad, that‚Äôs why you see there‚Äôll be four months off.
To those who have worked everyday, it can be considered good news because you get to stay home with your parents and relax for four months.
But I believe many people have not worked since January or February.
You have not had any income for a while and so you don‚Äôt want to take a leave at all.
Those who still have a job are lucky.
I have seen many factories stop hiring.
Boys find it hard to land a job. So, if you have a job, hold on to it.

A netizen posted a comment to the video:
PhoenixWan wrote: This welfare ($850 USD) is available only because Foxconn‚Äôs owner is from Taiwan. A Chinese owner would directly close down or set fire to the plant.


During the pandemic, the shrinking economy is hitting Chinese workers hard. What was once the world‚Äôs factory suffers from a lack of overseas orders. Chinese workers also suffer from a lack of governmental relief aid. Foxconn, an electronics contract manufacturer, has several factories in Shenzhen, China. Even though the regime pushed people to go back to work, Foxconn had to furlough workers for four months due to a drop in export orders.

The water coming into the dam reached 75,000 cubic meters per second on the morning of Aug. 20, the highest level since the dam was commissioned in 2003. 

Water levels and flood volume in Yangtze River‚Äôs Chongqing section, which is immediately upstream of the dam, both exceeded the previous historical record set in 1981. In the riverside districts, residents who live on the first and second floors were required to evacuate. 

The dam opened 11 spillways to discharge water, at a record speed of 49,200 cubic meters per second, as downstream Wuhan issued an orange alert for more rainstorms to come.

2615,"Order your copy of Debunking Utopia here: http://superstore.wnd.com/Debunking-Utopia-Exposing-the-Myth-of-Nordic-Socialism-Paperback-Autographed

Left-leaning academics, liberal pop stars such as Bruce Springsteen, and Democrat politicians from Bernie Sanders to Bill and Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama all have one thing in common: they are avid admirers of Nordic-style social democracy. The reason is simple. At first glance, Nordic countries seem to have everything liberals want to see in America: equal income distribution, good health, low levels of poverty, and thriving economies, all co-existing with big welfare states. By copying Nordic policies, many in the American left hope to transform America to a similar socialist ""utopia.""

In Debunking Utopia, Swedish author Nima Sanandaji explains why this is all wishful thinking. Certainly, some aspects of Nordic welfare states, such as childcare provision, merit the admiration of liberals. But overall, it is a unique culture based on hard work, healthy diets, social cohesion and high levels of trust that have made Nordic countries successful. Sanandaji explains how the Nordic people adopted this culture of success in order to survive in the unforgiving Scandinavian climate. He systematically proves that the high levels of income equality, high lifespans and other signs of social success in the Nordics all predate the expansion of the welfare state. If anything, the Nordic countries reached their peak during the mid-twentieth century, when they had low taxes and small welfare states. Perhaps most astonishing are his findings that Nordic-Americans consistently outperform their cousins who live across the ocean. People of Nordic descent who live under the American capitalist system not only enjoy higher levels of income, but also a lower level of poverty than the citizens of the Nordic countries themselves.

What can we do when our God-given right to self-defense is legislated away from us?

2671,"There are more than 6,000 men currently imprisoned at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola‚Äîthree-quarters of them are there for life, and nearly 80 percent are African American. It's the end of the line for many convicted criminals in Louisiana, which has the highest incarceration rate of any state in the U.S. In this Atlantic original documentary, national correspondent Jeffrey Goldberg goes inside Angola to speak with inmates and with warden Burl Cain, who has managed the prison for two decades. Cain and his colleagues grapple with the crucial question: What does rehabilitation look like when you're locked away for life?
 
Read Goldberg's recent reflection on the filmmaking process (http://theatln.tc/1MmKfuG), as well as his in-depth report on crime in Louisiana, ""A Matter of Black Lives,"" from The Atlantic's September issue (http://theatln.tc/1HE39rg).

Racial violence is back. Along with widespread racial crime ‚Äì even riots. In hundreds of episodes in more than 80 cities since 2010, groups of black people have been roaming the streets of America ‚Äì assaulting, intimidating, stalking, threatening, vandalizing, stealing, shooting, stabbing, even raping and killing. In cities big and small. In ways expected and unexpected. But local media and public officials are silent.

Crime is colorblind, says a Milwaukee police chief. Race is not important, a Chicago newspaper editor assures us. That denies the obvious: America is the most race-conscious society in the world. We learn that every day from black caucuses, black teachers, black unions, black ministers, black colleges, black high schools, black music, black moguls, black hair business owners, black public employees, black art, black names, black poets, black inventors, black soldiers, black police officers. We learn it in stories written by members of the National Association of Black Journalists. We talk about everything except black mob violence and lawlessness. That is Taboo. Result: Few know about it. Fewer still are talking about it.

Today it is at epidemic levels in almost every city in the country. The list of cities under attack is long and getting longer ‚Äì with some cities suffering dozens of attacks in the last few years alone: Chicago. Miami. Philadelphia. Las Vegas. New York. Atlantic City. Milwaukee. Charlotte. Mobile. Kansas City. Denver. Birmingham. Saratoga Springs. Seattle. Portland. Nashville. Washington, D.C. Los Angeles. Rochester. Wilmington. Georgetown. Greensboro. Nashville. Peoria. Vallejo. Des Moines. Dallas. Rehoboth Beach. Baltimore. Montgomery County. Boston. St. Louis. Brighton Beach. And more, more, more. Des Moines, Iowa? Yes, at the Iowa State Fair, no less ‚Äì during what one cop called Beat Whitey Night. Peoria, Illinois? Absolutely: As many as nine race riots in 2011 alone ‚Äì right in the middle of Middle America. Milwaukee? Yes, on the Fourth of July, after looting a nearby convenience store, a crowd of nearly 100 blacks set upon some white teens on a picnic. After beating one white woman, a black woman noted, ‚ÄúOh white girl bleed a lot.‚Äù And the Milwaukee state fair is probably the most explicit and public hate crime anyone has seen in years. Hundreds of black people roamed the fairgrounds, targeting white people for violence.

2702,"Coronavirus disease, or COVID-19, has traveled across the world, and its numbers‚Äîof new infections and deaths‚Äîare quite distressing.

As COVID-19 spreads, so does fear, prejudice and xenophobia, or a fear of ‚Äúforeigners.‚Äù The virus appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and Chinese people (along with other East Asian folks) have been turned into villains‚Äîthose thought to be the carriers of this disease. Hence, the rise of a more specific form of bigotry: sinophobia, or the fear of Chinese people.

Merlin Chowkwanyun is a historian and an assistant professor of socio-medical sciences at Columbia University. He says that this idea that people from other countries carry contagious disease dates back to the 19th century. Chowkwanyun says that a pandemic like COVID-19 causes people to look for scapegoats, or ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù and creates a ‚Äúrhetoric of blame.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd it [the rhetoric of blame] really follows a couple, I think, basic themes that have been remarkably persistent through many, many decades, across centuries. One is that the outsiders have this kind of intrinsic quality, something maybe biological, but it makes them more prone to getting diseases and to affecting others,‚Äù Chowkwanyun said. ‚ÄúAnd the other [theme] is sort of related to that‚Äîbut I think it‚Äôs a distinct‚Äîit‚Äôs that these outsiders behave badly so they don‚Äôt clean themselves. They eat strange foods. They live in cluttered spaces, very cramped spaces.‚Äù

One day after a prominent U.S. Muslim leader reacted to the November 2015 Paris attacks with a declaration that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has nothing to do with Islam, President Obama made the same assertion.

Who exactly is the enemy we face, not only in the Middle East but also within our borders? Is it ""murderers without a coherent creed"" or ""nihilistic killers who want to tear things down,"" as some described ISIS after 130 people were brutally slain and another 368 injured in a coordinated attack on Western soil that authorities say was organized with help from inside France's Muslim communities.

After the Paris attacks, Obama, himself, described ISIS as ""simply a network of killers who are brutalizing local populations.""

But how much do words and definitions really matter? According to the legendary military strategist Sun Tzu, if ""you do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one (battle) and lose one; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.""

When the Department of Homeland Security was founded in 2003, its stated purpose was ""preventing terrorist attacks within the United States and reducing America's vulnerability to terrorism."" The Bush administration's definition of the enemy as a tactic, terrorism, rather than a specific movement, proved consequential amid a culture of political correctness. By the time President Obama took office, Muslim Brotherhood-linked leaders in the United States were forcing changes to national security policy and even being invited into the highest chambers of influence. A policy known as Countering Violent Extremism emerged, downplaying the threat of supremacist Islam as unrelated to the religion and just one among many violent ideological movements.

When recently retired DHS frontline officer and intelligence expert Philip Haney bravely tried to say something about the people and organizations that threatened the nation, his intelligence information was eliminated, and he was investigated by the very agency assigned to protect the country. The national campaign by the DHS to raise public awareness of terrorism and terrorism-related crime known as If You See Something, Say Something effectively has become If You See Something, Say Nothing.

In ""See Something, Say Nothing,"" Haney ‚Äì a charter member of DHS with previous experience in the Middle East ‚Äì and co-author Art Moore expose just how deeply the submission, denial and deception run. Haney's insider, eyewitness account, supported by internal memos and documents, exposes a federal government capitulating to an enemy within and punishing those who reject its narrative.

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

2728,"Many religious voters feel alienated from the Democratic Party, says Atlantic staff writer Emma Green. Why haven‚Äôt liberals tried harder to reach the broad percentage of Americans who identify as religious? ‚ÄúDemocrats in Washington often have trouble speaking in religious terms, and they reflect a broader liberal culture that doesn‚Äôt take religion seriously,‚Äù she explains. But this is an uncomfortable shift, one that has a political costs. Previous progressive figures have actively relied on religious rhetoric to move policies forward. Martin Luther King Jr. and Jimmy Carter, for example, framed their ideals in religious terms and audiences were receptive. Is it time for Democrats to incorporate religious identity back into their outreach and politics?

Welcome to Unpresidented, a new series from The Atlantic where writers explore different aspects of this new era in American politics. Comment with questions and suggestions for topics to cover.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Graphics in this video show symbols of many faiths, including a Star of David. One image of that star, associated with Judaism, originally contained a cross‚Äîa combination typically associated with a movement known as Messianic Judaism, whose adherents identify as Jewish believers in Jesus. We have replaced the original symbol with a standard Star of David in certain parts of the video, including the image at the beginning.

Nineteen days before Christmas 2018, the school board in West Point, Virginia, voted unanimously to fire Vlaming. Today, he awaits his day in court.¬†

2766,"WND TV interviews Dr. Paul Kengor, author of Takedown, about why he wrote his book 'Takedown'.

We are witnessing a watershed moment in American cultural history: the sabotaging of family and marriage. Extreme-left radicals have made their arguments and tried different tactics, from the early nineteenth century to the sexual revolution of the 1960s, but at long last they have the vehicle to make it happen: gay marriage. Now, as the legal definition of marriage rapidly changes, the floodgates are open, and the fundamental transformation of the American family will take on new speed and new dimensions. Efforts to redefine the family structure have been long at work, and there have been some influential forces on the far left and communist left that cannot and should not be ignored in that process.

In ""Takedown"" Paul Kengor exposes these origins, starting with Karl Marx, and traces them through the sordid history of people like Margaret Sanger, Wilhelm Reich, Herbert Marcuse and assorted '60s radicals. What were once fringe concepts have become accepted by mainstream thought and are today welcomed by many legislators and judges. Kengor notes how in the not-so-distant past, today's leftists who are attacking traditional marriage would have loudly raised their voices but not caused any real damage. They would have been dismissed with no serious concern as left-wing cranks, crackpot German and Austrian atheistic philosophers and campus agitators. But now, with formal legalization of same-sex marriage afoot, they are getting what they‚Äôve wanted for generations: the literal redefinition of the family.

""Takedown"" exposes how gay marriage is serving as a Trojan horse for the far left to secure the final takedown of marriage that it has long wanted, and countless everyday Americans are oblivious to the deeper forces at work. ""Takedown"" takes no prisoners and bluntly shows the reader that even Karl Marx and his more anti-marriage comrade Engels would be dumbfounded at the mere thought that modern Americans would gladly join them in their rejection of God's design for natural marriage and the family.

Schools resume in China despite pandemic still likely being severe.

In Zhejiang Province, parents were requested to make hats with one meter brims for their children to wear to school. Students are attending school with facial masks and these hats to socially distance. 
Anecdotal accounts from netizens??? have revealed that the pandemic situation is still severe in China, although the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs (CCP) ongoing cover up of the outbreak and censorship of COVID-19-related information has parents trusting the regime, which claims that China is nearly free of the virus. But the lack of transparent information is putting these children‚Äôs lives at risk.

On the wall, there‚Äôs also a banner that reads, ‚ÄúGive My Child Back, Give Me The Truth.‚Äù

A man said while shooting the video:
 ""The school has not yet come out to solve the problem. The kid died yesterday afternoon. Please everyone look at this and share this video around to your circle of friends.‚Äù

According to a netizen‚Äôs comment, the child had a headache.
Rather than notifying the parents or taking the kid to the doctor, the school kept the kid isolated. After the student‚Äôs death, the parents defended their rights in front of the school to know how their child had died and recover the body.

Chinese woman just released from hospital tells the driver that several coronavirus patients were taken to crematorium while still alive.

Location: Wuhan City, Hubei Province

Woman: I saw it with my own eyes. I was at hospital bed no. 18, he was in bed no. 17. He was sent to the hospital on Jan. 28 in the morning. That same afternoon, a medical team from Tianjin city arrived at the hospital. He could only exhale, but could not inhale. I think he was experiencing the same symptoms as I did. Because I am younger, and he is in his seventies, he could not hold on.  
 
I can tell you, when one is infected with this virus, the key is whether he or she can make it through the most difficult time. Those who can will survive. Those who cannot will pass away. 
 
Driver: So he was not dead yet?
 
Woman: Yes, he could still breathe. When they came to bind his body, his hands and feet were still moving. They bound his feet together, bound his hands together. Then, they had a plastic  black bag. They put him in the bag and zipped it. They wrapped him in another bag, and then a third bag, layer by layer. The outermost layer is like the material tents are made out of. Altogether, there were four layers of bags. Then, they tied the bags with a rope.
 
Driver: So they did not attempt to rescue him?
 
Woman: The only equipment you can use to rescue a patient is oxygen supply. No other equipment. 
 
Driver: That means, a person still alive was directly sent to..
 
Woman: No other equipment to rescue. It is a hospital designated for contagious diseases. The hospital forms specified that it is a hospital for contagious diseases.
 
Driver: People who are still alive are sent to the crematorium?!
 
Woman: They are afraid that the virus will spread, to tell you the truth. 
 
Driver: My gosh!
 
Woman: I saw several patients who were handled like this. In the ward next to mine, an old man obviously still had breath left, but they sent him to the crematorium. 
 
Driver: Wow! My gosh! Several people were handled this way. That is equal to...
 
Woman: Yes, we all saw these with our own eyes, when we were hospitalized, with my own eyes. I was grief-stricken. I really feel‚Ä¶ I really wanted to cry. So miserable, so tragic!
 
Driver: My gosh, this is too cruel. The important thing is, he is still alive. They should try to save him!
 
Woman: How can they save him? What can they use to save him? There is no (effective) medicine, no nothing. There is only oxygen supply. What can they use to save patients? Really... You didn‚Äôt get a chance to see it. Those who were carried away in bags, they were handled like dead dogs. As soon as one person dies, he would be placed into the yellow checkered bags and then carried away.

The CCP virus has prompted the manufacturing industry to consider diversifying its supply chains. According to reports from Indian newspaper The Economic Times, Apple is planning to shift nearly a fifth of its production from China to India. Experts say the scale of investment, around $40 billion over the next five years, could also make India the largest exporter of Apple products, the report said. 

Apple‚Äôs CEO Tim Cook said in an interview: ‚ÄúWe are really doing that, so as a part of this trip, the maps facility will be several hundred million dollars. And so all of these things add up to a significant amount of economic activity.‚Äù 

Cook started investing in India four years ago. As the pandemic takes a toll on the global economy, supply chains are shifting away from China. Apple is accelerating its plans to open factories in India. According to The Economic Times, the Indian government in March approved the Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for large-scale electronics manufacturing. The goal of the PLI is to increase the production of electronic components, semiconductors, and mobile phone components, creating 200,000 new jobs over five years. Indian officials revealed that Apple is considering shifting 20 percent of its production capacity out of China, which sums up to around $40 billion in investment over the next five years, The Economic Times reported.

Vice President of Taishin Securities Investment Advisory, Huang Wenqing said: ‚Äú(The U.S. block on China‚Äôs) technology, as well as the tariff trade barrier, are issues that might heat up again in the future. Therefore, it is likely that China-based production bases, such as Honghai [Foxconn], will start to shift their production capacity outwards.‚Äù

Although 90 percent of Apple‚Äôs products are currently assembled in China, its main supplier‚ÄîTaiwanese manufacturer Foxconn‚Äîhas long begun laying out strategies (to build factories) in India. Foxconn signed a pact with India in August 2015 to invest $5 billion over five years. In fact, Foxconn manufactured and assembled the iPhone XR in India last year. 

Wistron Corp has long begun producing affordable versions of the iPhone SE, as well as the subsequent iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 related products in South India since 2017. 

Some experts say that Apple has not only focused on the domestic market, but has also gone further to make India a major production and export hub. 

Industry Analyst of Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, Qiu Shifang said (during a phone interview): ‚ÄúIn the past, Apple's main production capacity was highly concentrated in China, which made it difficult to shift its production elsewhere. The supply chain of Taiwanese manufacturers may also be required to match the needs of downstream original brand manufacturers (OBM). For component manufacturers, the apparent overall elongation in the supply chain will make them face a certain degree of challenge.‚Äù

According to The Nikkei, Apple plans to transfer up to 30 percent of production of its popular Airpods from China to Vietnam, amounting to about 3 to 4 million pairs. Apple's plan to shift its production capacity away from China in the medium to long term has clearly become an irreversible trend.

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and host of the The Daily Wire‚Äôs podcast ‚ÄúThe Michael Knowles Show‚Äù Michael Knowles joined Culture Editor Emily Jashinsky to discuss everything from censorship by big tech to TikTok and the Chinese Communist Party. Sen. Cruz and Knowles co-host the political podcast ‚ÄúVerdict With Ted Cruz‚Äù in which Cruz gives his take on the most important national news.

The senator argued that although media bias has been around forever, it‚Äôs immensely dangerous that a handful of monopolies now control every means of discourse. Similarly to China, the left, who controls all the major institutions in America, doesn‚Äôt want people to thoughtfully communicate their ideas because they don‚Äôt work. They must suppress free speech and silence the truth, Sen. Cruz said, because truth prevails if the discourse allows for it.

‚ÄúI think the threat of of big tech censorship is the single greatest threat that democracy faces, that political discourses faces, that free speech faces. We‚Äôve got a handful of giant monopolies with massive power, and their arrogance is growing exponentially. And they have demonstrated a repeated willingness to silence, to stifle, to muzzle speech they disagree with,‚Äù he said.

Stay tuned for the Baby Yoda cameo.

Recently We Media published a video introducing every single unfinished building in the county. The video went viral. Local residents revealed that the local government is extremely corrupt and the lands to build these unfinished infrastructures were purchased from the locals with low prices. Many houses were demolished by the government without notice and compensation. Local residents are being suppressed by the government for defending their rights.

The video also shows that the same problem exists in Sandu County, near Dushan County. Sandu County is also a poor county and has 10 billion yuan in debts ($1.4 billion USD). There are many expensive investments of unfinished buildings that cost billions of dollars.

2914,"Campus Reform Digital Reporter Eduardo Neret spoke to college students about another nationwide coronavirus shutdown after Joe Biden recently said he would shut the country if elected president.

FULL STORY: After Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden recently said he would institute another nationwide coronavirus shutdown if that's what the public health experts recommended, Campus Reform asked students about the idea and, without naming Biden, asked if they would support a presidential candidate who would implement another shutdown.

Biden recently told ABC News during an exclusive interview that if he is elected president and a second coronavirus wave hits the country, and if scientists recommended shutting down the country yet again, ""I would shut it down.""

However, most students said they do not want another shutdown.

‚ÄúIf you shut down, obviously it affects people‚Äôs jobs, people‚Äôs livelihoods in terms of how they make their money and how they make income,‚Äù one student said.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really support [another shutdown] cause I feel like we‚Äôre slowly making progress towards it and it was so hard on a lot of people, who you said, lost their jobs--students especially--when things were completely shut down,‚Äù another student added.

Campus Reform then mentioned that this was Biden‚Äôs proposal, and asked students to react.

‚ÄúA little surprised yeah, that is kind of shocking,‚Äù one student said upon learning this was Biden‚Äôs proposal.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost my grandmother to coronavirus, but people still have to keep their jobs,‚Äù one student said in his argument against another shutdown.

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

In a WND TV interview, Charl van Wyk, author of Shooting Back, talks about anarchy in South Africa.

What would you do if armed terrorists broke into your church and starting attacking your friends with automatic weapons in the middle of a worship service?

Would you be prepared to defend yourself and other innocents?

Would you be justified in doing so?

Is it time for Americans to consider such once-unthinkable possibilities?

There is one man in the world who can address these questions with firsthand experience.

His name is Charl Van Wyk ‚Äì a South African who was faced with just such a shocking scenario.

In ""Shooting Back: The Right and Duty of Self-Defense,"" Van Wyk makes a biblical, Christian case for individuals arming themselves with guns, and does so more persuasively than perhaps any other author because he found himself in a church attacked by terrorists.

According to a report from the Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch, starting August 1, the public security, traffic officers, quality supervision and industry and commerce departments of Shaoyang city in Hunan have jointly conducted a comprehensive clean-up of production, sales, driving, and maintenance of electric bicycles in Shaoyang city.

As of August 7th, thousands of electric bicycles were confiscated and temporarily impounded. That day, large-scale clashes broke out between thousands of residents who were fed up with Shaoyang police. The residents gathered quickly on the streets and marched to the city government and department of traffic police, demanding the removal of restrictions that make ordinary people‚Äôs lives difficult.

In a rights protection statement, Shaoyang people demanded to reopen registration and issuing the license plates for electric vehicles; to allow non-city plated electric vehicles to enter the Shaoyang city; To simplify the licensing procedures, not requiring residents to provide documents that cannot be provided as the basis for licensing; to add more service windows for the licensing verification; to release the impounded motorcycles and electric vehicles; and the processing time for impounding vehicles should not exceed 3 days.

On the same day, a reply from the Secretary of the Municipal Legal Committee was posted in Wechat: ""From tomorrow on, all county-licensed electric vehicles can temporarily enter the city and will not be impounded. The impounded vehicles will be released in order.""

------------------
When Wuhan officials announced zero new infections on March 18, new cases were reported online on March 19.
During an interview on March 21 with Mr. Gao from Wuhans' Qiaokou District, The Epoch Times learned that a reemergence of the CCP virus, which causes the disease COVID-19, had occurred. 
-
Mr. Gao: The virus has reemerged. It started again. There were reports about it yesterday.
Tongji Medical College, Qiaokou, has confirmed more than 100 cases of infection. It was reported yesterday. The reason I‚Äôm saying this is because it was reported. If I don‚Äôt mention it, the facts will be hidden and none of it will come to light.
Reporter: Was the virus recurring, or is it new?
Mr. Gao: Who knows. I‚Äôm quarantined at home.
There was a case today near our community. A 62-year-old woman ran away and now she‚Äôs gone missing. 
Reporter: Where are the people who were released from the makeshift hospitals?
Mr. Gao: They were isolated first and then went home. We didn‚Äôt see any news in the chat room about their health and safety.
Reporter: It‚Äôs quite scary. Are you worried?
Mr. Gao: Most definitely. Life is getting harder. The government doesn't care, we have no money on hand, and when you go out, you need to pay in order to have fun.
Reporter: So the situation remains the same, am I right?
Mr. Gao: Yes, the same. Things are a little more relaxed in my community. But we‚Äôre still very worried for others. The regime is talking about ensuring zero new infections. No new infections, that's their goal.
Reporter: But there are cases of new infections.
Mr. Gao: How can I say it ‚Ä¶ the virus ‚Äòobeys‚Äô the regime. If the regime says there are no new cases, then there will be ‚Äòno new cases.‚Äô The virus will not listen to the capitalists, but the socialists, in the party‚Äôs view.
Reporter: This is frightening if it continues on like this.
Mr. Gao: True, but there's no other way. We live in fear, fear of getting sick from someone who is infected or a carrier.
Mr. Gao: People are now starting to use common sense. No gatherings, no parties, no wandering around in public.",1,The Epoch Times

2988,"Florida Campus Correspondent Ophelie Jacobson asked students about the recent movement to remove ""racist"" statues, figures, and institutions from society. After agreeing with the movement, Jacobson then presented students with this quote from Planned Parenthood Founder Margaret Sanger: ""We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population."" 

Most students agreed the quote was racist, but walked back their previous remarks when they found out the quote was Sanger's. Many still said they support Planned Parenthood.

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

------------------

Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, recently emphasized the idea of ""internal economic circulation,"" meaning having domestic sectors provide all the goods needed for Chinese consumption, from raw materials to manufacturing. This sparked public concern. Experts believe that the majority of people in China have limited income and purchasing power, and if the CCP wants to emphasize domestic circulation to save its economy, then China may return to the ‚Äústate of closure‚Äù from 40 years ago.

On July 30, Xi Jinping once again emphasized in the Politburo meeting that the economy will rely on the domestic market and focus on internal circulation to stabilize the economy in China. This is the third time in the last two months that Xi has mentioned it. Experts think that Beijing is trying to use internal circulation as an ‚Äúantidote‚Äù to the economic impasse in which the CCP finds itself. 

Ren Zhong-Dao, a researcher at Dailymotion, believes that while facing global sanctions and gradually becoming an isolated country, the CCP has no choice but to make a claim to deceive its people. In fact, it is going back to the ‚Äústate of closure‚Äù. ‚ÄúSince 1979, all western countries have been supporting China and helping China develop economically. But all these countries have left China now because of the CCP‚Äôs evil deeds. The CCP has no other choice but to bluff, saying that they will survive by having internal economic circulation and internal consumer markets,‚Äù he said.
China‚Äôs economy and employment heavily relies on exports. On June 28, the Premier of China, Li Keqiang, admitted in a meeting with government officials and enterprise executives that the foreign trade environment is still grave and complex, and it is necessary to help large enterprises solve foreign trade problems in order to stabilize employment. He also warned in the meeting that development behind closed doors is not going to work.

Ren indicated that although there are 1.4 billion Chinese people, they do not have enough purchasing power. If there is no foreign trade, China‚Äôs internal circulation will become a dead circulation. Coupled with economic depression and massive unemployment, the Chinese people, who are impoverished by the CCP, will also lose their desire to consume. He said, ‚ÄúThe citizens will not want to consume and will be afraid of spending money. Their financial situation is not great, they face unemployment and have large debts and mortgages. When the consumer markets are not active, the so-called internal circulation will not work.‚Äù

On July 31, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted an analysis saying that high ranking CCP officials had no choice but to emphasize internal economic circulation because the CCP is now facing the dilemma of decoupling. Lao Mang, a well-known finance blogger in China, wrote an article that the ""internal economic circulation"" would send China's economy back to 40 years ago overnight.

3028,"American families are the backbone of this nation. The American family is the fundamental institution that provided the Founding Fathers with the emotional support and driving courage to face the tyrannical government that threatened their very existence. It is the essential building block of a free society with limited government.

The American family used to be the fundamental institution of our stable, liberty-loving and very successful society, but in the last hundred years it has been attacked, debased, maligned, slandered and vilified by every facet of society. At issue is a rebellion against any sort of moral code, and no family is safe from the official busybodies.

‚ÄúWho Killed the American Family?‚Äù reveals the concerted assault on the American nuclear family by many forces: feminists, judges, lawmakers, psychologists, school districts, college professors, politicians offering incentives and seeking votes, and more, each opposed to the traditional American nuclear family and each with its own raison d'√™tre for wanting to abolish it. The wreckage of the American family leaves us with the inability to have limited government, because government steps in to perform tasks formerly done by the nuclear family.

A veteran conservative activist and thought leader who led the charge to successfully defeat the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s, Phyllis Schlafly explains how changes in the law, in court decisions, in the culture, in education and in entertainment have eroded the once-precious institution. Any of these factors on its own would not have been enough to impact our families, but together they add up to a mighty force. Schlafly not only exposes the tactical charge the left has implemented, but she offers hope and a plan for stopping anti-marriage incentives and restoring in our culture the sacred nature of the family unit.",1,WorldNetDaily

On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Tiana Lowe, a commentary writer for the Washington Examiner, joins Culture Editor Emily Jashinsky to discuss her recent article ""Hillbilly Elegy hate proves J.D. Vance's importance to conservatism""  and how millennials from a wide range of positions within the Right are reshaping it.

""I think that millennials have to stop letting Boomers and specifically the boomer establishment hijack every movement that actually comes from the grassroots,"" Lowe said. 

According to Lowe, there are many opportunities for conservative and libertarian millennials to capitalize on their generation's distrust in elite institutions and use it to reshape the party to unite against power-hungry, money-grabbing universities and human rights abuser communist China. 

""There could be some unity where we see an inherently unfair system,"" Lowe said. ""In a sane world, China should be the unifying issue.""

""Quite frankly, there is a niche issue for everyone in there,"" she added.

Beijing‚Äôs flagship foreign policy initiative, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), has been mired in controversy since its inception, with critics warning that Beijing‚Äôs infrastructure projects place developing countries under a ‚Äúdebt trap‚Äù by offering unsustainable loans, while exploiting their natural resources to drive the Chinese economy.

Now, two letters from the South Pacific nation of Samoa have revealed how one Chinese construction project‚Äîbeing overseen by the government of Huizhou city in southern China‚Äîhas been mired with quality problems and work practices that could harm the environment.

Sent by a trusted source, The Epoch Times received the letters and a set of internal documents which were sent from the Huizhou government showing that the Guangdong provincial government ordered the city to build projects in Samoa, which fit into Beijing‚Äôs political agenda. Huizhou is a municipal-level city in Guangdong Province.

The Military and Security Developments Involving the People‚Äôs Republic of China 2020 Annual Report to Congress, which was released by the US Department of Defense in early September, discloses the so-called ""Military-Civil Fusion (MCF) Development Strategy"" of the Chinese military's modernization and how private companies have become the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)‚Äôs military companies to help build its military strength.

The Report points out that from the perspective of research and development, the CCP has adjusted its research institutions in the military field, paying special attention to MCF development Strategy.

The Trump administration has introduced countermeasures against the CCP's policy of Military-Civil Fusion. On Apr. 28, the US Commerce Department issued a new ban to prevent advanced technology from being diverted by the CCP for military use. On Aug. 17, the Commerce Department further blocked Huawei, cutting off its access to chips. On Jun. 20, the Pentagon identified 20 Chinese companies as owned or controlled by the CCP military. On Aug. 28, another 11 Chinese companies were added to the list.

Chinese poet Wang Zang and his wife Wang Liqin were charged with the so-called ""inciting subversion of state power"". Their cases were recently transferred to the Chuxiong Prefecture Procuratorate in Yunnan Province for review and prosecution. On September 17, Wang Zang met with a lawyer for the first time. According to a report, on the morning of September 17, Sichuan lawyer Lu Siwei and Beijing lawyer Zhang Lei met with Wang Zang at the Chuxiong Detention Center. Wang Zang was very grateful for their solidarity and support, but after learning that his wife was arrested, he was extremely sad and very worried about the life, studies, and safety of his four children (including two young children). It‚Äôs reported that the authorities accused Wang Zang of inciting subversion of state power for his public remarks, interviews, written poetry articles, and performance art after he was released in 2015.

Wang Zang‚Äôs 4 children are 11-year-old, 8-year-old and 4-year-old twins. Insiders said that due to financial difficulties and other factors, the twins could not go to the kindergarten. The 8-year-old girl is picked up by the police every day to and from school. Moreover, the grandparents were guarded at home by many police, and the local relatives were threatened by the National Security Council not to visit them.

3072,"Get your very own copy of Protecting The President from the WND Superstore: http://superstore.wnd.com/Protecting-the-President-An-Inside-Account-of-the-Troubled-Secret-Service-Hardcover

Being a Secret Service agent is one of the most treacherous jobs in the world and never more so than in today‚Äôs highly polarized America. Facing threats from fence jumpers and manifesto writers, and from fanatical terrorists and sophisticated spies, protecting the president is harder than ever. In an age of hyper-partisan politics, emotions are high and crazies are a dime a dozen. On top of that, with international tensions reaching a boiling point, it‚Äôs harder than ever to determine friend from foe.

Yet the President of the United States is in very real danger if the Secret Service doesn‚Äôt change course soon and evolve with the rapidly changing threat environment. Highly motivated ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù are already working on technologically advanced methodologies and are constantly striving to formulate the logistics of an attack on the White House. Eventually terrorist planners will find a way to acquire the technology, weapons, explosives, and know-how to make an attempt on the life of the President. The only question is ‚ÄúWhat are we going to do about it?‚Äù

Protecting the President provides not only a rare insider glimpse of what the Secret Service does, but explores the challenges facing the agents today. Chock-full of relevant stories of protecting past presidents, veteran agent Dan Bongino explains how the agency can best protect the president today. This book covers how the Secret Service should

Plan for a tactical assault by a terrorist attack team
Prepare to respond to a severe medical emergency
Train to handle a chemical or biological weapon attack
Prepare for an attack using explosives, and
Plan for 9-11 style attacks from the air and fire threats

3079,"A WND TV Message from Founder and CEO of WND, Joseph Farah

""The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come."" Joel 2:31

From the beginning, in Genesis, God declared He specifically created the sun and the moon to be used for signs. These heavenly bodies would be used as signals of coming dramatic historical events when the Creator of the universe would intersect with human history. But how do we unlock the code to interpret the signals?

The key is found in the riveting new book, Blood Moons by Pastor Mark Biltz. In 2007 Pastor Biltz first discovered the correlation between when blood moons fell on feast days and key historical world events. He found the divine link between prophecy, heavenly signs, historical events, and when they intersect.

Throughout history God, the Master Timekeeper, has used the heavenly bodies to communicate to us when significant events will happen.

If you want to understand the timing of the Lord, you have to understand the seasons of the Lord, the feasts of the Lord, and the calendar of the Lord.

What are the feasts days?

What is the difference between the biblical calendar and the one we use today?

Why should you be concerned about eclipses in the sky?

In Blood Moons Pastor Biltz answers these questions and more. He explains the importance of these biblical celebrations and milestones and shows how you too can be aware of the signs of things to come.",1,WorldNetDaily

Truth,"" about several of Barack Obama's most influential, and radical,
influences. Kincaid, the Director of the AIM Center for Investigative
Journalism, and associated with AIM since 1978, brought up these ""taboo""
subjects that the media prefer to ignore. Frank Marshall Davis, Obama's
mentor in Hawaii during his critical teen years, was a member of the
Communist Party, as his FBI files revealed. William Ayers, the
unrepentant terrorist and a founder of The Weather Underground, was
closely associated with Obama in Chicago. Kincaid has been a leader in

3089,"Florida Campus Correspondent Ophelie Jacobson spoke to students about President Trump's recently released agenda for his second term. Jacobson asked students to react to some of the ideas, but told students they were part of Biden's plan. Watch how students react when Jacobson tells students these are in fact Trump's ideas, and how he already has a track record of accomplishing some of his goals. 

FULL STORY: The Trump campaign recently released its agenda for a second term, building off the administration‚Äôs first-term accomplishments. Campus Reform asked students about some of the initiatives listed on the agenda, without telling them they were part of Trump's agenda.

Instead, students were told the agenda was Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's.

The students seemed to like the ideas listed, which included stopping endless wars and bringing our troops home, wiping out global terrorists who threaten to harm Americans and dismantling human trafficking networks. 

‚ÄúThe fight on terrorism has always been important, especially in America. So getting rid of stuff that can harm American lives is perfect,‚Äù one student said after hearing that ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù wanted to wipe out global terrorists.

‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a great initiative. Um, really important, because obviously, human trafficking, especially in South Florida which is where I‚Äôm from, is a huge issue. So from what it sounds like, it sounds like a great idea,‚Äù another student said in response to hearing about dismantling human trafficking networks. 

Some of the students said that these ideas had an influence on whether or not they would vote for Biden in November. 

‚ÄúI mean, I still haven‚Äôt decided yet, but these things all sound great and they‚Äôre definitely making me lean more towards Biden,‚Äù one student said.

Campus Reform then mentioned that this was Trump‚Äôs agenda, not Biden's.

‚ÄúIt surprised me a little bit because I don‚Äôt have the highest opinion of the president at the time, but I think that‚Äôs great,‚Äù one student said in response to learning that the Trump administration allocated more than $400 million to dismantle human trafficking networks. 

‚ÄúI think everyone, including myself, could be a little bit more looking at the policies of the President rather than their character‚Äù another student replied. 

‚ÄúIn this time, not a lot of the good he does is heard. It does help knowing that he is doing these things,‚Äù one student said.

3096,"A powerful documentary about Anita Dittman's remarkable journey of courage, forgiveness and faithfulness from childhood's end to a Holocaust nightmare. She reveals how Germany, her native country, traded liberty for a promise of security. This powerful story is as relevant as it was 70 years ago.

Anita Dittman was just a little girl when the winds of Hitler and Nazism began to blow through Germany.

Abandoned by her father when he realized the price of being associated with a Jewish wife and family, Anita was raised by her mother and came to believe that Jesus was her Messiah at 8 years of age. By the time she was 10, the war had begun.

""Trapped in Hitler's Hell"" is the true account of Holocaust horror, but also of God's miraculous mercy on a young girl who spent her teenage years desperately fighting for survival yet learning to trust in the One she had come to love.",1,WorldNetDaily

-
A man said:
They are moving machines, all of them, line processing machines.
This is the fifth bus.
Five buses are ready to leave.
-
Chinese netizens suspected that the machines and machine parts these people were taking home with them were their severance packages because the factory owner did not have any cash to pay them. 
-
The same videographer came back to the same long-distance bus station to record the crowd returning home to Hubei on the evening of April 28. The video shows more than 1,000 workers board buses to return home every day. The street lights were off this time. He thinks the authorities deliberately turned off the lights to prevent filming, fearing that videos like these will reveal the actual situation of China‚Äôs economy to the public. 
-
It's April 28, and more than 1,000 people are waiting here for a bus to go home. 

The street lights are off at this bus station. As a result, the video is very dark. I can tell you there are over 1,000 people, and they are going back to Hubei Province. So many people are here where I am filming now. Undoubtedly there are more than 1,000. It‚Äôs a huge crowd. 
-
China is hard-hit by the pandemic. The regime tries to cover up reality, but people know the real situation. The epidemic has drastically affected China‚Äôs manufacturing industry. The back-to-work policy is getting nowhere due to the lack of overseas orders and materials.

Magdalena Baltazar, 40, held a sign saying ‚ÄúMexicans love beans‚Äù after hearing that the migrants, from Central America, had been complaining about the food Mexico has offered them.

‚ÄúThey complained that the tacos, the tortillas with beans, are food for animals,‚Äù Baltazar said through a translator. ‚ÄúIt is actually one of the foods that people here in Mexico have at home. How is it possible that immigrants come here to criticize Mexico‚Äôs food?‚Äù

3158,"On this episode of Federalist Radio Hour, actor Dean Cain joins Culture Editor Emily Jashinsky to discuss his role as Peter Strzok in the forthcoming Obamagate movie and the importance of sharing the context behind Strzok and Lisa Page's role in the Obama Administration's Russia Hoax and mishandling of the ""Crossfire Hurricane"" investigation.

""We didn't make anything up,"" Cain explained. ""There's nothing fictionalized. This is just their words and their own words are pretty damning.""

The movie is necessary to put Strzok and Page's arrogance as top FBI agents and their blatant bias against then-presidential candidate Donald Trump on display, Cain explains.

""They have contempt for those below them, which is pretty much everybody else in America. They say it. [Strzok] literally says that about people and voters in the United States... that they are 'f-ng' stupid. That's a quote,"" Cain said.

Cain also explains more behind why the film, which exposes the flaws in parts of the bureaucracy under President Barack Obama, is being produced outside of Hollywood and popular streaming platforms.

""Truth-telling films that challenge the left's narrative often end up with little to no funding,"" the Obamagate movie website states.

""It's a nice little insight into what sort of happens in government and how things get swept under the table, which would really appall the regular folks out there,"" Cain added.

Charl Van Wyk was just an ordinary Christian man until July 25, 1993 - the day that would become known as the St. James Massacre. It was on this date that Van Wyk shot back at the terrorists who were attacking an innocent congregation gathered in prayer, and saved many lives in the process. More than just a remarkable story of courage under fire, Shooting Back deals forthrightly with the consequences of his actions, while addressing the concerns that plague so many God-fearing people in these lawless times, such as: Should we carry arms? When is it appropriate to defend ourselves and our families? What can we do when our God-given right to self-defense is legislated away from us? In Shooting Back, Van Wyk tackles these difficult questions using the light of Scripture and insights from his own experience to make the case for self-defense.",1,WorldNetDaily

3189,"On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Journalist Megyn Kelly joins Ben Domenech to discuss her new podcast ‚ÄúThe Megyn Kelly Show,‚Äù cultural wokeness, and the importance of independent media.

Kelly said her decision to start her own podcast stems from the frustration she felt while working in cable news dictated by agendas and fame.

‚ÄúI think that cable is basically full of pandering and it‚Äôs full of individual fiefdoms now where the anchors war with one another,‚Äù Kelly said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äòs hard to be a really happy person when you‚Äôre living the life of a cable news anchor. It‚Äôs a grueling, 24/7 job where you‚Äôre under attack, all the time, internally and externally. And you may get paid well, but you don‚Äôt see a lot of your family and you wind up, at least in my case, asking yourself, for what? The only way to make your show work in cable news is to be all politics.‚Äù

Kelly said ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù expressed by those on the left hinders the expansion of thought and discussion required for accurate and productive coverage.

‚ÄúPeople today will say ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs a racist message. You‚Äôre not acknowledging the systemic things that are holding people down. Not everybody can do it.‚Äô I don‚Äôt have to believe that‚Äôs true,‚Äù Kelly said. ‚ÄúI think we can get through anything and I think the way of doing it is not to wallow in negativity and look all around yourself for reasons why somebody else is holding you down.‚Äù

According to Kelly, thoughtfulness, cultural discussion, and flexibility are all important and she desires to bring them to audiences around the world by digging into topics other than just ‚Äúthe latest tweet war.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just this fight back and forth to talking heads, it‚Äôs a thoughtful discussion,‚Äù Kelly said.

‚ÄúPeople who want to safe space need to go someplace else,‚Äù Kelly added. ‚ÄúPeople who want thoughtful, provocative conversation and no BS can come to me.‚Äù

Note: This podcast was recorded before President Donald Trump officially nominated Amy Coney Barrett to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg‚Äôs seat on the Supreme Court of The United States.

The U.S. Revokes Over 1,000 Visas of Chinese Nationals Due to Military Links

On Sept. 9, a State Department spokesperson said that the United States has revoked more than 1,000 visas of Chinese nationals over military links.

The Department spokesperson told The Epoch Times in a statement: ‚ÄúWe continue to welcome legitimate students and scholars from China who do not further the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs goals of military dominance.‚Äù 

Starting from June 1, the State Department began implementing a proclamation issued in late May by President Donald Trump. The proclamation was to limit Beijing‚Äôs ability to leverage Chinese graduate students and researchers to steal U.S. technologies, intellectual property, and information to develop advanced military capabilities.


Australian Report Discloses CCP‚Äôs Coercive Diplomacy

The latest report released by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) exposed how the CCP has used ""coercive diplomacy"" in the past decade to force and bully other governments or corporations to comply with it. The report called on every nation to come together to resist the CCP. However, experts believe that decoupling from the CCP is the solution to the problem.

On September 1, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute published a report called ‚ÄúThe Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs Coercive Diplomacy‚Äù in which CCP‚Äôs ‚Äúcoercive diplomacy‚Äù used to suppress every single country in the world for the past decade is detailed. The report has been tracking the CCP‚Äôs use of coercive diplomacy from 2010 to 2019 and recorded 152 cases of coercive diplomacy, with 100 cases targeted foreign governments and 52 cases targeted at certain companies. Taiwan is also affected.

The report mentioned that CCP‚Äôs coercive tactics include economic and non-economic measures. Economic measures can take place in trade sanctions, investment restrictions, tourism bans, and popular boycotts. Non-economic measures can include arbitrary detention, restrictions on official travel, and state-issued threats.


Trump: Ending Dependence on China in the Next Four Years

President Trump held a rally in Winston Salem, North Carolina, on Sept. 8, stating his policy agenda for the next term, including ending dependence on China, promoting the return of enterprises, and strengthening law enforcement. He also reiterated that this election is crucial.

President Trump said: ‚ÄúWhile I‚Äôm President, America will remain the No.1 producer of oil and natural gas on Earth and we will remain energy independent.‚Äù Trump also promised to end U.S. manufacturing's dependence on China.

Trump also accused Biden of allowing the CCP to plunder a large number of American jobs during his 47 years in office and pointed out that if Biden is elected, the United States will face a series of disasters.


Pompeo Tells Southeast Asia to Stand up to China; Shun Its Firms

On September 10, the United States‚Äô top diplomat urged Southeast Asian countries to stand up to maritime bullying by China and to reassess business deals with its state firms, adding to heated exchanges between two powers jostling for influence.

Speaking remotely to foreign ministers of the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the region should be confident in the United States and know it can bank on its support.

ASEAN has said it does not want to take sides amid friction over a recent spike in military activities by both powers in the South China Sea and ahead of a November election in which U.S. President Donald Trump will tout his tough stand against China.

Following the legalization of medical marijuana in California, Mexican cartels pivoted to the production of pure liquid meth, which is brought across the border and crystallized in conversion labs. There is more meth on the streets than ever before, according to William Ruzzamenti, a 30-year Drug Enforcement Administration veteran and the Executive Director of the Central Valley California HIDTA (High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area). It‚Äôs also cheaper‚Äîthe average cost of an ounce of methamphetamine dropped from nearly $968 in 2013 to around $250 in 2016.

‚ÄúI think a lot of people associate meth with the 1990s, and this comeback has gone largely unnoticed in the shadow of the heroin and opioid epidemics,‚Äù Mary Newman, a journalist at the Investigative Reporting Program at UC Berkeley, told The Atlantic.

Newman‚Äôs short documentary focuses on the drug‚Äôs frequently overlooked victims: children. Although no scientific research has been conducted that directly correlates meth addiction to child abuse or neglect, many experts on the subject report a connection that Newman describes as ‚Äústaggering.‚Äù Read more: https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/568381/motherhood-meth/

3194,"Joel Richardson, New York Times bestselling author and teacher, and director of the documentary ""End Times Eyewitness,"" presents a powerful new film, ""Global Jesus Revolution,"" showing how present-day world events, particularly throughout the Middle East, are clearly falling into alignment with the words of the biblical prophets concerning the last days.

But far more important than merely knowing about the end times is knowing what the followers of Jesus should be doing about it. What are the primary issues that the Church must focus on in light of all that is now unfolding throughout the nations?

In ""Global Jesus Revolution,"" Joel Richardson looks out across the Middle East and across the earth. He explores and examines the exponential rise of protests, riots and full-blown political revolutions. Richardson says, ""I am thoroughly convinced that if the Church is to fulfill its primary mandate in these days, then so also do we need a revolution within the Church.""

Messianic rabbi Jonathan Cahn, author of the New York Times bestseller ""The Harbinger,"" says: ‚ÄúIn the world there are all kinds of revolutions throughout history: French revolution, American revolution. Communist revolutions, Islamic revolutions. Of course they never really bring the answer because the (real) issue is sin.""

""Global Jesus Revolution"" reveals that the only proper response to the political revolutions, social upheaval, civil wars and outright chaos unfolding throughout the nations is a much greater spiritual revolution among the disciples of Jesus. Cahn explains: ""You look at the beginning. You have twelve believers and ultimately they change the world. They change, they affect politics, and culture, and world history itself. But it happens through an upper room. It happens through prayer. It happens through the presence of God and it happens through people seeking God.‚Äù

Find out from these leaders how the ""Global Jesus Revolution"" is being manifested across the globe:

Jonathan Cahn, Messianic rabbi and bestselling author of ""The Harbinger,"" emphasizes the importance of the Prayer Movement.
Daniel Lim, Indonesian deacon, explains the prayer towers his church erected to bless the enemy that persecutes them.
Chris Mitchell, CBN Middle East bureau chief talks about the 24-7 houses of prayer around the world that are the ""rudder of history.""
Jesse Digges, missionary to Uganda, describes how the early Church was birthed in continual prayer, and after Pentecost the prayer meeting kept right on going.
Egyptian pastor Dr. Sameh Maurice extols the Christian movement in Egypt and the draw of tens of thousands.
Iranian pastor Ali details the Spirit‚Äôs movement inside Iran with all-night prayer and fasting.
This film is a blueprint, a manifesto for that revolution. It's a revolution called the ""Global Jesus Revolution.""

On July 18, the Chinese minister of water resources instructed local authorities to arrange for dikes to be broken and the rural areas of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi provinces to be submerged. They are prepared to sacrifice the countryside in order to protect the big cities.

The Yangtze River basin is home to roughly 459 million, with 51 percent (234 million) of them living in rural areas.

On July 18, state-run media Xinhua reported that the Three Gorges Dam had received the largest amount of floodwater to date, and that the dam had ‚Äúdisplacement, seepage, and deformation.‚Äù

On July 20, authorities warned northeastern Liaoning, as well as Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Tibet in the south may experience mudslides due to the heavy rain. According to the meteorological center, other areas of northeastern China, Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces, may also have torrential rainfall.

Residents also told The Epoch Times that embankment breaches have caused floodwaters to submerge their hometown villages.

------------------
The Epoch Times interviewed a Wuhan resident trapped at home for 40 days. Aid is not available. With two young children, the money is running out, and the door was nailed shut from outside, despite the fact that they are not infected. The despair is hard to imagine.

In this interview, Wuhan residents are involuntarily faced with a situation worse than a battle zone. Death seems to be the only way it can end, whether its death from the infection, from starvation, or from the tyranny.

3271,"Chinese mask factories are closing down. Many netizens and business owners revealed the reasons: rapid expansion, a huge increase in prices of machinery and raw materials, and the inability to export masks after international requirements became stricter. One netizen commented: ‚ÄúMask factories closed down, Chinese-made masks are worth less than papers, this is the epitome of the bankruptcy of Chinese mask diplomacy!‚Äù

On May 2, a mask factory closed down in Anqing City in Anhui province and a video of the unmarketable masks piling up in the yard has been circulating online. In fact, as early as April 25, netizens exposed that the mask factories in Shenzhen are now closed too.

Anqing City is a base of the medical masks industry. Netizens exposed that a while ago, hundreds of mask factories were established overnight in Tongcheng County of Anqing. So far, more than a thousand mask factories stopped their operations.

An employee of a mask factory, Mr. Li, indicated that after the prices of machinery and raw materials increased and the exporting of masks failed due to strict requirements from the international community on quality, many mask factories have closed down.

 ‚ÄúThe nonwoven fabric, used as the middle layer, now costs more than $700,000 yuan ($99,110 USD) per ton. The cost of manufacturing is high, so they are unable to continue producing.‚Äù

A video dated April 30 on YouTube shows that a mask factory closed down and the employee went to find jobs at another mask factory without success. Many mask factories have stopped hiring. 
-
 ‚ÄúThis was the mask factory I used to work at and now there is nobody, it is closed down for sure.‚Äù
‚ÄúBoss, are you hiring? No? Not hiring. Hmm, many factories stopped their production.‚Äù
‚ÄúBoss, do you need anybody here? Not hiring.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is wrong that everybody went straight ahead to produce facial masks. The real medical facial masks need to be produced in a sterile environment and it is totally irresponsible to sell masks that are produced in regular workshops or in garages. Therefore, some masks are not selling and the production stopped, as a result, factories closed down.‚Äù

At first, China fooled the world with its masks, now that the U.S. became self-sufficient and Taiwan was able to export masks, the pandemic has eased! China's massive production capacity was completely abandoned! The price of greed!‚Äù

On August 19, the Three Gorges Dam opened 10 spillways to lower the flood pressure for the first time since 2003 when the massive dam started operation. On the day before, Sichuan Province issued a Level One Flood Alert, also for the first time in history. Floodwaters reached the feet of Leshan Giant Buddha for the first time in 70 years. 

The fifth flood peak entered the Three Gorges Reservoir on Aug. 19 at a speed of 74,000 cubic meters per second. The Dam opened 10 spillways to discharge the flood, a record high since the opening of the dam.

Four days ago, the dam was just hit by the fourth Flood Peak on Aug. 14.

The fifth flood turned part of Chongqing into a swamp land. Many roads were shut off. 

Water flooded the gate of Chaotianmen Wharf, and shops near the Yangtze river began to evacuate the day before.

By 10 a.m. on Aug. 19, water level at Chaotianmen Wharf exceeded the safety level by 5.69 meters (18.7 feet), and it was still rising.

Leshan City of Sichuan Province is one of the worst-hit cities as three major rivers‚ÄîMin, Qingyi and Dadu Rivers, converge inside the city. After days of torrential rains in the province, water levels at all three rivers kept rising and eventually inundated Leshan City. In some places, floodwaters reached rooftops. 

The 233 ft. high, Leshan Giant Buddha‚Äîthe tallest stone Buddha in the world‚Äîhad its feet covered by water, and the scenic spot was closed. This is the first time since 1949 that the Leshan Giant Buddha has been flooded to its feet. 

The Buddha statue took 90 years to build between 713 and 803 (Tang Dynasty), specifically for the purpose of protecting people from water-related disasters, especially for preventing boats from sinking.  

There is a folklore saying among locals which says, ‚Äútoes in water, flooding to follow.‚Äù It means, when water level covers the Buddha statue‚Äôs toes, the entire province will be severely flooded. 

The flood also caused a road to collapse. During the early morning hours of Aug. 19, the street in front of Yinlong Square in Yibin City suddenly collapsed to form a huge pit, swallowing 21 cars instantly.

On the same day, a man in Deyang City was washed away when filming the floods on the river bank of Min River.

-
The ""Zhongda Cloth Market"" in Guangzhou is mainly a distribution center for various fabrics, yarn, and garments. Thousands of large and small factories gather nearby. For more than a decade, almost the entire 150,000 non-native population in this region have made a living by making clothes and processing accessories. When the business is good, their monthly income can exceed $10,000 yuan ($1,400 USD). Last year, however, orders were greatly reduced in the aftermath of the Sino-U.S. trade war. In the beginning of the year, due to the CCP virus outbreak, the manufacturers lost all their business.

On April 21 and 22, thousands of garment factory owners and merchants joined the march at the exit of the subway station near the market, shouting ""reduce rent, reduce rent"" along the way. They demanded government intervention to reduce their rents after they had no income for three months since February. Police cars arrived at the scene and policemen came to block the road. Conflicts continue to break out.
-
Scenario 1: (The parading owners hold small signs that read ""Reduce Rent"") Reduce rent. Reduce rent.
Scene 2: (Police besieged the crowd) Many people: The police are beating people.
Scenario 3: The police put up barricades hand in hand, and demanded for owners to stand against a wall before the police car arrived at the scene.

3307,"According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, America is facing its biggest migrant surge in 20 years. The Mexican president recently blamed the surge of migrants to the Southern Border on the Biden administration. 

However, President Joe Biden has repeatedly shifted the blame for the border crisis to the Trump administration, despite encouraging illegal immigrants to ""immediately surge to the border"" should he become president, during the first Democratic Primary Debate.

With recent news reports and coverage focused on the crisis at the border, Campus Reform went to the University of Florida to ask students who they think is to blame: Biden or Trump?

The majority of students were quick to blame the Trump Administration for the border crisis. But when Campus Reform informed the students of what Biden said during his campaign, many began to rethink their opinions and several didn‚Äôt seem to agree with Biden‚Äôs plan to provide free healthcare to illegal immigrants.

Watch the full video above to see how students changed their minds when presented with the facts.

Amid a severe food crisis, Xi Jinping called for strict legislation to stop food waste. The National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration also announced an annual decrease of 9.388 million tons in wheat acquisition. However, on August 19, the National Bureau of Statistics of China published statistics claiming that this year‚Äôs rice production increased by 1.028 million tons in comparison to last year. This aroused public criticism.

On August 19, the National Bureau of Statistics of China released the early rice production data for 2020, claiming that the total production was 27.29 million tons this year, with an increase of 1.028 million tons. This represented a growth of 3.9 percent, reversing the situation of seven consecutive years of decline. Nevertheless, an agricultural researcher in Jiangxi, who did not wish to reveal his name, questioned the validity of the data. He asked how the production of crops increased when China has been suffering from the plague, heavy floods, and locust outbreaks continuously this year? 

Jiangxi expressed that they never believe in the official statistics and only believe in what they see. For instance, the local flour factory used to have hundreds of trucks delivering wheat, but not anymore. 

On the same day when the National Bureau of Statistics announced an increase in rice, the CCP authorities released information about food shortage. In an online video conference held on August 19, Hu Chunhua, the vice premier of China, called for a rapid organization of farmers to strengthen the recovery of agricultural production after disasters. He called to strengthen the prevention and control of pests and diseases such as moths and to closely monitor meteorological disasters such as typhoons, floods, and droughts.

Mr. Li from Henan indicated that the government deceives everything, hurting the people. When people are out of food, all measures of maintaining stability of the government will become ineffective. However, even as the food crisis threatens China, the CCP is still giving away large amounts of food. A Twitter account, DynastyEndChaos, posted a video where the CCP assisted Africa with 30,000 tons of rice which was packed onto a ship on August 18.

In addition China News reported that on August 13, the government of Inner Mongolia donated 163 tons of rice to Russia. Chinese independent scholar, Ge Bidong, pointed out that this is exactly like the time of Mao Zedong. In the previous century, during the Great Leap Forward, the CCP‚Äôs political movements created a great famine that caused the death of tens of millions of peasants. When these peasants were dying from hunger, the CCP went so far as to snatch food from the starving people and give it to third-world countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America in order to promote its international communism. He reminded the Chinese people that the CCP is careless about the lives of the people, so they need to store some food in preparation for the crisis.

With ISIS metastasizing into more than two dozen countries, a massive refugee crisis threatening to negatively impact America much the same way it has decimated Europe, and increasing numbers of homegrown terrorists, radicalized into embracing jihad, within our own borders, Muslim Mafia is the book you need in order to understand what is really happening to America.

Muslim Mafia is the sensational result of a six-month undercover penetration of the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations that resulted in the collection of thousands of pages of smoking-gun documents from this terror-linked front group for the dangerous, mob-like Muslim Brotherhood.

Muslim Mafia delivers all the elements of a top-flight mystery novel, except that the situations and conversations are totally real. The book's frightening allegations are supported by more than 12,000 pages of confidential CAIR documents and hundreds of hours of video captured in an unprecedented undercover operation. This trail of information reveals the seditious and well-funded efforts of the Brotherhood under the nonprofit guise of CAIR to support the international jihad movement against the United States. Posing as an intern, Chris Gaubatz courageously gains the trust of CAIR's inner sanctum, working undercover while posing as a devoted convert to Islam, and blows the whistle on the entire factory fueling the wave of homegrown terrorism now plaguing America.

Major cities in Heilongjiang Province can no longer hide the emergence of the second wave of the CCP virus. Harbin and Mudanjiang both placed communities under lockdown. As a result, restaurants have few customers and nearly half have already shut down. 

However, there are hardly any other job opportunities for these restaurant owners because Heilongjiang residents are considered a higher risk group for the CCP virus and they will be turned away if they try to seek jobs in other provinces.  
Mr. Bao is the owner of a restaurant in Mudanjiang.

Or, did He come to fulfill that which all of the Hebrew prophets had foretold since the fall of man‚Äîsomething the Holy Scriptures mysteriously and wonderfully call ""the restitution of all things.""

Could you on this day whisper in her ear that someone loves her very much and more and more each day? ... then tell her if she wants to know who that ""someone"" is to just turn her head to the left.

There is an invisible war raging in the world. Not a war fought with bullets and guns, but a war of manipulation.

It‚Äôs a war fought by China‚Äôs Communist Party (CCP) against the free world using the full force of its propaganda and influence apparatus.

Not only does the CCP actively spread its propaganda to the West, but it has also even succeeded in dictating what can and cannot be said in free societies. 

However, this influence has gone largely unnoticed. And by now, it has penetrated all levels of American society. 

In this new age of information warfare, where a hostile foreign power is waging a war for our minds, what can be done?

In this in-depth-report, we explore China's ""Grand External Propaganda"" campaign against America and the rest of the free world and reveal the playbook it uses.

------------------
Location: Wuhan, Hubei, China

Upon the severe economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic, the communist regime demands that the nation return to work while it continues its lockdown policy. From March 1, the regime imposed an unprecedented internet blockage. Many Wuhan residents have not been able to get help for the past 40 days, and it continues. 

The Epoch Times interviewed a Wuhan resident trapped at home for 40 days. Aid is not available. With two young children, money running out, door nailed shut from outside, even though they are not infected. The despair is hard to imagine.
-
Mr. Pan: Basically, my savings are almost used up. I have to find someone to borrow money from when it's gone. The food is so expensive. I can‚Äôt even go out to beg in the street. No one is on the street! 

Journalist: You can't go out, right?

Mr. Pan: Right. The door is nailed shut completely.

Journalist: Do they deliver the groceries?

Mr. Pan: There are two separate issues. The first one is that food is quite expensive. Second, where does money or finance come from? There‚Äôs no money. Who can afford it? Who would sell to you? The third one, go begging. I was ready to beg for food, I would take my family out to beg for food. But how? I can't even go out.

Mr. Pan: I am not ill. I have made it clear.  My dad is infected. Not me, I am normal. Why can't I have the right to live? Who can tell me? I'm in the house every day now. What can I do? Wait for death?

Journalist: This is inhumane to trap people at home.

Mr. Pan: This is the situation now. Has anyone called me and asked after me? No one cares about us. I haven't seen one grain of rice from relief aid, let alone anything else. What donations? What disaster relief? Nothing! I have two children and we have not received even a grain of rice!

Journalist: How can people live like that?

Mr. Pan: It is not just me, I have asked around, it‚Äôs the same for everyone else. No one has received a grain of rice. So what is the government doing? Today is the 40th day, and it will be another forty days.

Is the epidemic still so serious that it has to be closed for another 40 days?

Mr. Pan: I don‚Äôt know. No one has reported about the epidemic. If the epidemic was not serious, the door would be open! The logic is very simple. Open the door, let everyone out to live a normal life? Nail up the door! doesn't that mean it is still very serious now. What's there to ask?

Journalist: The power will be off automatically without money?

Mr. Pan: Yes, of course. It's bundled with my mobile phone, it deducts automatically. If you don't believe me, I can show you the phone. My life is really difficult now, what can I do if my 3-year old girl is out of baby formula?

Journalist: If it continues, the common people's life is....

Mr. Pan: I think I am an individual. People is a derogatory term. I am not just a person. I am an individual. My last name is MPan. My son and daughter are also surnamed  MPan. I have a name. How can I just be a common person? Everyone has a first name, right? This Is the Way.

Journalist: This is a very common situation there?

Mr. Pan: My father has not received anything either, nor have my in-laws. My family and relatives have nothing, neither my brothers and sisters‚Äîall have nothing. If anyone had received a grain of rice, they would tell me.

Journalist: Where are those donated supplies?

Mr. Pan: Ask Heaven, how would I know? (So many donations from various places.) There are about 17 or 18 people in my family. We speak on the phone‚Äîno one has received any so-called donated materials. They didn't even get a grain of rice. My father has coronary heart disease and high blood pressure. He can‚Äôt go out. He can‚Äôt stay in the hospital. What kind of society is this!

Journalist: It was said to introduce some policy?

Mr. Pan: Since the lockdown began I have not received a grain of rice. I made a lot of phone calls, they were all recorded. This is my situation now. Who can I complain to? If I scold this party and this government, I would go to jail, to put it seriously, they could say that I overturned the state power, what could I do then?

Journalist: You can't even afford the rice, how could you overturn the state?

Mr. Pan: I am an individual. I have children, I have a family, and I have parents. What should I do? In other words, there are both elderlies and youngsters at home.

Journalist: Right, there are so many people like you now. You have to wait until the end of April?

Mr. Pan: This society is not human, it is hell. We are boiled in hell, waiting for trial, or waiting for the fire to burn us, just to die. We are very scared, because the coronavirus is ubiquitous. Getting infected is very troublesome.

Firing pepper pellets and clearing out protesters‚ÄîHong Kong authorities arrested more than 200 people during pro-democracy protests after a sing-along demonstration at a shopping mall.

Hundreds of riot police were deployed to disperse protesters across the city last Sunday, as protesters chanted for freedom and held up banners calling for a revolution. It's one of the first signs of civil unrest returning to Hong Kong which has largely been put on hold since January under social distancing restrictions.

How does he know? Not only did he deal with it both as a journalist and an intelligence officer for Texas‚Äô government, he just took a trip there and interviewed the actual migrants! It turns out we are not properly vetting them and have no idea who these people are before they swim across the river or are admitted into the country with limited vetting.

For reasons that escape logic, protesters and activists are still being asked the same question by reporters and those who refuse to come to terms with America‚Äôs history of racism: Why are you here? How do you feel about the looting?

It‚Äôs a series of questions too often forced upon black people who are expected to educate the masses while simultaneously being oppressed, murdered, ignored, and told to be quiet and ‚Äúget over‚Äù hundreds of years of institutionalized racism. Why can‚Äôt you protest this way or that way? Why can‚Äôt you do the thing that makes other people comfortable with your anger? As if a basic understanding of American history isn‚Äôt more than enough as a starting point to answer these questions.

One woman, who was stopped by a NY1 News reporter outside of Brooklyn‚Äôs Barclays Center during a protest Tuesday, not only answered those questions but posed one herself: What did people think was going to happen?

3602,"A government-funded job training program that promised to turn hundreds of residents of Kentucky‚Äôs coal country into computer coders so far has spent $2 million to place 17 people in tech jobs and may have left others worse off, The Daily Signal has learned.
 
The program, a private-public partnership between state and federal agencies and Interapt, a Louisville-based software development company, is a product of President Barack Obama‚Äôs TechHire Initiative of 2015.
 
The job training program, budgeted for a total of $4.5 million, was supposed to last through 2019 and train up to 200 people from an economically depressed region of Kentucky for middle- to high-skill careers in information technology.
 
The program paid interns $400 a week to learn how to write software code, and Interapt promised high-paying jobs to those who successfully completed it.
 
But less than a year later, workers have torn down signs at Big Sandy Community and Technical College, where the program was based, and are closing shop on what appears to be a government-funded program run amok.
 
Watch the video to learn more about how this multi-million-dollar government program let an entire town down, and what they learned from it.

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

On July 23, at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in California, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo implored democracies to work together to defend against expansive threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), calling it a choice between ‚Äúfreedom and tyranny‚Äù in his speech on communist China.

Pompeo said that in the more than four decades since the United States normalized relations with the CCP, China has not liberalized as many had hoped. 

People and countries ‚Äúhave to tell the truth‚Äù about the CCP: ‚ÄúPresident Nixon once said he feared he had created a Frankenstein by opening the world to the CCP. And here we are. We can‚Äôt treat this incarnation of China as a normal country just like any other.‚Äù

Located in Koh Phangan, Thailand, it is a tropical, paradise-like community focused on nurturing mental and physical health, or as Agama‚Äôs website puts it, the ‚Äúsecret spiritual path of true Integral Yoga courses.‚Äù

But some Agama students say that what they found there was the opposite after interacting with Agama‚Äôs founder, Swami Vivekananda Saraswati, a Romanian national who is accused of sexual assault of 14 of his students, as reported by the Guardian. (Agama and the Swami deny the allegations.)

3649,"Ronald Mallett, a theoretical physicist and professor emeritus of physics at the University of Connecticut, claims to have the solution to time travel.

‚ÄúI actually solved Einstein‚Äôs gravitational field equation,‚Äù Mallett told The Root. His work has been recognized globally and widely acknowledged by the scientific community. This discovery, and the road to it, has been well documented in numerous interviews, documentaries and Ron‚Äôs own book, The Time Traveler.

‚ÄúMy solutions to his equations showed that a circulating beam of light will actually cause space and time to become twisted,‚Äù says Mallett. ‚ÄúEventually that twisting of space, if it was great enough, might lead to a twisting of time into a loop that could allow the possibility of time travel or sending information back into the past. And that was my breakthrough.‚Äù

3664,"It was a forgone conclusion that Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) was gearing up for mass revolt against the evil humans, but in ‚ÄúAbsence of Field,‚Äù the third episode of Westworld‚Äôs third season, she states it explicitly, telling new friend Caleb Nichols (Aaron Paul) that she‚Äôs ready to enact a full-blown revolution and wants him to be by her side for it. Of course, she basically ruins his life first, informing him that Rehoboam‚Äîa real-life algorithm running out of a computer system encased in a giant eye‚Äî is controlling all humans‚Äô futures, and has predicted that he is very likely to take his own life on a sad pier in 10-12 years. (Or is he a cyborg? He does have that army-issued implant in the roof of his mouth, a technology whose purpose seems dubious at best.)

‚ÄúAbsence of Field‚Äù was a fascinating episode, and Dolores has clearly been making good use of her time off the Westworld island. We learn that Charlotte Hale (Tessa Thompson) very likely croaked in the massacre, but fortunately, Dolores crafted her a host double‚Äîwhich host is inhabiting her body, though, is a mystery for another episode‚ÄîTeddy? Wyatt? Armistice? Clementine?‚Äîbut Charlotte‚Äôs son Nathan is good motivation for getting back into predator mode after she murks out a pedophile and steals his dog for her son.

3698,"According to Joyner Lucas, there are two sides to every story. 

In his breakout song, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Not Racist,‚Äù the rapper attempts to start a discussion on how we approach racial differences, assisted by actors who portray the white and black characters who each own half of this two-verse track.

But the black character in his viral music video fails to put bigotry and harmful stereotypes in their place. 

And we weren‚Äôt the only ones who felt that way. New York rappers Mysonne and Osyris Antham join us to break down their remixed versions of the second verse and why they felt it necessary to step to the mic.

3708,"Ayanna Pressley loves playing with her hair. Before she became a Massachusetts Congresswoman (and a high-profile member of ‚ÄúThe Squad‚Äù), Pressley would experiment with different hairstyles and textures, getting a weave and even cutting her own hair. Lately, she‚Äôs been experimenting with lace-front wigs.

‚ÄúOne I call ‚ÄòFLOTUS‚Äô because it feels very Michelle Obama to me, [and another] I call ‚ÄòTracee,‚Äô because it feels very Tracee Ellis Ross to me,‚Äù Pressley told me in an exclusive interview with The Root earlier this week.

But the wigs are a noticeable departure from her signature Senegalese and bomb twists, which have become synonymous with her political brand and made her the hero of little black girls across the country. Now, the congresswoman has decided to go public as to her reason why: She has alopecia.

3717,"In Jezebel‚Äôs newest series Rummaging Through the Attic, we interview nonfiction authors whose books explore fascinating moments, characters, and stories in history. For our first episode we spoke with Kristen Richardson, author of The Season: A Social History of the Debutante, a nonfiction work that explores the history of the debutante in society.

For some, the fascination with debutantes began with works like Jane Austen‚Äôs seminal romance Pride and Prejudice, which is set in turn of the 19th century England and depicts the pressures placed upon women of that era to secure a financially prosperous marriage for the good of their family‚Äîan effort that involved ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù to society at balls and dances filled (hopefully) with wealthy suitors.

For others, they were actually debutantes themselves, having once partaken in the coming-of-age ritual that‚Äôs still tradition for many high-society families. Author Kristen Richardson almost fell into the latter group at the behest of a relative, but chose at the last minute not to debut: ‚ÄúI was pretty shy. There was no way,‚Äù she recalls. Inevitably, however, she found herself drawn towards the debutante world. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been really interested in weird rituals of social class,‚Äù Richardson admits. ‚ÄúI grew up in-between one family that was working class, my mother‚Äôs side of the family, and then my father‚Äôs is sort of upper-class WASP.‚Äù

3774,"‚ÄúHow many parents ‚Ä¶ send their children to school so central planners can mold them into functionally illiterate cogs in a centrally planned machine, having just enough knowledge to do their preassigned task? How will such cogs be able to think critically, much less sustain liberty and the American experiment? The short answer is that they will not ‚Äì and that is the point.‚Äù ‚Äì The Authors

Utopian dictators like Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot and Mao are criminals ‚Äì genocidal psychopaths who have killed more human beings in the last hundred years than any other ideologues in history. They don't limit their murder to individuals, but to entire nations.

In the United States another form of utopians, the ""progressives,"" have tried to destroy traditional America by strategically dumbing down her people. America's future is being crippled on purpose in order to fundamentally transform the nation, its values and its system of government. Laid out a century ago by progressive luminary John Dewey, the fruits of his schemes are plain to see today. Dewey got rid of the traditional intensive phonics method of instruction and imposed a ""look-say,"" ""sight"" or ""whole-word"" method that forces children to read English as if it were Chinese. The method is widely used in today's public schools, which is a major reason there are so many failing public schools that cannot teach children the basics. This can only be considered a blatant form of child abuse.

American author and veteran educator Samuel Blumenfeld and journalist Alex Newman have taken on the public education establishment as never before and exposed it for the de facto criminal enterprise it is.

""Crimes of the Educators"" reveals how the architects of America's public school disaster implemented a plan to socialize the United States by knowingly and willingly dumbing down the population, a mission now closer to success than ever as the Obama administration works relentlessly to nationalize K-12 schooling with Common Core.

The whole-word method of teaching children to read ‚Äì introduced by John Dewey and colleagues in the early 20th century and which permeates Common Core ‚Äì is a significant cause of dyslexia among students. Public education's war against religion, the ""great American math disaster,"" promotion of death education and the government's plan to lower standards for all so that ""no one is left behind"" are destroying the logic, reasoning and overall educational prowess of America's next generation.

According to the Program for International Student Assessment, which collects test results from 65 countries for its rankings:

In reading, students in 19 other locales scored higher than U.S. students
In science, 22 education systems scored above the U.S.
In mathematics, 29 nations and other jurisdictions outperformed the United States
Journalist Henry Mencken said it best in 1924 when he wrote that the aim of public education is ""to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and originality.""

It is time to hold the Department of Education accountable for the crimes of the educators.

About the Authors

Samuel L. Blumenfeld authored eight books on education, including: ""Is Public Education Necessary?"" ""NEA: Trojan Horse in American Education,"" ""The Whole Language/OBE Fraud"" and ""Homeschooling: A Parent's Guide to Teaching Children.""

Alex Newman is an international journalist, educator and consultant who is currently based in Europe but has lived on four continents. He has a degree in journalism from the University of Florida and has worked for numerous publications in the U.S. and abroad.

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

3837,"""William Murray provides a unique perspective that should be read, particularly by America's youth, at a time central planners are once again promising utopian dreams at a cost to the most productive among us.‚Äù ‚ÄîGovernor Mike Huckabee

Utopian dreamers are deceived and deceiving. Their ‚Äúfight for the people‚Äù rhetoric may sound good at first, but history proves egalitarian governments, and the cultures they try to create, destroy freedom, destroy creativity, destroy human lives, create poverty and misery, and often spread beyond their borders to bring others under slavery. Utopians believe that through their own personal brilliance a better society can be created on earth. When the belief in man as a creation in the image of God is completely rejected, the use of slavery and mass execution can be justified in the name of the creation of a utopian state for the masses. Pol Pot, Vladimir Lenin, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao Tse-tung‚Äîtogether these so-called visionaries through their fanciful policies are responsible for the deaths of millions of people.

In Utopian Road to Hell, William J. Murray, son of atheist apologist Madalyn Murray O‚ÄôHair, describes the totalitarians throughout history and the current utopians who are determined to engage in social engineering to control the life of every person on earth. From Marx to Hitler, Murray explains the progression of socialist engineering from its occultist roots to the extreme madness of the Nazis‚Äô nationalistic racism. From Margaret Sanger‚Äôs Planned Parenthood and Saul Alinsky‚Äôs Rules for Radicals, the rebellious desire to be free from morality drives the ‚Äúat-any-cost‚Äù campaigns such as abortion on demand, no-fault divorce, same-sex marriage and overreaching government provisions. From Woodrow Wilson‚Äôs ‚Äúliving document‚Äù distortion of the Constitution and his income tax, to FDR‚Äôs New Deal, to Obama‚Äôs executive orders, those who seek centralized power typically do so by proclaiming some utopian scheme that they claim will perfect mankind and eliminate competition, greed, poverty and war.

William J. Murray masterfully educates us on the utopians‚Äô swath of destruction throughout history and warns us of the dangers of present-day utopians fighting to hold power. We must heed the warning of George Washington when he said in his 1796 Farewell Address that it is important for those entrusted with the administration of this great and free nation, ‚Äúto confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another.‚Äù We must reclaim the freedom of the individual to avoid the continued path down the utopian road to hell.

 About the Author

William J. Murray is the chairman of the Religious Freedom Coalition in Washington, D.C. For more than three decades he has been at the forefront of social conservatism. He has appeared on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News, and authored hundreds of columns which have appeared online and in print. Author of eight books, Murray continues to work for the rights of Christians in America and persecuted Christians around the world.

3843,"More celebrities and Hollywood dealmakers caught on hidden camera accepting money from ""Middle Eastern oil interests""

HOLLYWOOD, CA -- June 5, 2014 - In a blockbuster new video, Project Veritas exposes more of the darker side of how Hollywood funds its anti-fracking propaganda.

New York Times Bestselling Author and investigative filmmaker, James O'Keefe, released the second part of ""Expos√©: Hollywood's War on U.S. Energy.""

The much-anticipated sequel includes a cameo appearance from Oscar-winning actress and outspoken activist Susan Sarandon, and features Chris Talbott, a 20-year member of Sarandon's team and a Documentary Fellow of the Sundance Film Program.

In the video, three undercover video journalists posing as ""Muhammed"" (the Middle Eastern oil baron), ""Brandon,"" and ""Steven"" (the advertising executives) meet with Sarandon. Sarandon refers ""Muhammed"" to Chris Talbott, her Activism Manager and one of the producers of her Oscar-winning film ""Dead Man Walking.""

With the introduction made by Sarandon, the video journalists posing as ""Muhammed"" and ""Steven"" meet with Talbott a week later. The meeting was caught on tape. Talbott confirms to ""Muhammed"" that he ""told Susan we were meeting today"" and that he ""speaks with Susan or her assistant every day.""

Once again, similar to the investigative report of Academy Awards Governor Ed Begley Jr., Actress Mariel Hemingway, and Environmental Filmmaker Josh Tickell, the offer is made for millions of funding for an environmental documentary aimed at ending domestic natural gas production in the US.

Once again, ""Muhammed"" seemingly finds a willing recipient of the money -- even after clearly stating that his goal is to use environmentalist propaganda to undermine fracking and destroy American energy independence. The stated motive: Profit for his family's oil empire.

Project Veritas founder and president, James O'Keefe, stated Wednesday:

""This latest investigation proves that the Tickell-Begley-Hemingway deal-making was not an isolated incident. The Hollywood environmentalist left is willing to take money from explicitly anti-American interests to fund their movies. The American people deserve to know the truth about how movies are made and the lengths Hollywood will go to undermine American energy independence and national security.""

O'Keefe noted: ""Of course, the best film franchises are usually trilogies.""

The holy month of Ramadan, which is usually marked by fasting, prayer, and attending mosque, social and other religious gatherings between families and friends to break fast continues through May 23rd. Practicing Ramadan during the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 will present unique challenges during a time when many religious spaces are closed for safety and social gatherings are banned in countries across the globe.

We gathered a few prominent black Muslims, including Indiana Congressman Andr√© Carson, to shed light on their beloved Ramadan traditions and how these practices will or will not be altered by the coronavirus pandemic. Watch above.

Foreign Minister of China, Wang Yi, recently tried to release more ‚Äúpositive energy‚Äù in an open speech emphasizing that China has no intention of challenging or replacing the U.S. and urging both nations to talk to each other and to return to the right track. Experts believe that Wang Yi‚Äôs sudden change of attitude and show of weakness explain that the United States has hit the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) where it hurts.

In response to Wang‚Äôs remarks, Taiwan-based senior political commentator Lin Bao-Hua believes that the United States‚Äô move to counter China‚Äôs tech ambitions has really hit the nail on the head. Last month, U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill to boost the United States‚Äô production and development of semiconductors.

China is heavily reliant on foreign imports for semiconductors. According to a report by U.S. trade body Semiconductor Industry Association, the United States currently has a great lead over China in terms of market dominance and technical advancements, despite the latter‚Äôs attempts to boost its semiconductor industry through state-backed policies.

The U.S. government officials did not respond to Wang Yi‚Äôs remarks. Quite the opposite, after a few hours of Wang‚Äôs speech, the United States sanctioned Chen Quanguo, the Party secretary of the Xinjiang region, along with 3 other CCP officials using The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act to freeze their assets and ban their entry to the U.S.

While other museums may include slavery in their exhibits, the Whitney Plantation is the first of its kind to focus primarily on the institution. John Cummings, a 78-year-old white southerner, has spent 16 years and more than $8 million of his own fortune to build the project, which opened in December of last year. 
 
Cummings, a successful trial attorney, developed the museum with the help of his full-time director of research, Ibrahima Seck. The duo hope to educate people on the realities of slavery in its time and its impact in the United States today. ‚ÄúThe history of this country is rooted in slavery,"" says Seck. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt understand the source of the problem, how can you solve it?‚Äù

This is in stark contrast to the government of the Western democracies who, despite various difficulties, sent planes to pick up their own nationals.

On July 12, the Water Resource Bureau in Hukou county issued an emergency collection announcement. It said that due to the current critical flood situation in the county, emergency materials are in shortage and the local government is in need of woven bags.

This announcement sparked outrage among netizens. Many believe that local governments have developed a habit of asking anything they need from their citizens, and this trend started with the local authorities in Wuhan city, the epicenter of the first CCP virus outbreak in December last year. Netizens said that local authorities call on the people to respond to the floods and to do all sorts of other work. And on top of that, the people still pay taxes but receive no support from the government when they really need it most.

NBC News reported Tuesday afternoon that The Federalist, along with the website ZeroHedge were each banned from profiting off Google ads after the network‚Äôs ‚ÄúVerification Unit‚Äù compiled a report with the United Kingdom‚Äôs ‚ÄúCenter for Countering Digital Hate‚Äù complaining about Federalist reporting that exposed legacy media lies about the ongoing social unrest engulfing the two nations. While NBC omitted which articles it submitted to Google that they claim

‚ÄúFor the most part, the mainstream media doesn‚Äôt want to be criticized and they‚Äôre not interested really in free speech or the free exchange of ideas,‚Äù Davidson said on Fox News with Laura Ingraham.

3993,"Order your copy of Debunking Utopia here: http://superstore.wnd.com/Debunking-Utopia-Exposing-the-Myth-of-Nordic-Socialism-Paperback-Autographed

Left-leaning academics, liberal pop stars such as Bruce Springsteen, and Democrat politicians from Bernie Sanders to Bill and Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama all have one thing in common: they are avid admirers of Nordic-style social democracy. The reason is simple. At first glance, Nordic countries seem to have everything liberals want to see in America: equal income distribution, good health, low levels of poverty, and thriving economies, all co-existing with big welfare states. By copying Nordic policies, many in the American left hope to transform America to a similar socialist ""utopia.""

In Debunking Utopia, Swedish author Nima Sanandaji explains why this is all wishful thinking. Certainly, some aspects of Nordic welfare states, such as childcare provision, merit the admiration of liberals. But overall, it is a unique culture based on hard work, healthy diets, social cohesion and high levels of trust that have made Nordic countries successful. Sanandaji explains how the Nordic people adopted this culture of success in order to survive in the unforgiving Scandinavian climate. He systematically proves that the high levels of income equality, high lifespans and other signs of social success in the Nordics all predate the expansion of the welfare state. If anything, the Nordic countries reached their peak during the mid-twentieth century, when they had low taxes and small welfare states. Perhaps most astonishing are his findings that Nordic-Americans consistently outperform their cousins who live across the ocean. People of Nordic descent who live under the American capitalist system not only enjoy higher levels of income, but also a lower level of poverty than the citizens of the Nordic countries themselves.

Background: Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, is where the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) originated from. Social media users in Hubei Province reported numerous sightings of unusual animal behaviors during the coronavirus outbreak, and want to know why such things are happening.

Someone provided a possible answer as to why large numbers of crows were observed in Hubei. 

‚ÄúThe crow is a carrion-eater. The elderly say that crows seem to anticipate death because they can smell it, even before a person dies. In other words, they can smell the odor of a dying person; but we humans cannot,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThey will then circle around this person waiting for him to die.

Leshan is one of the hardest hit cities in Sichuan Province as floods wreaked havoc for weeks. Then, a chemical accident occurred on Aug. 20. Thick smoke surrounded the chemical plant, emitting a strong odor. Residents suspect it was a chlorine leak.

Local authorities confirmed that there was an accident, but emphasized that ‚Äúthe leak is now under control and there was no explosion.‚Äù

Thousands of residents poured out of the city, by car or motorcycle, filling the streets and causing serious traffic jams.

One Chinese person who posted a video of the evacuation on Twitter lamented, ‚ÄúWhat a life‚Äîdie from either drowning in the floods or from toxic gas.‚Äù

Locals are outraged at how officials handled the accident. One person said, ‚ÄúWhen residents reported a chemical leak that was likely chlorine, the official propaganda emphasized the fact that there was no explosion and asked everyone not to spread or believe any rumors. When human lives are in danger, you play word games to downplay the severity. Your country‚Äôs emergency handling is always totally incompetent.‚Äù

Chinese netizens often use ‚Äúyour country‚Äù when criticizing the Chinese regime, to show their strong disapproval of the corrupt system.

4047,"One day after a prominent U.S. Muslim leader reacted to the November 2015 Paris attacks with a declaration that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has nothing to do with Islam, President Obama made the same assertion.

Who exactly is the enemy we face, not only in the Middle East but also within our borders? Is it ""murderers without a coherent creed"" or ""nihilistic killers who want to tear things down,"" as some described ISIS after 130 people were brutally slain and another 368 injured in a coordinated attack on Western soil that authorities say was organized with help from inside France's Muslim communities.

After the Paris attacks, Obama, himself, described ISIS as ""simply a network of killers who are brutalizing local populations.""

But how much do words and definitions really matter? According to the legendary military strategist Sun Tzu, if ""you do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one (battle) and lose one; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.""

When the Department of Homeland Security was founded in 2003, its stated purpose was ""preventing terrorist attacks within the United States and reducing America's vulnerability to terrorism."" The Bush administration's definition of the enemy as a tactic, terrorism, rather than a specific movement, proved consequential amid a culture of political correctness. By the time President Obama took office, Muslim Brotherhood-linked leaders in the United States were forcing changes to national security policy and even being invited into the highest chambers of influence. A policy known as Countering Violent Extremism emerged, downplaying the threat of supremacist Islam as unrelated to the religion and just one among many violent ideological movements.

When recently retired DHS frontline officer and intelligence expert Philip Haney bravely tried to say something about the people and organizations that threatened the nation, his intelligence information was eliminated, and he was investigated by the very agency assigned to protect the country. The national campaign by the DHS to raise public awareness of terrorism and terrorism-related crime known as If You See Something, Say Something effectively has become If You See Something, Say Nothing.

In ""See Something, Say Nothing,"" Haney ‚Äì a charter member of DHS with previous experience in the Middle East ‚Äì and co-author Art Moore expose just how deeply the submission, denial and deception run. Haney's insider, eyewitness account, supported by internal memos and documents, exposes a federal government capitulating to an enemy within and punishing those who reject its narrative.

Haney discloses:

How the Bush administration stripped him and other frontline officers of their ability to define the threat;
How much the Obama administration knew in advance of the Boston Marathon bombing and how it launched an ongoing cover-up on behalf of a major ally;
The administration‚Äôs stealth policy to protect Islamic leaders with supremacist beliefs and violent-jihadist ties, allowing them to freely travel between the U.S. and the Middle East;
The scope of access to the White House and the classified information the Obama administration gave to members of Muslim Brotherhood front groups;
The damning intelligence on Muslim Brotherhood-linked leaders invited to sit at the table and help form national-security policy;
The ""words matter"" memo imposing the demands of radical U.S. Muslims leaders on the DHS, including stripping intelligence and official communications of any mention of Islam in association with terrorism;
The purging of training material that casts Islam in a negative light;
The erasing and altering of vital intelligence on terrorists and terror threats;
The fear-based tactics imposed by the Muslim Brotherhood front groups in the U.S. and their accomplices that paralyze officials, members of Congress and any Department of Homeland Security employee who dares to expose or resist their agenda; and
Much more ‚Ä¶
In this well-documented, first-person account of his unique service with DHS, Haney shows why it's imperative that Americans demand that when they see something and say something, the servants under their charge do something to prevent a cunning, relentless enemy from carrying out its stated aim to ""destroy Western Civilization from within.""

On September 21, federal prosecutors said that a New York City police officer and U.S. Army Reserve member has been arrested on federal charges of acting as an illegal agent for the Chinese regime.

According to a criminal complaint, Baimadajie Angwang, a 33-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen born in China‚Äôs Tibet region, fed intelligence about other ethnic Tibetans in New York to the Chinese Consulate in the city.

Angwang was charged with acting as an agent for China, committing wire fraud, making false statements, and obstructing an official proceeding. He faces up to 55 years imprisonment if convicted of all charges.

Prosecutors also alleged that he helped Chinese consulate officials gain access to senior NYPD officials.

According to the complaint, Angwang also works as a civil affairs specialist in the Army Reserve, holding the rank of staff sergeant and is stationed at Fort Dix, New Jersey. His work involves planning, training, and executing civil-military programs, the document said. He holds a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù level security clearance in connection with this role.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, with more than 160 journalists around the world, reported on Sept. 20 that large multinational banks such as HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank, Bank of New York Mellon, etc., were suspected of assisting criminals, laundering money, and transferring funds up to $2 trillion dollars. Shares in the world‚Äôs largest banks plummeted and regulators demanded reform hours after the release of the latest investigation. HSBC and Standard Chartered shares touched their lowest level in as much as 25 years, Reuters reported. 

A number of international journalists conducted investigations based on more than 2,100 suspicious activity reports filed by banks. ICIJ analysis found documents identifying more than $2 trillion in transactions between 1999 and 2017 that were flagged by financial institutions‚Äô internal compliance officers as possible money laundering or other criminal activity ‚Äî including $514 billion at JPMorgan and $1.3 trillion at Deutsche Bank.

JPMorgan, the largest bank based in the United States, moved money for people and companies tied to the massive looting of public funds in Malaysia, Venezuela, and Ukraine, the leaked documents reveal. HSBC continued to move money for questionable characters, including suspected Russian money launderers and a Ponzi scheme under investigation in multiple countries. Deutsche Bank was suspected of laundering money for Ukrainian billionaires.
----
U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News on Monday morning that if U.S. companies or investors do not have complete control over TikTok, the transaction will not be approved.

On Sept. 19, President Trump approved in principle a deal under which Oracle and Walmart would receive ownership stakes in Chinese-owned app TikTok. Secretary of State Pompeo said in an interview on Sept. 20 that the only principle of the U.S. government is to ensure that Americans‚Äô data does not fall into the hands of the CCP.

In an interview with Maria Bartiromo, the host of Fox News Sunday Morning Feature on Sept. 21, Pompeo said that Europe has changed its perception toward China and that the CCP threatens Western values ‚Äã‚Äãin aspects such as faith and trade. He also stated that Europe will join forces with the United States to fight against the CCP.

4078,"Many historians agree that the North American figure of Santa Claus can be traced back to a monk named Saint Nicholas of Myra, a bearded fourth-century Greek Christian with a penchant for charitable giving. St. Nicholas was presumably the basis for the Dutch Sinterklaas, patron saint of children, who donned a big, red cape and rode around on a white horse to visit children on the name day of Saint Nicholas, the sixth of December. According to folklore, Sinterklaas carried a red book in which he recorded a child‚Äôs behavior over the past year as having been good or naughty. Sinterklaas is said to have been slowly transformed into modern-day Santa by 1700s Dutch immigrants in the New World.

In order to prevent Chinese aluminum producers from invading the Korean market, the Korean aluminum industry began jointly resisting a Chinese aluminum giant from entering the market in South Jeolla Province‚Äôs Gwangyang Bay Area since 2018. 

In November 2018, Henan Mingtai Aluminum, a Chinese aluminum sheet manufacturer, signed an investment contract with the Gwangyang Bay Area Free Economic Zone authority. It plans to invest $40 billion won ($32.8 million USD) to produce aluminum products. The groundbreaking ceremony was held in December 2018 to kick off the construction of the plant, but the project was opposed by the Korean aluminum industry.
 
Mingtai Aluminum is the second-most prolific producer of rolled aluminium in China. The Korean aluminum industry believes that its annual production of rolled aluminum is equivalent to over 80% of South Korea's, which would severely undercut South Korea‚Äôs domestic aluminium producers. 

Jiang Haoxiang, Vice Chairman of the Korea Nonferrous Metals Association, said, ""The production scale of Mingtai Aluminum in South Korea is 100,000 tons of plates and 20,000 tons of foil a year, which is equivalent to the production scale of two Korean companies. Thus, losses are inevitable for Korea's domestic producers.‚Äù 

South Korean officials believe that introducing such a substantial player in the global aluminium market to South Korea will surely drive up aluminum production, with a corresponding drop in aluminum prices. The Korean industry suspects that by entering South Korea‚Äôs market under unfavorable cost conditions, Chinese manufacturing companies‚Äô might be using South Korea as a roundabout export base. If this is the case, there may be potential trade friction between South Korea and the United States in the future. 

Jiang Haoxiang said, ""The Trump administration has proposed higher anti-dumping duties. We have concerns that China is using South Korea as a production base to enter the US market."" 

The industry is doubtful about the ""employment promotion"" effect of the Foreign Investment Promotion Act. Meanwhile,  it is concerned that unreasonable foreign investments will cause Korean companies to close down, leading to an increased unemployment rate and possible leakage of advanced technology.

Jiang Haoxiang said, ""Our domestic companies and Mingtai Aluminum produce many similar aluminum products. South Korea‚Äôs ultra-thin technology is actually more advanced than China‚Äôs. Thus, we are worried about whether the ultra-thin technology and other advanced technology will flow into China.‚Äù

The Korean industry is very worried that if large Chinese companies such as Mingtai Aluminum successfully invest in South Korea, more investments will follow, leading to more domestic companies suffering losses.

The story began in 2012, when two men walked into his family-run bakery, and asked Jack to create a custom cake for their same-sex wedding ceremony. Because of his Christian faith, Jack declined, and instead offered to sell them something different.

The couple ‚Äústormed out,‚Äù Jack said, then sued him under Colorado‚Äôs anti-discrimination law. After losing his case before the Colorado commission and the Colorado Court of Appeals, which both ruled that that Jack has no First Amendment rights, Jack has one more chance before the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear his case Tuesday.

In The Daily Signal‚Äôs feature video above, Jack and his daughter Lisa Eldfrick tell the story from their side, and share how this journey has affected their faith.

There has been a dismissive attitude in understanding the gaps and flaws in the progressive, socialist ideology and how it is antithetical to the core, fundamental, values of the inner city, black community. Finally, a Republican, President Trump, tripped over the golden acorn, perhaps blindly so, and found the immense nugget of truth for which the left has no defense.

4144,"We are witnessing a watershed moment in American cultural history: the sabotaging of family and marriage. Extreme-left radicals have made their arguments and tried different tactics, from the early nineteenth century to the sexual revolution of the 1960s, but at long last they have the vehicle to make it happen: gay marriage. Now, as the legal definition of marriage rapidly changes, the floodgates are open, and the fundamental transformation of the American family will take on new speed and new dimensions. Efforts to redefine the family structure have been long at work, and there have been some influential forces on the far left and communist left that cannot and should not be ignored in that process.

In ""Takedown"" Paul Kengor exposes these origins, starting with Karl Marx, and traces them through the sordid history of people like Margaret Sanger, Wilhelm Reich, Herbert Marcuse and assorted '60s radicals. What were once fringe concepts have become accepted by mainstream thought and are today welcomed by many legislators and judges. Kengor notes how in the not-so-distant past, today's leftists who are attacking traditional marriage would have loudly raised their voices but not caused any real damage. They would have been dismissed with no serious concern as left-wing cranks, crackpot German and Austrian atheistic philosophers and campus agitators. But now, with formal legalization of same-sex marriage afoot, they are getting what they‚Äôve wanted for generations: the literal redefinition of the family.

""Takedown"" exposes how gay marriage is serving as a Trojan horse for the far left to secure the final takedown of marriage that it has long wanted, and countless everyday Americans are oblivious to the deeper forces at work. ""Takedown"" takes no prisoners and bluntly shows the reader that even Karl Marx and his more anti-marriage comrade Engels would be dumbfounded at the mere thought that modern Americans would gladly join them in their rejection of God's design for natural marriage and the family.

Glenn has had enough of exposing scandal after scandal, just for everyone to look the other way: Benghazi, Hillary Clinton's emails, Joe and Hunter Biden's dealings in Ukraine and China...the list goes on, but no consequences are ever paid. So while the mainstream media has called the election for Joe Biden, and insists no one can question it, Glenn gives a rallying cry to conservatives. Many of the over 71 million people who voted for President Trump are split between frustration and an urge to do something. The multiple allegations of election fraud are largely out of our hands, and Donald Trump's legal team must be allowed to go through the process to ensure our voting systems are fair. But that doesn't mean we have to sit on our hands.

In recent remarks to an AIM conference, ""ObamaNation: A Day of Truth,"" former Democratic pollster and analyst Pat Caddell said, ""I think we're at the most dangerous time in our political history in terms of the balance of power in the role that the media plays in whether or not we maintain a free democracy."" Caddell noted that while First Amendment protections were originally provided to the press so they would protect the liberty and freedom of the public from ""organized governmental power,"" they had clearly relinquished the role of impartial news providers. 
 Nowhere was this more evident than during the tragic death of a U.S. ambassador in Libya that was lied about for nine days, because the press and the administration did not want to admit it was a terrorist attack. 
""We've had nine days of lies over what happened because they can't dare say it's a terrorist attack, and the press won't push this,"" said Caddell. ""Yesterday there was not a single piece in The New York Times over the question of Libya. Twenty American embassies, yesterday, are under attack. None of that is on the national news. None of it is being pressed in the papers.""
Caddell added that it is one thing for the news to have a biased view, but ""It is another thing to specifically decide that you will not tell the American people information they have a right to know.""",1,Accuracy in Media

4167,"Willcox, Arizona. Population 3,500. ‚ÄúIt's not unlike many other towns one might pass by on the freeway while driving around the American West,‚Äù the filmmaker Zack Wright told The Atlantic. 

Driving by is exactly what Wright and his co-director, Ryan Maxey, were doing when they happened to tune into KHIL, the town‚Äôs country-music station. ‚ÄúWere treated to a half hour of great, obscure country music as we passed through Willcox,‚Äù Wright said. The station soon fell out of range, but the filmmakers were fascinated by what they‚Äôd heard. They wanted to know who was responsible.

‚ÄúWhen we met up with Mark, he was not at all what we expected,‚Äù Wright said. ‚ÄúWe were picturing an old-timer cowboy type‚Äîsome kind of great champion of old country music. But he was not that at all.‚Äù 

Mark Lucke, it turned out, was the station‚Äôs only employee. A single parent who lived out of the office with his son, Lucke explained that he had a complicated relationship with Willcox, the townspeople, and country music in general. ‚ÄúIn fact, he has a traumatic past with the genre,‚Äù Maxey said. ‚ÄúHe's a bit of a tragic hero, a lone cowboy who happens to prefer metal and horror films over Rex Allen movies and country tunes. But he finds meaning in connecting with other lonely souls over the radio.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to reach out of that radio and say to older listeners, ‚ÄòHey. You can feel good again,‚Äô‚Äù Lucke says in Lonesome Willcox, Maxey and Wright‚Äôs short documentary, a wistful portrait of the town, its radio station, and the local pariah who runs it.

A long article by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) mouthpiece Xinhua News Agency that lambasted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for criticizing the communist regime has unexpectedly backfired, as Chinese netizens expressed support for Pompeo and criticized the CCP.

On August 25, Xinhua published a 30,000-word article to criticize the speech Pompeo delivered outside the Nixon Presidential Library in California on July 23. Xinhua said it was ‚Äúa total negation of the China-U.S. relations‚Äù and ‚Äúmalicious attacks‚Äù on the CCP‚Äôs political system, and ‚Äúundermines the CCP‚Äôs relations with the Chinese people.‚Äù It then excerpted 26 passages from Pompeo‚Äôs speech, and criticized them one by one.

In its first passage, Xinhua quoted and combined three partial sentences from Pompeo‚Äôs speech: ‚ÄúThe Chinese people are completely distinct from the Chinese Communist Party. ‚Ä¶ The biggest lie that they tell is to think that they speak for 1.4 billion people. ‚Ä¶ The CCP fears the Chinese people‚Äôs honest opinions more than any foe.‚Äù


Summer Snow, Hail, and Monsoon Floods Continue to Ravage China

China is seeing its longest monsoon season and record rainfalls this year. Moreover, areas outside the ‚Äúmonsoon territory,‚Äù such as northeastern China, were also hit by torrential rains on Sept. 1, causing serious flooding.

Sichuan Province, located in southwest China, was one of the worst flooded regions in August. Just a few days earlier, locals were busy cleaning up the mess when previous flood waters receded. Unexpectedly, another round of heavy downpours flooded cities and villages again on Aug 30. 

Mount Wutai is home to a number of China's most famous and well-respected Buddhist temples. On Aug. 27, Mount Wutai was hit by a rare snow, and tourists had to purchase or rent winter jackets to keep warm. 

An intense hail storm battered Baotou, capital city of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, on Sept. 1. The ground was covered by a thick layer of hail stones.  

On the same day, Beijing was also hit by hail, along with heavy rains and strong winds. 


Chinese Citizen Journalist Goes on Hunger Strike for Wrongful Prosecution

Zhang Zhan, a Shanghai citizen journalist, was arrested while conducting interviews in Wuhan during the epidemic and was subsequently taken into criminal detention. Recently, this case has been sent to the prosecutor's office for review and prosecution.

It was reported that Zhang Zhan has been on a hunger strike in the detention center so she is physically weak. Because she was doing interviews in Wuhan during the epidemic, she was arrested by the CCP for picking quarrels and provoking trouble. According to her family members, they have been forcibly feeding Zhang Zhan since she was on a hunger strike in the detention center. Zhang‚Äôs health is extremely bad.

In early February, Zhang Zhan went to Wuhan to report the local situation during the epidemic. She visited hospitals‚Äô emergency rooms, interviewed patients who went to fever clinics, went to Wuhan train station to interview travellers, and visited factories to report underemployment. She then uploaded and published her interview content to social media such as WeChat, Twitter, and YouTube.

On May 14, she was arrested in a hotel in Wuhan. On May 15, she was detained by Shanghai police and is currently detained at the Pudong New District Detention Center. Mr. Lu from Wuhan indicated that going on hunger strike is to fight for basic human rights.

4235,"In October 2012, Carey Callahan began a course of bimonthly intramuscular testosterone injections. After years of harassment and discomfort in her female body, she had made the decision to transition to being male. In the short term, she was happy. But she soon discovered that life as a transgender man was not what she had expected. Her discomfort persisted, as did the harassment.

Nine months after her first injection, Carey stopped hormone-replacement therapy. A year after that, she made the decision to return to identifying as female. ‚ÄúI regret it,‚Äù Carey says of her choice to transition in a new Atlantic documentary.

Recently, Carey began speaking out about her experience, joining a small but vocal group of so-called detransitioners, as profiled in Jesse Singal‚Äôs cover story for the July/August issue of The Atlantic.

4249,"What happens when a major metropolitan area runs out of water? The 4.5 million residents of Cape Town are hoping they won‚Äôt have to find out. The South African city has been experiencing a severe water crisis since early 2017, when the municipal government began pleading with residents to conserve water. In October of that year, as the situation worsened, the city enforced water restrictions and mandated household rationing, a program that Mayor Patricia de Lille called the New Normal. ‚ÄúAs a permanent drought region,‚Äù de Lille announced in a press conference, ‚Äúwe have to change our relationship with water as a scarce resource.‚Äù The program was aimed at preventing an outcome that seemed increasingly inevitable: Day Zero, when taps across the city would run dry.

Simon Wood and Francois Verster‚Äôs short documentary, ""Scenes from a Dry City,"" depicts Cape Town at the height of its water crisis. Residents scramble to circumvent restrictions in order to maintain their livelihoods. Families endure long lines at water distribution points. Protests spring up across the city, drawing attention to the inequities associated with the privatization of water. The film, created with Field of Vision and premiering on The Atlantic today, is a deeply revealing observational portrait of a city struggling to adapt to scarcity. In many ways, it is a harbinger of things to come. Read more: https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/584179/dry-city/

""Scenes from a Dry City"" was directed by Simon Wood and Francois Verster, and produced by Field of Vision (fieldofvision.org/). It is part of The Atlantic Selects, an online showcase of short documentaries from independent creators, curated by The Atlantic.

4254,"James O'Keefe Premieres ""Expose: Hollywood's War on US Energy"" at Cannes Hollywood celebrities caught on hidden camera accepting money from ""Middle Eastern oil interests""
 
CANNES -- In a blockbuster new video, Project Veritas has exposed the truth about the dark funding behind Hollywood's anti-fracking messaging machine.
 
New York Times Bestselling Author and Project Veritas founder and president James O'Keefe debuted the latest investigation at a ""premiere"" in Cannes, France on Wednesday.
 
In the investigation, an undercover journalist from Project Veritas posed as a member of a Middle Eastern oil dynasty and offered $9 million in funding to American filmmakers to fund an anti-fracking movie.
 
In video from a meeting with Ed Begley Jr., Mariel Hemingway and Josh Tickell, a Project Veritas investigator disguised as ""Muhammed"" offered $9 million for an anti-fracking film.  ""Muhammad"" clearly states: ""If Washington DC continues fracking, America will be energy efficient, and then they won't need my oil anymore.""
 
In the same conversation, Begley and Hemingway accept the funding and agree to hide the source of funds for the anti-fracking movie.  Hemingway agreeing that those who will know the source of the funding are ""only at this table."" 
 
Ed Begley Jr. is an outspoken environmental activist and current Governor on the board of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science (the organization that brings us the OSCARS every year.)
 
Mariel Hemingway is a Golden Globe- and Oscar-nominated actress.
 
Josh Tickell is a Sundance Film Festival Winner and the director of environmental message movies ""Fuel"", ""The Big Fix"" and ""PUMP"".
 
Team Begley even submitted a video of Oscar-nominated actor Mark Ruffalo offering his unwavering support for the fictitious anti-fracking film project.
 
The meeting came about after a series of discussions with Josh and Rebecca Tickell.  A Project Veritas journalist posed as an ad executive seeking to broker a deal for his client (""Muhammed"") to fund an American-made anti-fracking film.  
 
In a phone call to Tickell, the ad executive states: ""My client's interest is to end American energy independence; your interest is to end fracking.  And you guys understand that?""
 
Tickell's response: ""Correct.  Yes, super clear.""
 
Tickell makes it clear on the tape that revealing the source of funding for an activist film can undermine its credibility.  Tickell notes that the movie ""Promised Land"" undermined its own message because it was labeled as being funded by Image Nation Abu Dhabi.  His advice: ""So rather than putting that [the source of funding] up front, don't mention that.""
 
In a follow-up call with Josh and Rebecca Tickell, Rebecca Tickell assures our investigator:  ""We would never tell about where the funding is coming from.  That would be really awkward for us.""
 
Josh Tickell: ""We're confident that we can keep this zip locked, you know tight, air-tight forever.  If we don't protect who is kind of funding this thing, if we have to disclose that or that becomes a necessary part of it, the whole enterprise will not work."" 
 
Project Veritas founder and president James O'Keefe stated Wednesday:
 
""This latest investigation shows the dark side of Hollywood's environmental movement.  Hollywood is willing to take and conceal money from Middle Eastern oil interests in order to advance their cause of destroying American energy independence.""

The 11-point gap is nearly double that recorded in 2016 when 52 percent of Democrats and 46 percent of Republicans said they were more likely to inform others of their voting intentions.

‚ÄúSome analysts before and after Donald Trump‚Äôs upset victory suggested that most pollsters missed his hidden support among voters fearful of criticism who were unwilling to say where they stood,‚Äù Rasmussen stated in a press release.

4369,"Scientists and other experts have warned for years that the nation‚Äôs electrical grid system, together with other critical infrastructures that have an almost complete dependency on electricity and electronic components, are highly vulnerable to an electromagnetic pulse event, either from natural or man-made causes.

However, Congress and the administrations of previous and current presidents largely have ignored those warnings.

Events such as the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States, and then the devastating Hurricane Katrina that revealed vulnerabilities to those infrastructures, for a time heightened that concern. Due to the lapse of time and a relatively calm period since those disasters, policymakers have been lulled back into complacency rather than taking preventative action against what could be the biggest threat to U.S. national and economic security in our lifetime.

An electromagnetic pulse attack on our critical infrastructures, either from an impending solar storm of serious intensity expected between 2012 and 2014 or from a high-altitude nuclear explosion, could have long-term catastrophic consequences for our society and our way of life.

A few years ago, a congressional commission went into considerable depth on those consequences to our electricity-dependent infrastructures that include not only the power grid itself but also telecommunications, our banking and finance system, our transportation system that delivers the very food and water on which our society depends on a daily basis, and the fuel needed to keep our houses warm in the winter and air-conditioned during the summer.

While these critical infrastructures continue to face such an impending crisis, Congress basically has ignored its own commission report and instead has treated the threat of an electromagnetic pulse event as a political football to be weighed against the need to establish an antiballistic missile system. Out of the debate, nothing has happened in either direction.

""A Nation Forsaken"" breaks down that threat. It even outlines how our own military similarly is vulnerable to an electromagnetic pulse event due to its 99-percent dependency on the nation‚Äôs electrical grid system for electricity and communications, raising the high prospect that it may not be able to function to defend the nation in its time of greatest need.

While an electromagnetic pulse event on our civilian infrastructure could be serious, it can be managed if government at the federal, state and local levels gives a high priority to undertaking preventative action to lessen its impact and enhance our ability to recover from it. Given what seems to be a perpetual gridlock in Congress, however, don‚Äôt count on it.",1,WorldNetDaily

4374,"We are witnessing a watershed moment in American cultural history: the sabotaging of family and marriage. Extreme-left radicals have made their arguments and tried different tactics, from the early nineteenth century to the sexual revolution of the 1960s, but at long last they have the vehicle to make it happen: gay marriage. Now, as the legal definition of marriage rapidly changes, the floodgates are open, and the fundamental transformation of the American family will take on new speed and new dimensions. Efforts to redefine the family structure have been long at work, and there have been some influential forces on the far left and communist left that cannot and should not be ignored in that process.

In ""Takedown"" Paul Kengor exposes these origins, starting with Karl Marx, and traces them through the sordid history of people like Margaret Sanger, Wilhelm Reich, Herbert Marcuse and assorted '60s radicals. What were once fringe concepts have become accepted by mainstream thought and are today welcomed by many legislators and judges. Kengor notes how in the not-so-distant past, today's leftists who are attacking traditional marriage would have loudly raised their voices but not caused any real damage. They would have been dismissed with no serious concern as left-wing cranks, crackpot German and Austrian atheistic philosophers and campus agitators. But now, with formal legalization of same-sex marriage afoot, they are getting what they‚Äôve wanted for generations: the literal redefinition of the family.

""Takedown"" exposes how gay marriage is serving as a Trojan horse for the far left to secure the final takedown of marriage that it has long wanted, and countless everyday Americans are oblivious to the deeper forces at work. ""Takedown"" takes no prisoners and bluntly shows the reader that even Karl Marx and his more anti-marriage comrade Engels would be dumbfounded at the mere thought that modern Americans would gladly join them in their rejection of God's design for natural marriage and the family.

At around 3:30 PM on April 8th, while the train station staff were patrolling near the Cyberport on Dazhi Road, a man was found lying unconscious on the street. 

The videographer said,
 ‚ÄúStay away from Dazhi Road. Someone suddenly fell. Just fell here."" 
""Oh my God, he fell and didn't move.‚Äù

The authorities later issued a statement claiming that the man was ‚Äúpassed out drunk"", but the outside world remains skeptical.

4410,"Scientists and other experts have warned for years that the nation‚Äôs electrical grid system, together with other critical infrastructures that have an almost complete dependency on electricity and electronic components, are highly vulnerable to an electromagnetic pulse event, either from natural or man-made causes.

However, Congress and the administrations of previous and current presidents largely have ignored those warnings.

Events such as the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States, and then the devastating Hurricane Katrina that revealed vulnerabilities to those infrastructures, for a time heightened that concern. Due to the lapse of time and a relatively calm period since those disasters, policymakers have been lulled back into complacency rather than taking preventative action against what could be the biggest threat to U.S. national and economic security in our lifetime.

An electromagnetic pulse attack on our critical infrastructures, either from an impending solar storm of serious intensity expected between 2012 and 2014 or from a high-altitude nuclear explosion, could have long-term catastrophic consequences for our society and our way of life.

A few years ago, a congressional commission went into considerable depth on those consequences to our electricity-dependent infrastructures that include not only the power grid itself but also telecommunications, our banking and finance system, our transportation system that delivers the very food and water on which our society depends on a daily basis, and the fuel needed to keep our houses warm in the winter and air-conditioned during the summer.

While these critical infrastructures continue to face such an impending crisis, Congress basically has ignored its own commission report and instead has treated the threat of an electromagnetic pulse event as a political football to be weighed against the need to establish an antiballistic missile system. Out of the debate, nothing has happened in either direction.

""A Nation Forsaken"" breaks down that threat. It even outlines how our own military similarly is vulnerable to an electromagnetic pulse event due to its 99-percent dependency on the nation‚Äôs electrical grid system for electricity and communications, raising the high prospect that it may not be able to function to defend the nation in its time of greatest need.

While an electromagnetic pulse event on our civilian infrastructure could be serious, it can be managed if government at the federal, state and local levels gives a high priority to undertaking preventative action to lessen its impact and enhance our ability to recover from it. Given what seems to be a perpetual gridlock in Congress, however, don‚Äôt count on it.",1,WorldNetDaily

Last week, the U.S. and China shut down each other's consulates as the situation continues to escalate. On July 26, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz indicated that the CCP has been engaged in espionage and intellectual property theft, and that more of Chinese consulates may be closed in the future. So what do the Chinese people think of this incident?

On July 26, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz indicated in the interview with the host of Face the Nation, Margaret Brennan, that ‚Äúthe consulate was closed because it had been engaged in espionage. It had been engaged in intellectual property theft. They use it as a base for spying in Houston and throughout the Southwest.‚Äù When he was asked if more consulates will be closed, Cruz said it is very possible. Previously on July 22, President Trump also indicated that it is possible to close more Chinese consulates in the U.S.

On July 24, the CCP ordered the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu to close within 72 hours. The state-run media claimed in a massive propaganda campaign that the United States was politically provocative. However, there are Chinese citizens believing that there must be a reason behind this event.

Senior media personnel, Huang Jin-Qiu believes that the U.S. government has now clearly distinguished between the CCP and the Chinese people, and is considering banning CCP officials and their family members from entering the country. This shows that the U.S. has realized the danger of the CCP.

He and a team of scientists are working to combat the crisis in the world‚Äôs coral reefs‚Äîthat is, that human beings have lost 25 to 40 percent of the world‚Äôs corals in recent decades due largely to seawater temperature rise and continued acidification of the ocean. Vaughan has developed a technique called ‚Äúmicro-fragmenting‚Äù that allows corals to grow more than 25 times faster than normal, which could rapidly restore the dwindling population of healthy coral reefs. The Atlantic went inside the Mote Tropical Research Laboratory in Summerland Key, Florida, where Vaughan is the executive director, to uncover how the process works and understand how much hope there is to reverse the damage caused by humans.

4499,"Many people assume that they perceive the world as it actually is‚Äîas if eyes and ears were windows that allow us to access an objective reality. But perception is not an accurate reflection of an externally existing world.

‚ÄúIn fact,‚Äù the neuroscientist Anil Seth says, ‚Äúperception and hallucination have a lot in common. You could say that we‚Äôre all hallucinating all of the time, and when we agree about our hallucinations, that‚Äôs what we call reality.‚Äù

In an animated video from Carolyn Merriman of the Future of StoryTelling, Seth explains how the brain operates on implicit beliefs accumulated over thousands of years of human evolution. These, he explains, are what ‚Äúturn the raw material of sensory data into our projected perceptual realities.‚Äù

Most of the time, we can all agree on these perceptions. But sometimes this consensus breaks down, such as in the case of the Internet phenomena of the white-and-gold versus black-and-blue dress or the ‚Äúlaurel‚Äù versus ‚Äúyanny‚Äù audio clip. These are stark reminders of what Seth describes as the ‚Äúneurological guesswork that happens behind the scenes.‚Äù In these moments, the curtain is lifted on the theater‚Äînot the window‚Äîof our reality.

‚ÄúOur brain is doing its best to make sense of ambiguous sensory input,‚Äù Merriman told The Atlantic. ‚ÄúIn some ways, our perception of the world is just the story our brains are telling us based on the sum of our senses.‚Äù

The mind‚Äôs ability to create this congruous narrative of reality continues to awe Seth. ‚ÄúI am inspired by how such a small biological machine inside my head‚Äîinside the head of everyone‚Äîcan create such a rich inner universe for each of us from the raw material of sensory signals,‚Äù he told The Atlantic. ‚ÄúThis is a monumental achievement, one that is far outside the scope of any artificial machine or computer we‚Äôve ever constructed.‚Äù

""Neuroscience of Perception"" was produced by The Future of Storytelling and Carolyn Merriman. It is part of The Atlantic Selects, an online showcase of short documentaries from independent creators, curated by The Atlantic.

Two divergent views of the drug, hydroxychloroquine, have emerged: the negative one widely reported in the press and another side you‚Äôve probably heard less about. Never has a discussion about choices of medicine been so laced with political overtones. Today, how politics, money and medicine intersect with coronavirus.

4529,"Where do politics, memes, black culture, and activism come together online? You‚Äôve guessed it: Black Twitter! Here's how this blackity black online community has changed Al Gore‚Äôs Internet and the world as we know it for the better.

From its cultural commentary to its humor and ability to create social justice movements, Black Twitter is a space fueled by the ingenuity of black folks. And while we know that the online community emerged roughly a decade ago‚Äîwhat kind of legacy has it created?

Professor Meredith D. Clark is a former journalist and assistant professor at the University of Virginia. She‚Äôs working on a forthcoming book about Black Twitter and says that the community created by black folks on Twitter has had a tremendous influence on the Twittersphere, and beyond. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say that black Twitter has shaped the culture of Twitter the same way that black culture has shaped American culture for years. The things that happen on Black Twitter and the people who take note of them are just like so-called culture vultures in other subsets of culture,‚Äù Clark told The Root.

As a writer, activist and author, George M. Johnson is another prominent voice on Twitter. Johnson uses his platform to speak up for black and queer people. While, overall, his experiences on the app have been positive, they haven‚Äôt all been easy. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs like if I talk about the fact that I‚Äôm HIV positive, right. If I talk about some of the things I‚Äôve been through, when I‚Äôm in a moment where people disagree, they oftentimes will use that to attack me.‚Äù But Johnson says, to some extent these attacks on twitter come with the territory of being visible and unapologetically vocal on Twitter.

Feminista Jones is an author and feminist. A ‚ÄúTwitter OG,‚Äù she has been on the app for over a decade. Jones says that while she is unsure as to whether or not Twitter will exist in another decade, she‚Äôs certain that the online community of black people will live on.

‚ÄúWe were on MySpace, we were on Black Planet,‚Äù Jones continued. ‚ÄúWe were we are on YouTube, Facebook. We‚Äôre everywhere. We‚Äôre going to be everywhere because we are a black community and we are a global community. So we‚Äôll find each other. Whether Twitter exists or not.‚Äù

In this episode of Unpack That, look back at how Black Twitter changed the world this decade.",0,The Root

4537,"Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp recently signed into law Senate Bill 202, garnering severe backlash from many politicians, including President Joe Biden, who referred to it as ‚ÄúJim Crow on steroids."" 

Many have criticized the bill for alleged voter suppression. 

However, the bill actually expands voting access in various ways. It widens weekend early voting to two Saturdays rather than one and allows counties the option to open early voting for two Sundays as well.  Additionally, the bill clarifies and solidifies polling hours, bans electioneering within 150 feet of polling stations, and requires identification verification for in-person and mail-in voting. 

Campus Reform went to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. to read off the components of the bill, before revealing that it was the Georgia law.

Most students were widely supportive of the bill, applauding its voter expansion. But what were their reactions when they found out this was SB202?

Watch the full video above to find out.

Conspiracy theories, attempt to ‚Äúexplain an event or set of circumstances as the result of a secret plot by usually powerful conspirators.‚Äù Scholars say (pdf) that conspiracy theories tend to have a long shelf life, though there is no concrete evidence to prove that they are true.

And that ‚Äúlove‚Äù is at the expense of everyone else in this country, especially Black folks.

It‚Äôs evident that white privilege invades and exists in every space in the United States; from the racial wealth gap to where people can live, or whether or not they can vote, and how students are educated, just to name a few. Even if it appears subtle, whiteness and its advantages are very real.

‚ÄúThe bottom line right here is that pollsters in America do not know how to poll the American people anymore,‚Äù Jashinksy said. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs not just for reasons that have to do with Trump, it‚Äôs for technological reasons and for all kinds of reasons.‚Äù

While the election once again surpassed the expectations of professional, corporate pollsters, Domenech notes that no matter the presidential election results, Trump gained ground with certain racial and ethnic groups which both the media and the left suggested was not possible.

‚ÄúThe dynamic that I think we will continue to see in this election is Donald Trump is losing certain factions of his base from 2016, but also gaining incredibly among a more diverse population, increasing his level of support among African Americans, particularly African American men, and also overwhelmingly increasing his support among Hispanics,‚Äù Domenech said.

4559,"The Northwest Territories encompasses some of the northernmost regions of Canada and extends high into the Arctic Circle. It is about twice the size of Texas but home to only 44,000 residents, who live in small communities spread across its vast area. The capital city of Yellowknife is 1,500 kilometers from the next-closest major city. It‚Äôs cold, ruggedly beautiful, and very isolated.

The region‚Äôs remoteness, its limited health resources, and the history of infectious disease among the predominantly indigenous population sparked an austere response to the spread of the coronavirus. Upon the discovery of its first case, the territory closed its borders to outside travel and implemented strict self-isolation measures.

These measures have left many residents out of work. Pat Kane, a documentary photographer from Yellowknife, was forced to give up a number of jobs. His community was housebound. His wife suggested that he make up for lost work by offering to take family portraits of his quarantined friends through their windows. He posted the idea to Facebook and responses poured in.

A new short documentary from The Atlantic follows Kane as he spends a day taking ‚Äúisolation portraits‚Äù of his community in lockdown. The photographs illuminate the high stakes of coronavirus prevention in the Arctic and the community‚Äôs solidarity.

Shriver is the author of the new novel, ‚ÄúThe Motion of The Body Through Space.‚Äù

AVAILABLE HERE: https://www.amazon.com/Motion-Body-Through-Space-Novel/dp/0062328255

Shriver argued the left now dictates how fiction writers must assign their characters.

The woke left has limited author creativity and made books less interesting, she said, by setting a standard for each type of character.

4600,"On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Cornell University Professor Laurent Dubreuil joins Culture Editor Emily Jashinsky to discuss the takeover of American society by identity politics, and how it‚Äôs fueled by social media and our algorithm overlords.

According to Dubreuil, the rise of identity politics in the U.S. has created a new version of racism that is already posing a danger to many.

‚Äú[Identity politics] is a way of narrowing down the experience to such an extent that racism, of course, will be reinforced. Not the same kind of Old South racism that we knew,  but another kind of polished and kind of superficial, but deep racism that will not show its true colors,‚Äù he said. 

Part of the problem with this new phenomenon, Dubreuil believes, is the strong technological presence of algorithms in our society today.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really tied to the way social media works. It‚Äôs not a coincidence. It‚Äôs really tied to the way we have written algorithms and software that animate and move the whole structure of social media, to sell you the right pair of boots, or the right car that you need that is in line with what your supposed identity is,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThose technical technological tools are not neutral at all.‚Äù

In his essay ‚ÄúNonconforming: against the erosion of academic freedom by identity politics,‚Äù Dubreuil argues that the solution to ensuring the cessation of this identity-politics takeover is to speak up and promote free thinking.

‚ÄúAs soon as we believe that social circumstances are absolute determinations, or worse, ‚Äòwhat we are,‚Äô we condemn ourselves to the endless repetition of the past, and to the methodical destruction of new possibilities,‚Äù Dubreuil wrote.

4603,"On December 26, 2018, Executive Director John Burtka appeared on Fox Business to discuss his Washington Post op-ed, ""The Weekly Standard is gone. But the future of conservatism is bright."" 

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-weekly-standard-is-gone-but-the-future-of-conservatism-is-bright/2018/12/19/2fa2c8d4-039d-11e9-9122-82e98f91ee6f_story.html?utm_term=.0b505940f3da",1,The American Conservative
4604,"The American public was nearly deprived of the opportunity to read this book.

In 2012 popular historian David Barton set out to correct what he saw as the distorted image of a once-beloved Founding Father, Thomas Jefferson, in what became a New York Times best-selling book, The Jefferson Lies.

Despite the wildly popular success of the original hardcover edition, or perhaps because of it, a campaign to discredit Barton s scholarship was launched by bloggers and a handful of non-historian academics.

What happened next was shocking virtually unprecedented in modern American publishing history. Under siege from critics, the publisher spiked the book and recalled it from the retail shelves from coast to coast. The Jefferson Lies is thus a history book that made history becoming possibly the first book of its kind to be victimized by the scourge of political correctness.

But more than three years later, it s back as an updated paperback edition in which Barton sets the record straight and takes on the critics who savaged his work.

And that s just part of the story. Why did this book spark so much controversy?

It could only happen in an America that has forgotten its past. Its roots, its purpose, its identity all have become shrouded behind a veil of political correctness bent on twisting the nation's founding, and its Founders, beyond recognition.

The time has come to remember again.

This new paperback edition of The Jefferson Lies re-documents Barton's research and conclusions as sound and his premises true. It tackles seven myths about Thomas Jefferson head-on, and answers pressing questions about this incredible statesman including:

Did Thomas Jefferson really have a child by his young slave girl, Sally Hemings?
Did he write his own Bible, excluding the parts of Christianity with which he disagreed?
Was he a racist who opposed civil rights and equality for black Americans?
Did he, in his pursuit of separation of church and state, advocate the secularizing of public life?
Through Jefferson's own words and the eyewitness testimony of contemporaries, Barton repaints a portrait of the man from Monticello as a visionary, an innovator, a man who revered Jesus, a classical Renaissance man, and a man whose pioneering stand for liberty and God-given inalienable rights fostered a better world for this nation and its posterity. For America, the time to remember these truths is now.

On August 31, David Stilwell, the assistant secretary of State for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, announced a significant adjustment to the U.S. policy toward Taiwan. He also reiterated the U.S. stance on the ""One-China"" policy, emphasizing that the U.S. has no position on Taiwan sovereignty.

David Stilwell attended a seminar hosted by The Heritage Foundation in which he indicated that the U.S. will follow the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the three joint communique between Washington and Beijing, and the Six Assurances provided by President Reagan to Taipei in 1982 as the guidelines for the U.S. policy toward Taiwan. These significant adjustments are still well within the boundaries of the one-China policy of the U.S.

Stilwell recognized Taiwan‚Äôs great success in battling against the CCP virus and also recognized the fact that Taiwan is the ""critical node in global high-tech trade flows and U.S. technology supply chains, including for semiconductors and smart machinery."" He indicated that the U.S. looks forward to working with ""trusted partners like Taiwan"" and will ""ensure that next-generation technologies, data, and intellectual property are protected from theft and manipulation by malign actors.""

4611,"‚ÄúTwo nationally-acclaimed real estate entrepreneurs share biblical principles to revolutionize your work and family life, and give you the courage to stand up for what is right.‚Äù
This book follows the story of highly motivated and entrepreneurial twin brothers, David and Jason Benham, from their formative years and ventures into professional baseball to their rise as owners of a multi-million dollar business empire and securing an HGTV reality series. It‚Äôs a journey where the brothers learned how they must die to their dreams not just once, but twice as they walked away from baseball before being called up to the Big Show and later as their TV series was stripped away from them just before airing when the network succumbed to media pressures surrounding their faith. These experiences only helped them realize that the key to powerful living is found when you die to your dreams and face your fears, and choose to live powerfully through it all. The biblical principles they implemented to guide their work and families are revealed in practical terms to apply to our daily lives and give us courage to stand for what is right.",1,WorldNetDaily

The Hulu mini series, ‚ÄúMrs. America‚Äù depicts the work of Phyllis Schlafly to stand against the women‚Äôs movement and its push to pass the Equal Right Amendment (ERA). 

The series perfectly captures Schlafly‚Äôs hair style and clothing choices but fails to accurately depict the conservative matriarch‚Äôs kindness and strength as she rallied wives and mothers across American in the fight against the ERA. 

Today on Problematic Women we welcome Anne Schlafly Cori, Phyllis Schlafly daughter, to the show to find out the true story behind the ERA fight, who Phyllis Schlafly really was, and what the Hulu series got right and what it did not. 

We also talk with Kirsten Hasler, Executive Director of Eagle Forum‚Äôs D.C. office, about carrying on Schlafly‚Äôs legacy. And as always we will be crowning our Problematic Woman of the week.

4679,"What started as a single show about five rich women in California exploded into one of the biggest reality TV franchises of our generation. In some ways, the Real Housewives recipe is simple: affluent older women, cordial but sometimes fractured friendships, and cast members who technically don‚Äôt even need a husband. But in Housewives‚Äô 14-year history, the model has been tweaked ever so slightly, with varying degrees of success. You could say this was the case with the fifth franchise in the series, The Real Housewives of D.C.

Premiering the summer of 2010, the series didn‚Äôt bring the vapid cattiness of The Real Housewives of Orange County or the table-flipping tension of The Real Housewives of New Jersey. It was political‚Äîdare I say earnest‚Äîand measurably less glitzy than its successor The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. ‚ÄúI think that D.C. was supposed to be more serious,‚Äù says former cast member Lynda Erkiletian, founder of T‚Ä¢H‚Ä¢E Artist Agency and Executive Director of the James and Paula Coburn Foundation.

4680,"Impeachment is a powerful tool. The time to wield it is now, argues the Atlantic senior editor Yoni Appelbaum. In the latest Atlantic Argument, Appelbaum invokes Andrew Johnson‚Äôs impeachment in 1868 to make the case for democratically removing President Donald Trump from office. Appelbaum underscores that this measure is not meant to resolve a policy dispute; rather, it is an attempt to rectify the problem of Trump‚Äôs inability to discharge the basic duties of his office.

‚ÄúThe president is unfit for the office he holds,‚Äù Appelbaum says in the video. ‚ÄúCongress needs to act now and open an impeachment inquiry.‚Äù

Amid court challenges, it's unclear exactly how that will impact high school and college athletes governed by a mix of policies state by state. Earlier this season, we looked at a federal ruling that seemed to say the opposite - high school athletes in Connecticut were not allowed to switch from the boys' team to the girls' team because it deprives girls of athletic opportunities guaranteed under the 1972 Title Nine civil rights law.

In his interview with Bedford, Pack discusses his efforts to combat deep-rooted bias at Voice of America and its affiliates, potential security concerns, his two-year confirmation battle, and what people might not know about the USAGM's international coverage. 

Pack served previously as President of Manifold Productions, Inc., an independent film and television production company, founded in 1977. Through Manifold Productions, he wrote, directed, and produced award-winning nationally broadcast documentaries in addition to corporate and educational films.

4754,"See the confrontation with Dr. Perry: https://youtu.be/xyEl_S6AWkM

Last month, Project Veritas undercover journalists blanketed the state of New Jersey visiting dozens of teacher‚Äôs union offices.  We wondered, how union leaders would react to claims that teachers were physically and verbally abusing students?

What you‚Äôre about to see is a man who is a union president, with a PHD, A LEADER; not working for children like the sign above his head says, but working to what he calls, ‚ÄúBend the truth‚Äù and hide a potential crime.

In this undercover investigation, Hamilton Township Education Association President David Perry details the steps the teachers union would take to protect a teacher who physically abused and threatened middle school students from losing their job.

Dr. Perry says he would misrepresent the events of altercations between teachers and students by back-dating reports and instructed the teacher to not tell anybody about incidents with students.

The union president also stressed that a teacher who abuses his students needs to come to the union after any incident so that they can create a report that would best protect them from students that come forward about abuse.

Veritas will be releasing more undercover videos of teachers unions from ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY in the coming days and weeks. To be alerted as soon as they are published, sign up for our newsletter and check in to www.projectveritas.com frequently for any updates.

Charl van Wyk, author of Shooting Back, talks to WND TV about the African National Congress Firearms Registration Act of 2010 and how that gun control in South Africa has done nothing to stop crime.

What would you do if armed terrorists broke into your church and starting attacking your friends with automatic weapons in the middle of a worship service?

Would you be prepared to defend yourself and other innocents?

Would you be justified in doing so?

Is it time for Americans to consider such once-unthinkable possibilities?

There is one man in the world who can address these questions with firsthand experience.

His name is Charl Van Wyk ‚Äì a South African who was faced with just such a shocking scenario.

In ""Shooting Back: The Right and Duty of Self-Defense,"" Van Wyk makes a biblical, Christian case for individuals arming themselves with guns, and does so more persuasively than perhaps any other author because he found himself in a church attacked by terrorists.

John Dickerson, a co-host of CBS This Morning and contributor for The Atlantic, chats with the magazine's editor in chief, Jeffery Goldberg, about Dickerson's recent cover story and its central question of how the office of the presidency is flawed. 

Trump's admission that the presidency is harder than he expected should come as no surprise. ""This is a common presidential revelation,‚Äù says Dickerson. The pair discusses the emergence of presidential campaigns, the outsized expectations of the American public, and why fixing the presidency is a task that‚Äôs bigger than any one person.

Did Jesus of Nazareth really intend to start a brand new religion called ""Christianity""?

Or, did He come to fulfill that which all of the Hebrew prophets had foretold since the fall of man‚Äîsomething the Holy Scriptures mysteriously and wonderfully call ""the restitution of all things.""

In his newest book, The Restitution of All Things: Israel, Christians, and the End of the Age, veteran journalist and bestselling author Joseph Farah seeks to shed light on what few sermons today teach about, few authors expound upon, and few Bible studies explore: the coming kingdom of God.

4835,"""William Murray provides a unique perspective that should be read, particularly by America's youth, at a time central planners are once again promising utopian dreams at a cost to the most productive among us.‚Äù ‚ÄîGovernor Mike Huckabee

Utopian dreamers are deceived and deceiving. Their ‚Äúfight for the people‚Äù rhetoric may sound good at first, but history proves egalitarian governments, and the cultures they try to create, destroy freedom, destroy creativity, destroy human lives, create poverty and misery, and often spread beyond their borders to bring others under slavery. Utopians believe that through their own personal brilliance a better society can be created on earth. When the belief in man as a creation in the image of God is completely rejected, the use of slavery and mass execution can be justified in the name of the creation of a utopian state for the masses. Pol Pot, Vladimir Lenin, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao Tse-tung‚Äîtogether these so-called visionaries through their fanciful policies are responsible for the deaths of millions of people.

In Utopian Road to Hell, William J. Murray, son of atheist apologist Madalyn Murray O‚ÄôHair, describes the totalitarians throughout history and the current utopians who are determined to engage in social engineering to control the life of every person on earth. From Marx to Hitler, Murray explains the progression of socialist engineering from its occultist roots to the extreme madness of the Nazis‚Äô nationalistic racism. From Margaret Sanger‚Äôs Planned Parenthood and Saul Alinsky‚Äôs Rules for Radicals, the rebellious desire to be free from morality drives the ‚Äúat-any-cost‚Äù campaigns such as abortion on demand, no-fault divorce, same-sex marriage and overreaching government provisions. From Woodrow Wilson‚Äôs ‚Äúliving document‚Äù distortion of the Constitution and his income tax, to FDR‚Äôs New Deal, to Obama‚Äôs executive orders, those who seek centralized power typically do so by proclaiming some utopian scheme that they claim will perfect mankind and eliminate competition, greed, poverty and war.

William J. Murray masterfully educates us on the utopians‚Äô swath of destruction throughout history and warns us of the dangers of present-day utopians fighting to hold power. We must heed the warning of George Washington when he said in his 1796 Farewell Address that it is important for those entrusted with the administration of this great and free nation, ‚Äúto confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another.‚Äù We must reclaim the freedom of the individual to avoid the continued path down the utopian road to hell.

William J. Murray is the chairman of the Religious Freedom Coalition in Washington, D.C. For more than three decades he has been at the forefront of social conservatism. He has appeared on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News, and authored hundreds of columns which have appeared online and in print. Author of eight books, Murray continues to work for the rights of Christians in America and persecuted Christians around the world.

4863,"Maxime Lacoste-Lebuis and Maude Plante-Husaruk ((http://husaruk.com), both filmmakers, were researching their upcoming trip to Central Asia when they first heard a man named Ra√Ømberdi talk about plants. ‚ÄúWe stumbled upon a French TV program about [Tajikistan] where Ra√Ømberdi had briefly appeared, and we immediately thought he was a very interesting man and that there was definitely more to his story,‚Äù Lacoste-Lebuis told The Atlantic. 

Months later, the pair arrived in Tajikistan through the deserted region of the Pamir Mountains. ‚ÄúWe started inquiring about the old Kyrgyz man who had built his own hydroelectric power station,‚Äù Lacoste-Lebuis said. They didn‚Äôt know his name, or even whether he was still living. But they got lucky: A German researcher happened to be traveling through the remote area at the same time. He pointed the filmmakers in the right direction.

Lacoste-Lebuis and Plante-Husaruk‚Äôs short documentary, The Botanist, is an elegant, meditative portrait of Ra√Ømberdi, his culture, and his life‚Äôs work. Ra√Ømberdi descends from a tribe that lived a nomadic lifestyle in a particularly hostile environment. ‚ÄúTherefore, they were completely dependent on the fauna, flora, and climate of the region,‚Äù Plante-Husaruk said. 

‚ÄúOld Kyrgyz people knew how to use plants to make herbal remedies for pains and aches,‚Äù Ra√Ømberdi says in the film. ‚ÄúI discovered everything about roots, stems, leaves, flowers, etc., and how to use them ‚Ä¶ Each plant accumulates organic substances its own way.‚Äù  Read more: https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/576898/botanist/

4881,"Campus Reform Digital Reporter Eduardo Neret asked young voters about President Trump's recent executive orders to suspend student loan payments and cut payroll taxes. Do the voters think these are good ideas? Do they think Trump is trying to help struggling Americans?


STORY: Campus Reform recently asked young Americans about President Donald Trump‚Äôs recent executive orders to suspend student loan payments and cut payroll taxes, which were aimed at helping struggling Americans during the coronavirus pandemic.

Most were surprised to hear about Trump‚Äôs efforts. Even though most people Campus Reform spoke with were not Trump supporters, many admitted he was helping Americans.

‚ÄúI mean, I‚Äôm not really all about President Trump, but, the part of funding schools to giving us money while in this crisis, in this whole pandemic, it did help,‚Äù one student said while referencing the CARES Act.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs shocking in a way because, like, I also don‚Äôt like him, so it‚Äôs shocking that he did that,‚Äù another person added. ‚ÄúAnd I think it does change kind of my view on what he‚Äôs done throughout the pandemic.‚Äù

Campus Reform also asked people if they feel Trump is trying to help Americans during the pandemic.

‚ÄúI know with these measures, it does seem like he wants to help,‚Äù one person said.

‚ÄúWhat he did recently was good for us,‚Äù one student added. ‚ÄúI mean...we‚Äôre struggling students and a lot of people, it‚Äôs not just us.‚Äù

‚ÄúDefinitely he‚Äôs trying to help,‚Äù another individual said. ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs trying to help.‚Äù

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

Though U.S. agricultural exports to China fell one-third in May due to trade war tensions, exports have recently surged beyond expectation due to the flooding of 433 rivers across China.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that pork, corn, wheat, cotton, rice, sorghum, and soybean exports to China from July 10 to 16 reached $32.9 billion, the Phase I annual rate as negotiated in January by the Trump Administration.

Donald Trump ran for President promising to close the $419.2 billion trade goods deficit by decreasing China‚Äôs $539.5 billion in exports to the United States with tariffs and increasing America‚Äôs $120.3 billion in exports to China. At the time, China‚Äôs average tariff on U.S. products was 8%, while the U.S. average tariff on China was 3.1%. 

When the two parties called for a Phase 1 truce on Jan. 15, China had more than doubled its tariff rates on U.S. goods to 20.9%; but the Americans had spiked tariff rates on Chinese goods by seven times to 21%. The two-year deal required China to increase U.S. manufacturing, energy, and service purchases by $120 billion, but also required China to increase annual U.S. agricultural imports from $24 billion in 2017, to $32.9 billion in 2020, and $44.8 billion in 2021.

However, China blamed the pandemic for its failure to significantly increase U.S. agricultural imports, running merely at a $12 billion annual rate through the month of May, which is about a third of the level agreed upon in Phase I.

It is estimated that 45.2 million Chinese have already been affected by floods in 27 provinces along the Yangtze River, Huai River, and Yellow River. When Southern China was hit with a record-breaking 30-hour continuous rainfall reaching 16.8 inches beginning on July 4, China‚Äôs Meteorological Administration rolled out a ‚ÄúNo. 1 Flood‚Äù warning. 

With China‚Äôs heavy rainfall season running about 46% more severe than normal, and 17% more severe than the devastating floods of 1998, about 20% of the nation‚Äôs farmable land is now submerged. According to market analyst firm Seeking Alpha, this could lead to major crop loss this year, with rice, rapeseed, and cotton being the most affected. Moreover, the African swine fever pandemic, which caused 180 million infected pigs to die out last year, has returned as floods reached shallow graves and contaminated groundwater.

With no alternative nation capable of addressing the scale of its potential food security crisis this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that China bought 1.365 million tons of American corn on July 10. The large transaction was followed on July 14 with a single-day record purchase of 1.762 million metric tons of corn. The USDA added that China has quietly been buying substantial amounts of pork, sorghum, soybeans, and cotton since May.

4981,"For decades, the residents of Maine‚Äôs Kennebec Valley believed that the North Pond Hermit was a myth. According to local lore, a hermit had been living undetected in the woods since the 1980s; every so often, he would break into seasonal cabins to steal food and other resources. But no one could prove the hermit‚Äôs existence‚Äîif he was out there, he had taken great pains to guarantee his isolation.

Then, on April 2013, a man was arrested in the deep woods of Maine. His name was Christopher Thomas Knight. According to societal records, he didn‚Äôt exist. For 27 years, he had camped out in the forest, surviving on meager supplies he‚Äôd burglarized from houses in the area. He endured winter temperatures of ‚Äì20¬∞ F. Every morning, he watched the sun rise over the foggy valley he called home. He hadn‚Äôt had a single conversation with another person for nearly three decades.

A series of bonds issued by the Qing government a century ago are once again questioning the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist regime that is now in a difficult dilemma it can not get out of. The market value of the bonds is worth $1.6 trillion USD, and if the CCP wants to prove itself to be the legitimate government of China, then it has to pay back these bonds. If the CCP refuses to acknowledge this debt, then it must recognize that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is the legitimate government of China. 

Recently, Americans who hold the ‚ÄúHukuang Railway Bond‚Äù‚Äîissued by the Qing Dynasty to the United States, Britain, France, and Germany to raise funds for the construction of the Huguang Railways that run from Hunan to Guangzhou‚Äîinitiated a movement demanding the Chinese Communist Party repay the debt. The chairman of the American Bondholders Foundation (ABF), Jonna Bianco, said: ‚ÄúThese bonds were originally issued under the Republic of China, what we know today is Taiwan. And the Communist regime who went in and took over mainland China and became the official government in 1949. It becomes their responsibility to honor this debt. The CCP, Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs debt, just as they paid Great Britain in 1987 for the very same bond. It is successor government doctrine.‚Äù

However, the CCP has always refused to cash in on bonds held by Americans. It selectively defaulted, deliberately not repaying the money owed to American investors.

As early as 1973, before the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China, the U.S. representative told the CCP during negotiations that although the debt does not have to be repaid immediately, the U.S. will not exempt it. Although the CCP government claims to be the only legal government in China and has the right to inherit the sovereignty of Hong Kong left by the Qing government, it does not recognize the right to inherit the ""Hukuang Railway Bonds"" issued by the Qing government.

Bianco said that the previous U.S. administrations did not attach any importance to the issue of the Huguang Railway bond, but President Trump is different from them. ‚ÄúThank God for President Donald J. Trump, who is listening to this issue. I have met with him personally. He has committed his support behind this issue. He is the only president that has held China accountable to play by the same rules, to have fair trades, to have as he said perfectly, reciprocity, and that‚Äôs what Americans expect, that‚Äôs what the world expects,‚Äù she said.

According to data from the US Treasury Department, as of May 2020, the CCP holds US $1.08 trillion in US Treasury bonds. Bianco suggested that the Trump administration exchange bonds with the CCP, that is, use the Hukuang Railway Bonds to repay the U.S. Treasury bonds held by the CCP. Bianco said that she is confident that this matter will succeed.

 Nowhere was this more evident than during the tragic death of a U.S. ambassador in Libya that was lied about for nine days, because the press and the administration did not want to admit it was a terrorist attack.

Join Epoch Times senior investigative reporter Joshua Philipp as he explores the known facts surrounding the CCP virus and the global pandemic it caused.

In his investigation, Philipp explores the scientific data, and interviews top scientists and national security experts. And while the mystery surrounding the virus's origin remains, much is learned about the CCP's cover-up that led to the pandemic and the threat it poses to the world.

Editor‚Äôs note on update to documentary

From the start of the virus outbreak in China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has not been forthcoming with information about the virus. In the early days of the outbreak, medical professionals who sounded the alarm were reprimanded by police for spreading ""rumors.""

Initially, the CCP said the virus originated at the Huanan Seafood Market, even though it knew patient zero had no connection with the market. Fearing that it might be held accountable for the worldwide pandemic, the CCP shifted its narrative to suggest that the virus originated in the United States and was brought to China by the U.S. military.

As a leading voice in covering China for the past 20 years, we understand very well the CCP's deceptive nature and its history of cover-ups. With this outbreak, we saw a case of history repeating itself‚Äîin 2003, we exposed the CCP's cover-up of the SARS epidemic in China, far ahead of other media.

In this documentary, we present viewers with the known scientific data and facts surrounding the origin of the virus along with experts‚Äô opinions. We don't draw conclusions, but we point out that serious questions remain about the origins of the virus as well as the CCP's handling of the outbreak.

Some of our viewers felt the #documentary was taking a position on the origin of the virus, which was not our intent. The documentary has been slightly updated as of April 14 to better reflect our position, which is not to provide a definitive answer, but rather to present the known facts.

5026,"In a WND TV interview, Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue, and co-author of the book, Abortion Free, talks about how any ordinary person with a phone and a computer can close down the abortion clinic in their community using the step by step guide provided in the new manual, Abortion Free.

Abortion is murder. There is no way around it. You can try to justify it by claiming the health of the mother, but the truth is only a small percentage (less than one-tenth of 1 percent by some counts) of the 1 million baby-killings in the United States each year are to save the mother's life. Instead statistics suggest that 85 percent of all abortions are performed as a means of birth control and are three times more likely to be by a woman on Medicaid. Family planning and abortion clinics in the United States are a $2 billion a year industry with a 1.3 percent growth over five years, with 40 percent of all the country's abortions being performed at Planned Parenthood.

For years we have been told that legal abortions were necessary for the health and well-being of the mother. It is a lie. Dr. Bernard Nathanson, co-founder of the National Abortion Rights Action League, who later became a Christian pro-life activist, admitted that his group lied about the number of women dying from illegal abortions.

Thanks to people like Dr. Nathanson, Troy Newman, Cheryl Sullenger, Abby Johnson (former Planned Parenthood worker) and Lila Rose (undercover pro-life activist), the truth is out: Abortion clinics, by and large, are seedy, dirty, nefarious profit centers that don't care a lick about the woman or her rights. They are all about turning a quick buck. Just look at Dr. Kermit Gosnell in Philadelphia. He cut the spinal cords of live babies with scissors. Dr. Douglas Karpen in Houston twisted the heads off of live babies. Another clinic threw remains on its roof to avoid hazardous waste removal fees. Another clinic used a garbage disposal. It is becoming widely known that abortion is a barbaric practice that needs to be stopped. In January 2014, Gallup found that 64 percent of Americans support outlawing abortion in the second trimester and 80 percent support outlawing it in the third. Public opinion is moving in the direction of fewer and safer abortions.

Over the past two decades, Troy Newman and Cheryl Sullenger have honed their skills at exposing abortionists as the snake-oil salesmen they truly are, and in doing so have closed dozens of abortion clinics. People ask why we should close abortion clinics. Because when abortion clinics close, babies are saved! And it stops the infliction of human misery upon vulnerable women and their innocent babies.

In ""Abortion Free,"" Newman and Sullenger recount many stories from the front lines in the battle for life and the successes they have had in closing these houses of horror. It is possible to shut down these repugnant establishments. They walk you through the steps they took to closing down the clinic of one of the nation's most notorious late-term abortionist, Kansas's own George Tiller. Emergency hospitalizations, negative public opinion, health and professional complaints and more brought the heat upon Dr. Tiller's practice. But it was the unwavering pressure by the tenacious pro-life group Operation Rescue, founded by Newman and Sullenger, that finally sealed the deal.

Newman and Sullenger share their more than 50 years of combined experience in shuttering dirty, life-threatening clinics. In this practical manual you will learn how to:

Find out who the abortion doctors are in your community,
Know if abortionists in your community have a record or are even licensed in your state,
Get clinic workers to help you acquire evidence,
Alert the press of criminal activities,
Expose dirty and sundry clinic conditions,
Inform the public and our community leaders of what is taking place, and
Help the women in need.

How do you close abortion clinics? Newman and Sullenger tell you how in plain language in ""Abortion Free."" You will learn what you can do to help close your local abortion clinic and make America ""Abortion Free.""",1,WorldNetDaily

Disastrous floods in southern China are severe, affecting nearly 34 million people, and at least 27 provinces and cities. Some residents were critical saying that several reservoirs were opened simultaneously at midnight without the public's knowledge. In addition, the Fenghuang (Phoenix) ancient town in Hunan Province was hit by heavy rain at the end of June. While residents were busy rebuilding after the flood, the CCP's state-run media reported that the river in the ancient town was surrounded by mist and looked like a fairyland.

On July 12, Chinese Chairman Xi Jinping admitted that ""the flood control situation is very serious."" In She County, Huangshan City, Anhui Province, many rivers‚Äô water levels have risen, and have been flooding villages, bridges, urban areas, and crops. Economic losses are difficult to estimate.

On July 10, a tea manufacturer owner in She County, Anhui Province, couldn‚Äôt help crying after all 3,000 tons of tea leaves were soaked in water. Mr. Wu said that this owner suffered a lot of losses, but there were many other victims who were not reported.

Mr. Wu said that seeking compensation from the government won‚Äôt work if only one or two people speak out. People need to all speak up.

The CCP mouthpiece media Chinanew.com viewed it differently regarding the disastrous floods. The report said that on July 1, the Tuojiang River in the Phoenix ancient town was covered with mist, as if it were covered with a white gauze. The video showed that lots of tourists were on the bridge, taking photos in the thin water mist, and there were pedestrians on the arch bridge, as if they were in a ""fairyland."" However, looking at the video uploaded by a netizen on July 11, the arch bridge was still flooded at both ends, and pedestrians cannot pass over it at all.

They are planning to move the production of non-woven fabric, the raw material for facial masks, from China back to Japan in order to increase the local productivity of facial masks. On April 9, the Japanese government declared that it has $2.2 billion U.S. dollars in funding to assist Japanese companies returning from China and resettling in Japan or other countries in Southeast Asia.

On the same day, the Director of the United States of Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, suggested that the U.S. should help pay for the costs related to the relocation of those American companies that want to leave China. Eric Brown, a senior researcher at Hudson Institute, said, ‚ÄúJapan is seriously thinking about how to best position its economic recovery and to bring about the benefits of geopolitics. The United States of American should do the same.‚Äù

Economist Stephen Moore from The Heritage Foundation expressed, ‚ÄúMany CEO‚Äôs and companies are moving forward now without any kind of government assistance because they don‚Äôt think China is reliable and trustworthy any longer, and ‚ÄúMade in China‚Äù is just not a saler in the United States anymore, and so there are a lot of forces that are moving towards bringing it home ‚ÄúMade in the U.S.A.‚Äù

In addition to the reassessment of supply chain management, the U.S. Financial Sector is also now re-examining the risks of Chinese companies listed on the stock market. On April 21, the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision, Jay Clayton, the Chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, William Duhnke, and 3 other individuals issued a joint statement warning investors of the financial risks of Chinese companies.

Due to the lack of transparency in the financial reports of Chinese companies over the past years, it is very unlikely that the investors will be compensated when things go wrong. Experts believe that this CCP virus pandemic has urged countries to rethink the risks of dealing financially with China and the importance of decentralization with China. Senior Director of The National Interest, Harry Kazianis, said,‚ÄúAs you see more of these supply chains leaving China going back to the U.S., back to other countries, they are going to have less of a reason to say nice things and do nice things for China, and I think you will see things change pretty quickly after that.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Conflict is What Sells,‚Äù Explains CNN Media Coordinator Christian Sierra, ‚ÄúCreate Clicks, Get More Money.‚Äù

(WASHINGTON, D.C.)  On Monday, October 14, 2019 Project Veritas released the first of its Expose CNN series about the inner workings and candid observations of CNN employees and executives as captured with a hidden camera by CNN Insider Cary Poarch.  The first report was followed by Part II in the series on Tuesday, October 15, 2019 where Cary had casual conversations inside CNN regarding the candidates for the Democratic nomination for President. 

Today, we are releasing Part III exposing the network‚Äôs movement away from objective newsgathering and towards partisan advocacy.

According to James O‚ÄôKeefe, President of Project Veritas, ‚ÄúCNN has made a conscious decision to focus almost exclusively on the impeachment of President Trump at the expense of covering legitimate news around the world.‚Äù  

CNN Coverage Used to Be Different
According to CNN insider Cary Poarch, ‚ÄúI want to chase the facts, like the motto that CNN put out earlier this year, ‚Äòthe facts first,‚Äô that's what I want the news to be. That's what it should be. That's what it used to be.‚Äù  It appears a number of CNN staffers agree:

Patrick Davis, Manager of Field Operations at CNN: ‚Äú‚Ä¶I hate seeing what we were and what we could be and what we‚Äôve become. It‚Äôs just awful‚Ä¶I mean, we could be so much better than what we are‚Ä¶And the buck stops with him (Zucker).‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt listened to a 9AM call in about 15 years. I just stopped,‚Äù complains Manager of Field Operations at CNN Patrick Davis, ‚ÄúJust, I can‚Äôt listen to it. It‚Äôs all bullshit. It‚Äôs all just a bunch of bullshit. And I wish that wasn‚Äôt the case.‚Äù

Scott Garber, Senior Field Engineer at CNN: ‚ÄúWe used to cover news. We used to go out and do stories‚Ä¶But Trump is more important.‚Äù

Adia Jacobs, CNN Technical Operations Supervisor: ‚ÄúWhen Zucker took over it wasn‚Äôt until Trump that we ended up being all Trump all the time.‚Äù

Nick Neville, CNN Media Coordinator: ‚ÄúHe (Zucker) basically said f**k all the other stories.‚Äù

Mike Brevna, Floor Manager at CNN: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Trump Network, dog. It‚Äôs like everything is all Trump‚Ä¶they not even thinking about anybody else. They sold themselves to the devil.‚Äù 

Gerald Sisnette, Field Production Supervisor at CNN: ‚ÄúThis is a story that‚Äôs not gonna go away‚Ä¶The only way this will go away is when he (Trump) dies. Hopefully soon.‚Äù

Patrick Davis, Manager of Field Operations at CNN: ‚ÄúAnd you learn it in journalism school, we‚Äôre supposed to be middle of the road, that‚Äôs our job. Now it‚Äôs just infotainment is all it‚Äôs become. There is no true media news outlet.‚Äù

Undercover video reveals covering ‚Äòconflict‚Äô increases the network‚Äôs income (creating clicks) and CNN, under network President Jeff Zucker‚Äôs direction, has become the ‚Äòall Trump all the time‚Äô network. 

Jeff Zucker, CNN President: ‚ÄúSo, my point here is, I know there‚Äôs 7,000 impeachment stories that ‚Äì Look, I am the one that‚Äôs saying we should just stay on impeachment, but when, you know, when a story of this magnitude comes up (referring to the story of alligators and snakes in a moat and shooting immigrants in the legs) and you can objectively say, you‚Äôre out of your mind. You should do it and say you‚Äôre out of your mind.‚Äù

Christian Sierra, CNN Media Coordinator: ‚Äú‚Ä¶conflict is what sells, nobody wants to hear one-minute canned statements‚Ä¶Because conflict drives clicks‚Ä¶create clicks, get more money.‚Äù

Poarch concludes: ‚ÄúI want CNN and any other outlet to basically return to what they once were, where hey, we tune in to get our facts. We can make up our minds left, right, center, whatever. Cool, and we go on with our lives. I don't want anyone to basically, you know, be spun into believing or programmed into believing one way or the other. That's not what I'm about and that's why I'm coming forward.‚Äù

5160,"A Wuhan man in his 40s and in good health developed symptoms after chatting with a neighbor who had recently been discharged from a COVID-19 treatment facility. The man then experienced a mild fever and coughing. He later passed away. 
-
Wuhan Resident:
People in Wuhan, be careful! Be careful! I have a cousin who just passed away last night. He had a neighbor who just came back from a makeshift hospital a few days ago. He went over to chat with the neighbor. After that he felt like he had a cold two days later. He thought he had a cold. He also had a little cough, and yesterday he had a slight fever. Then, all of a sudden, he passed away last night! 

Be careful, guys. (As I just said), He has already died! What‚Äôs the point of looking for a driver to help him! It only took one hour. He told his sister that he was feeling a little sick. An hour later, when his sister called to check on him, it was the doctor who answered, saying he had already died. The doctor asked the sister to come and bid him farewell. But the sister didn't dare go. The doctor told her that if she didn‚Äôt come, her brother would be cremated the next day. He didn't even have a chance to go to the hospital. He just called his sister at 11 o‚Äôclock last night and said he wasn‚Äôt feeling so well. It only took one hour. He had a cough and a slight fever. He thought it was a cold, he was saying he had a cold. He was in his 40s. He was in good health.

Chinese state media have made a fanfare praising Wuhan‚Äôs makeshift hospitals, assuring Chinese people that all patients released from these hospitals have fully recovered. State media even emphasized that all patients must test negative twice before being discharged.

A woman in Mudanjiang videotaped herself describing the situation in the city. She revealed that many people are now jobless and have almost exhausted their savings. 
-
In this shopping mall, the majority of stores are closed.
There are no visitors here.
A while ago we suffered the first round of the pandemic, and now we are experiencing a rebound from the imported cases‚Äî
which is just as tough as the first wave.

The past five months are just too difficult for us.
Most people have little savings left.
Business owners have very few customers and their employees have become jobless.      

We have to pay our mortgage and car loans.
We have to support the elderly and children in the family.
I don‚Äôt know much about the situation of others.
For myself, I stay away from expensive products and only pick cheap or discounted commodities when I go grocery shopping.
I have more expenses than earnings during these months.
I really don‚Äôt know how much longer we can survive.  

Even if I am willing to leave my hometown to find a job, it will be impossible.
First, we must undergo quarantine if we go to another place.
People outside Heilongjiang province definitely won‚Äôt hire anyone from Heilongjiang.
Another issue is that now we are transitioning from Spring to Summer and temperatures fluctuate a lot.
We are too afraid to get ill because we just cannot afford to become ill.  

I just want to say that I really hope our seniors can have a comfortable retirement life, kids can have a happy childhood and resume school sometime soon, and young people like us can continue our careers without having too many worries. 

So please be kind to us Heilongjiang residents.
We really cannot hold along much longer. 

In April, several clusters of the CCP virus outbreak emerged from hospitals in Harbin and Mudanjiang‚Äîtwo major cities in northeastern China‚Äôs Heilongjiang province. This indicates that people living in those areas are now suffering from a second wave of the CCP virus pandemic.

5189,"‚ÄúWell, you know, you are saying undocumented, meaning they came in illegally,‚Äù President Donald Trump responded to a reporter on Wednesday about ‚Äúundocumented immigrants"" not getting a stimulus check from the government as part of the coronavirus economic rescue package.",1,Breitbart News
5190,"The Epoch Times received a report dated April 10th on the statistics of people from Daowai District of Harbin City who tested positive via serology tests. The statistics showed that the CDC (Center for Disease Control) in that district reported 34 cases of positive tests that day. However, the local government reported only one additional confirmed case, amounting to a total of 2 confirmed cases and 4 asymptomatic infected cases. There are 18 districts and counties in Harbin City and if the virus infection grows in proportion to the population, there should have been about 467 people infected by the CCP virus, 14 times higher than the 34 confirmed cases in Daowai District and 233 times more than the data (2 cases) published by the Chinese Communist Party.

Citizen Ms. Deng from Harbin City said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt watch state-run media ,but I know, from online influencers, that there are possibly 182 epidemic centers around Harbin City. These are dangerous places, and I feel extremely scared because I live very close to these dangerous places.‚Äù

A factory owner from Harbin City, Mr. Kang, indicated that many stores and factories are closed down because there are no sales and owners are still required to pay rent during the pandemic, and the government has no economic relief plan for them.

‚ÄúThe pandemic here is severe. My factory is closed for 3 months now and just when I was about to reopen the factory, the epidemic came back again. I have lost so much money since the factory is rented and the workers are not working. There are some factories that cannot even afford the rent and, therefore, closed down. Especially the factories that deal with international orders.‚Äù

On the afternoon of April 20th, a man committed suicide by jumping down from Harbin Provincial Hospital. According to the police, they found the man‚Äôs will on his cellphone. In the will, he stated that he‚Äôs been having fevers for 10 years and there was no cure for it. He wanted to commit suicide as a result of this, not because of the CCP virus. People online believe that the will was fabricated by the police for this incident and is absurd and beyond ridiculous. Citizens from Harbin City expressed that the financial burden has increased a lot during the pandemic and the entrances of many communities with confirmed cases are blocked. The government has no moral values and such inhumane actions have led to mental breakdowns.

Ms. Deng said: ‚ÄúThis CCP virus pandemic is so stressful to us, the ordinary people, that we feel like having a mountain on top of us. In my memories, the prices for the vegetables have never been this high, and the wages for workers in three northeastern provinces are very low. When a public health crisis like this happens, all costs for testing, quarantine, and treatments should be covered by the government, not paid by the citizens. So it is just normal to see people committing suicide because they have no way of continuing their lives.‚Äù

Moreover, the statistics report from Daowai District did not show any cases of asymptomatic infections, raising many suspicions.

Currently, 1 million Uighurs are being held in Chinese internment camps, according to estimates cited by the UN and by U.S. officials. While Uighurs have long faced persecution by the Chinese Communist Party, the detainment campaign is unprecedented. In response, many Uighurs have fled their country. 

Washington, D.C., is now home to the largest community of Uighurs in America. However, Uighurs there say that they are still not safe; many report being contacted and threatened by Chinese authorities. In a new documentary from The Atlantic, we hear from Uighurs in the U.S. who are under threat from China.

A rally in Washington supporting the president and calls to overturn the election turned violent. Protesters stormed both chambers of Congress and one was shot before being driven from Capitol Hill. Members of Congress returned to certify Joe Biden as president-elect. Meantime, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube took aggressive, new steps to clamp down hard on President Trump‚Äôs social media accounts. Among other objections, Twitter said President Trump violated policies in his video urging protesters to be peaceful and go home, because he reiterated claims about election fraud. Some welcome Big Tech‚Äôs crackdown; others say it‚Äôs a radical violation of free speech. It highlights a long-simmering battle over the control of information online.

5212,"#CCPvirus #Wuhan #Coronavirus

Prior to the lockdown of the CCP virus's epicenter in Wuhan, there were approximately 5,000,000 people who reportedly left the city. Where did they go? Using a big data analysis method, a research team from the University of Southampton studied the travel patterns of nearly 5,000,000 people traveling abroad from Wuhan before it was locked down.

On March 23, state-run media reported that Italy's first two confirmed cases of infection were from a Chinese couple. They both recovered after being hospitalized for 49 days. The wife, Hu Yamin, is a faculty member of Central China Normal University, which is located in Wuhan. They left Wuhan on January 22‚Äîa day before the city was locked down. The couple's symptoms began to manifest when they were already in Italy. These findings indirectly acknowledge that it was the Chinese couple who brought the epidemic to Italy.

There was also a lady from Wuhan, who was infected with the virus. She disguised her fever by taking medicine and made the trip to France. She boasted online about it while taking a photo of herself at a Michelin-star restaurant.

The first confirmed case in Japan was from a Chinese man in his 30s, who had stayed in Wuhan for a few days during his trip to China before flying back to Japan.  He also took pills to bring down his fever before boarding the airplane on January 6.

On January 28, Sina Finance reports confirmed cases outside China, were predominantly transmitted by travelers from Wuhan. In fact, 5,000,000 people left Wuhan before the regime imposed its lockdown policy. Commentator Tang Jingyuan believes that the CCP's concealment of the outbreak during its initial spread, caused the world to miss the opportunity to contain the virus.

Commentator Tang Jingyuan: ""The Communist regime did all it could to fully cover-up the facts about the virus. That's the ultimate reason why this infection has spread so quickly in Wuhan, a city with a dense population. It also led to the spread of virus to the rest of China and even the world, as there is a larger number of carriers and patients among the 5,000,000 people who left Wuhan.""

A post from an internet blogger describes the following: Assuming that 1% of the 5,000,000 people from Wuhan traveled abroad, which would come out to 50,000 people. If the CCP virus (formerly known as COVID-19) has a disease incidence of 10%, there will be 5,000 Wuhan virus carriers outside China. 
 
Assuming each country takes 50 Wuhan patients, based on the transmission potential ‚ÄúR0"" (Pronounced ‚ÄúR naught‚Äù) of 4, at the duplication rate of 14 days, there will be a minimum estimated 800 infections in a month. That alone would be scary.

China affairs analyst Xue Chi: ""This epidemic began in Wuhan. Wuhan is the epicenter. It's a fact you can't deny.""

Researchers from the University of Southampton conducted a travel model network-based study and assessed the risk of the CCP virus's spread. In the article published on February 4, it showed the analysis by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports of nearly 60,000 travelers from Wuhan. Researchers did warn about the virus's further spread within China and the world.

Charl Van Wyk was just an ordinary Christian man until July 25, 1993 - the day that would become known as the St. James Massacre. It was on this date that Van Wyk shot back at the terrorists who were attacking an innocent congregation gathered in prayer, and saved many lives in the process. More than just a remarkable story of courage under fire, Shooting Back deals forthrightly with the consequences of his actions, while addressing the concerns that plague so many God-fearing people in these lawless times, such as: Should we carry arms? When is it appropriate to defend ourselves and our families? What can we do when our God-given right to self-defense is legislated away from us? In Shooting Back, Van Wyk tackles these difficult questions using the light of Scripture and insights from his own experience to make the case for self-defense.",1,WorldNetDaily

A mainland Chinese journalist and freelance columnist Chen Jieren, suspected of alleging that Hunan province's Shaoyang city party secretary Deng Guangyan was involved in a major corruption cover-up, was convicted of ‚Äúpicking quarrels and provoking trouble, extortion, illegal business operations and bribery.‚Äù He has been sentenced to 15 years in jail. His younger brother Chen Weiren was also sentenced.
Guiyang county court in Hunan province announced on April 30 that it convicted Mr. Chen of ‚Äúpicking quarrels and provoking troubles, extortion, illegal business operations, and bribery‚Äù and fined him 7 million yuan ($990,000). His brother was sentenced to four years in prison for ‚Äúpicking quarrels and provoking troubles‚Äù and ‚Äúextortion and blackmail‚Äù charges, and was fined 10,000 RMB ($1,400). An associate, Liu Min, was exempted from criminal penalties after being convicted of ‚Äúpicking quarrels and provoking troubles.‚Äù
Chen Jieren published an article online on June 25, 2018, accusing Deng Guangyan of gross misconduct and malfeasance. Mr. Chen went missing over the following days and was later confirmed to be in criminal detention with the police.

Mr. Guo, a Hunan netizen, said: ""According to the Constitution, he is not guilty. They should not even arrest him. The reality is that if there is anything against their interests, they will find a reason to punish you. The judging criteria of the CCP is not the Constitution and the criminal law, buThe court claimed that since 2015, Chen Jieren has used the alias ""Internet Big V"" to publish false or negative information online, to maliciously exaggerate certain mass incidents, to attack and defame the CCP, the judicial organ, and its staff, to instigate troubles, and to extort public and private property. 

t its political purpose and political needs. They are beating the dog before the lion and putting the fear of God into Chinese people by giving Mr. Chen a severe punishment.""

A Hunan netizen said that the official media reported that Chen Jieren had hundreds of millions of dollars in assets. The court did not confiscate all of his property. He did not appeal either, which means he was probably forced to compromise and plead guilty.

Mr. Xie, a Hunan netizen, said: ""Some of his posts are very sharp, but after a while, they are gone. He has exposed too many things. He attacked the secretary of the CCP. Even his brother was implicated, as well as his ex-wife. During the investigation process, he and his family were all in silence. He didn‚Äôt even appeal. I think he compromised. ‚Äù

It‚Äôs reported by the Chinese Human Rights Defenders that Chen Jieren graduated from Tsinghua University Law School and had worked for several state media outlets, including Southern Weekend, China Youth Daily, Beijing Daily, and People‚Äôs Daily, and published over 2,000 commentary articles. Chen was fired from China Youth Daily in 2003 for uncovering a prostitution ring involving students at Wuhan University, causing a scandal; he was demoted as editor-in-chief of China Philanthropy Times for criticising a government portal in 2006; and in 2011, he was sacked from his position in at People‚Äôs Daily Online‚Äôs Jiangsu Window for ‚Äútoo much criticism of the government.‚Äù

Shrier is the author of ""Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters"" and is a contributing writer at the Wall Street Journal.

BUY SHRIER'S BOOK HERE: https://www.amazon.com/Irreversible-Damage-Transgender-Seducing-Daughters/dp/1684510317/ref=sr_1_1?k

Shrier argued the most powerful institutions -- including social media and education -- impose the idea that transgenderism as an inherently good thing. This is particularly harmful for young women in partnership with the politically correct consensus that being a white person carries negative qualities such as racism and superiority.

""The transgender identity is the only one they can choose,"" Shrier said. ""It has really celebrated online. They can't choose to change their race. They can't even to become gay. It is so celebrated online and in the school system.""

‚ÄúIt's not that you can't do good work here,‚Äù said Andy Block, who, since 2014, has served as the juvenile-justice department‚Äôs director. ‚ÄúBut the place itself and the design and the size and the location are barriers to doing good work.‚Äù Block and others are working to close Bon Air and replace it with something that reflects the juvenile justice reforms that have taken hold in Virginia and across the country‚Äîa system that once focused on confinement is now dedicated to rehabilitation. In recent years, more than 70 percent of Virginia's juvenile inmates were rearrested within three years of their release.*

*This documentary originally stated that Virginia has one of the highest recidivism rates in the country. This characterization was based on incomplete data. The documentary also stated that the three-year rearrest rate for current Bon Air inmates would be 74 percent. This was the rate for former juvenile inmates in Virginia in 2014. We regret the errors.

5355,"Former Vice President Joe Biden made his Breakfast Club debut Friday morning in an interview that centered around issues disproportionately impacting black Americans. But the conversation became heated when Breakfast Club Host Charlamagne the God challenged the presumptive Democratic nominee on his dedication to the black community. Biden‚Äôs frustration was palpable; so much of his political persona has been built on his geniality and sincerity, particularly to black voters during the Obama years and beyond. But his attempt to prove his commitment to black Americans‚Äîas well-meaning as it may have been‚Äîled to him reciting tired stereotypes and altering his voice to sound more ‚Äúdown‚Äù for black audiences, a distracting move that threatened to render any salient point he was making moot.

5378,"SUBSCRIBE TO THE PODCAST HERE: https://ricochet.com/series/federalist-radio-hour/

On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Matthew Garnett, host of the podcast ‚ÄúIn Layman‚Äôs Terms‚Äù joins Executive Editor Joy Pullmann to discuss the New York Times‚Äôs ‚ÄúNice White Parents‚Äù podcast and the effects of racial stereotyping on parenting, education, ideology, and more.

‚ÄúWe are erasing the concepts and modes of life that gave that give rise to our ability to be free, happy people. And part of that project is the people who created this podcast,‚Äù Pullmann notes.

Garnett and Pullmann also explore if the basis of the arguments in the ‚ÄúNice White Parents‚Äù podcast that seemingly take issue with race might actually be more than skin-deep.

‚ÄúIt is also important to keep in mind when we talk about whiteness and blackness that they‚Äôre also talking about ideology,‚Äù Garnett said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just that these kids with white bodies are coming into our school. There is the white ideology, Western liberal capitalism, that is coming into our schools.‚Äù

While Pullmann and Garnett both agree that this race-based movement has the potential to turn into a much bigger problem when ideology comes into play, Garnett anticipates that the revolutionary tendencies demonstrated by it will not last forever.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very hopeful that enough people- across all socio-economic lines, racial groups, whatever- I‚Äôm very hopeful that they see this, and that there‚Äôs enough of it going on that, when push comes to shove, it‚Äôs gonna be okay. It‚Äôs gonna be okay,‚Äù he said.

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

5443,"‚ÄúWhy would an Israeli Jew choose to live in the West Bank?‚Äù

That‚Äôs the question that motivates writer Wajahat Ali to travel to Israel in a new documentary from The Atlantic. Ali, who has been critical of Israel, embarks on a personal quest to understand the perspectives of some of the 400,000 Israeli Jews who live in the occupied territory in defiance of international law‚Äîand to hear from the Palestinians who oppose them. 

In his travels through the West Bank, Ali visits the family of a Palestinian terrorist, ventures into the heart of one of the most radical settlements, and speaks to the leader of an NGO focused on creating a dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians.

Read Ali's article in the June 2018 issue of The Atlantic: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/a-muslim-among-the-settlers/559145/

5488,"Growing up, Teena Faison never imagined she‚Äôd find herself a single mom and homeless. So at 34 years old, she decided to change her ways and go to Solutions for Change, a nonprofit for homeless families in Vista, California.

Instead of simply providing a place to sleep, Solutions for Change takes a holistic approach to solving homelessness. It requires residents to go through counseling, take courses in financial literacy, parenting, leadership, and anger management, and eventually, get a job.

Over the past 17 years, Solutions for Change has gotten 1,200 families off government assistance and back on their feet. But because it requires residents to adhere to certain accountability standards such as staying sober, Solutions for Change is ineligible to receive federal government program funding. As a result, they have foregone $600,000.

The Daily Signal's Kelsey Harkness visited the homeless non-profit to learn more about why it chose to keep the drug-free policy instead of accepting taxpayer dollars.

For more on the organization featured, visit solutionsforchange.org

Dr. Haikal claimed that he and his protesters were ""against all killing in Egypt"" and that they were not in support of Morsi and/or the Muslim Brotherhood; however all the posters surrounding him said differently.  Dr. Haikal's organization appears to be a part of the ""Anti-Coup/Pro-Democracy"" group holding protests worldwide.  Despite what they're trying to say about 'bipartisanship', they are definitely supporters of Mohammed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood.

On today's edition of Federalist Radio Hour, constitutional scholar John Yoo joins Ben Domenech for a conversation on his new book, ""Defender in Chief: Donald Trump's Fight for Presidential Power."" While the left casts Trump as a threat to the Constitution, Yoo argues the president is actually helping to restore it. It's the left, Yoo contends, that poses a bigger threat to constitutional norms than Trump.

Yoo is the Emanuel S. Heller Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. 

His book is available here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0818NBZXD/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0

In eastern China‚Äôs Anhui Province, many places were purposely flooded to divert water from the Yangtze River. The logic behind the water diversion is that, even the biggest city of Anhui, the capital city Hefei, is less developed than Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai, the three metropolitan cities along Yangtze River. 

Chinese state media claimed that Anhui residents willingly sacrificed themselves to make a contribution to the nation, and praised their altruism. While China‚Äôs internet trolls supported and magnified this ‚Äúpositive energy‚Äù propaganda, flood victims‚Äîincluding a local TV anchor‚Äîexpressed their anger and despair in front of cameras. 

By July 23, at least four towns in the province were completely inundated in water, 200,000 people lost their homes and farm land.

5545,"Since everyone is talking about Baltimore, Daniel gives you a glimpse of what it's like to live there. Baltimore is the perfect cesspool of sanctuary policies, weak on crime and tough on self-defense, plus the war on police. This is what happens when the essence of the governing compact is terminated. The Left wants every city to turn into Baltimore. 

He then gets into the national lawlessness of illegal immigration. He's joined by Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb to discuss how the entire country will become like Baltimore if we continue importing the cartel smugglers into our country. Even though Pinal County is not quite on the border, it is the last line of defense against many of the bad people who come in. Sheriff Lamb tells him his county has to pay for huge amounts of the cost of medical care for those smuggling in drugs and cartel members! Moreover, there is a large Indian reservation that has become a magnet for cartel activity being shunted into his county. 

Daniel's bottom line: If we don‚Äôt secure our border, even those cities that clamp down on local crime (unlike Baltimore) will have to deal with other countries' criminals who are as violent as can be.

The same can be said about white supremacy and the oppression it deploys against people of color across the word. All oppression is local.

There are few public intellectuals more capable of drawing oppressed people together around a clear message of unified, anti-imperialism than Temple University Professor Marc Lamont Hill. There are few subjects Hill can‚Äôt engage in with a razor-sharp precision and moral clarity. He is called on to discuss the failures of domestic policy and how those failures perpetuate racism.

How much did the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) know about the virus before telling the world? How much did they suppress? What really led to this crisis that has devastated economies and caused mass suffering around the world. What can be done for the future?

The world should have known about the severity of the outbreak in Wuhan much earlier. The global spread of the disease could have been prevented. The CCP's actions during the early stages of the outbreak were, and still is, the Coverup of the Century.

5565,"As much of the world now sees the United States with disdain and distrust, it is time for us to take a cold, hard look at what we have become. John Adams said, ‚ÄúOur Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.‚Äù We have strayed from our clear moral beginnings to become an egotistical culture that glorifies self. We try to set our own standards despite Thomas Paine‚Äôs warning that ‚Äúman cannot make or invent or contrive principles. He can only discover them, and he ought to look through the discovery to the Author.‚Äù

As our society celebrates injustice against people who stand for their convictions, it‚Äôs hard to forget the words of John Adams who wrote, ‚Äújustice is a great Christian as well as moral duty.‚Äù With the decline of virtue in so many areas of our culture ‚Äì from twerking on stage to cheating scandals at universities to corporate theft by aggressive bankers ‚Äì we should take heed of George Washington‚Äôs warning that ‚Äúliberty, when it degenerates into licentiousness, begets confusion, and frequently ends in tyranny or some woeful catastrophe.‚Äù

""Liberty‚Äôs Secrets"" exposes readers to the Founding Fathers as never before. They believed in God, Judeo-Christian values and the freedom and necessity of religion in order to have a free and prosperous society. They believed in a free press and knew, as John Adams argued, that ‚Äúwhen a people is corrupted, the press may be made an engine to complete their ruin.‚Äù They believed in a limited government, strong education and private property.

""Liberty‚Äôs Secrets"" is like having a front-row seat to the congresses and conventions where these leaders hashed out the profound issues of life and society. Charles has cataloged all of the Founding Fathers' writings, and ""Liberty‚Äôs Secrets"" provides an expos√© of their profound yet glossed-over insights, delving into the subjects most important to maintaining a free society at a time when we most need to recover them. In so doing, ""Liberty‚Äôs Secrets"" equips readers to use the Founders' knowledge and understanding to neutralize the cultural myths currently undermining American liberty.

It is hard not to wonder whether catastrophe is upon us. If ever there was a time to grow up as a nation, now is the time. It is time to recover the morals and moorings of our Founders. It is time to rediscover ""Liberty‚Äôs Secrets.

The Bible predicts that in the last days a charismatic leader will establish a global following in the name of peace. Islamic prophecy also predicts that a man will rise up to lead the nations, pledging to usher in an era of peace. Islam‚Äôs savior is called the Mahdi. However, the man in the Bible is the Antichrist. Joel Richardson‚Äôs stunning research and analysis suggest that the Mahdi and the Antichrist may actually be one and the same. In ""The Islamic Antichrist,"" Richardson exposes Western readers to the traditions of Islam and predicts that the end times may not be far away. Richardson‚Äôs revelations will stun readers who are unaware of the similarities between the Antichrist and Islam‚Äôs expectations about a returning Jesus. His explanation of the relationship between Christian end-time prophecy and Islamic expectations of world domination has shocked readers and revolutionized eschatological expectations for a generation.

Davis is a four-term member of the House of Representatives from Alabama, where he represented the 7th District as a Democrat from 2003-2010.  He was viewed as a rising star in the House, and named in 2008 by Esquire magazine as one of the ""Ten Best Congressmen in America.""  He was the first congressman to endorse Barack Obama for president, and even seconded his nomination in 2008. But he has since switched to the Republican Party, and even spoke at their convention in August. Davis is now a columnist and commentator across a wide media spectrum: He contributes to Politico and National Review, among others.  He is a Current Fellow at Harvard's prestigious Institute of Politics, and is an attorney in Washington, D.C.",1,Accuracy in Media

At the end of the show, we discuss how the Trump administration is risking its entire legacy by not fighting more aggressively against judicial supremacism. If it continues to give force to these illegal rulings, it will erase all the progress at the border in recent months.

5603,"""William Murray provides a unique perspective that should be read, particularly by America's youth, at a time central planners are once again promising utopian dreams at a cost to the most productive among us.‚Äù ‚ÄîGovernor Mike Huckabee

Utopian dreamers are deceived and deceiving. Their ‚Äúfight for the people‚Äù rhetoric may sound good at first, but history proves egalitarian governments, and the cultures they try to create, destroy freedom, destroy creativity, destroy human lives, create poverty and misery, and often spread beyond their borders to bring others under slavery. Utopians believe that through their own personal brilliance a better society can be created on earth. When the belief in man as a creation in the image of God is completely rejected, the use of slavery and mass execution can be justified in the name of the creation of a utopian state for the masses. Pol Pot, Vladimir Lenin, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao Tse-tung‚Äîtogether these so-called visionaries through their fanciful policies are responsible for the deaths of millions of people.

In Utopian Road to Hell, William J. Murray, son of atheist apologist Madalyn Murray O‚ÄôHair, describes the totalitarians throughout history and the current utopians who are determined to engage in social engineering to control the life of every person on earth. From Marx to Hitler, Murray explains the progression of socialist engineering from its occultist roots to the extreme madness of the Nazis‚Äô nationalistic racism. From Margaret Sanger‚Äôs Planned Parenthood and Saul Alinsky‚Äôs Rules for Radicals, the rebellious desire to be free from morality drives the ‚Äúat-any-cost‚Äù campaigns such as abortion on demand, no-fault divorce, same-sex marriage and overreaching government provisions. From Woodrow Wilson‚Äôs ‚Äúliving document‚Äù distortion of the Constitution and his income tax, to FDR‚Äôs New Deal, to Obama‚Äôs executive orders, those who seek centralized power typically do so by proclaiming some utopian scheme that they claim will perfect mankind and eliminate competition, greed, poverty and war.

William J. Murray masterfully educates us on the utopians‚Äô swath of destruction throughout history and warns us of the dangers of present-day utopians fighting to hold power. We must heed the warning of George Washington when he said in his 1796 Farewell Address that it is important for those entrusted with the administration of this great and free nation, ‚Äúto confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another.‚Äù We must reclaim the freedom of the individual to avoid the continued path down the utopian road to hell.

About the Author

William J. Murray is the chairman of the Religious Freedom Coalition in Washington, D.C. For more than three decades he has been at the forefront of social conservatism. He has appeared on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News, and authored hundreds of columns which have appeared online and in print. Author of eight books, Murray continues to work for the rights of Christians in America and persecuted Christians around the world.

On September 3, the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II, leader of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Xi Jinping made a speech that caused a stir on the Chinese internet.

Xi spoke about five things that ‚ÄúChinese people will never agree to,‚Äù which ignited uproar among netizens who believed Xi had no right to speak on behalf of the Chinese populace.

Meanwhile, some China commentators analyzed that Xi was sending a subtle message to the international community about their growing criticism of the Chinese regime.
-
The U.S. embassy in China has announced that ambassador Terry Branstad will retire and leave Beijing early next month. 

Branstad, 73, is a former governor of Iowa. He first forged ties with President Xi Jinping several decades ago when Xi visited Iowa.

Last week, Branstad tried to publish an article in China‚Äôs ‚ÄòPeople‚Äôs Daily‚Äô titled ‚ÄúResetting the Relationship Based on Reciprocity.‚Äù The ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Daily‚Äù refused to publish it. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, it shows how much the Chinese regime fears ""their own people‚Äôs free-thinking"" and the ""free world‚Äôs judgment"" about their governing practices inside China. 

Pompeo said Branstad‚Äôs contributions will have ‚Äòlasting, positive effects on U.S. foreign policy‚Äô for decades to come.
-
At the end of August, 12 Hong Kongers were arrested by the CCP‚Äôs maritime police while trying to flee to Taiwan by sea. They were detained secretly for more than 20 days. On September 13, the Yantian Branch of the Shenzhen Municipal Public Security Bureau announced that the 12 people had been under criminal detention on suspicion of illegally crossing the border. These 12 people, including ‚ÄúHong Kong Story‚Äù member Li Yuxuan and other Hong Kong youths who had participated in the anti-extradition movement, were intercepted by the Guangdong Coast Guard on their way to Taiwan on August 23 and detained in the Shenzhen Yantian Detention Center.

On September 11, the U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo stated that The United States is ""deeply disturbed that Hong Kong democracy activists, arrested two weeks ago, have been denied access to lawyers of their choice. We hope Chief Executive Lam‚Äôs stated commitment to protecting the rights of Hong Kong residents is more than just words.""

5644,"Most poisonous mushrooms won‚Äôt kill you‚Äîthey‚Äôll simply cause a severe headache or vomiting. Death-cap mushrooms are not like the others. As little as half an Amanita phalloides contains enough toxin to kill an adult human. Ingestion of the poison in death-cap mushrooms, known as amatoxin, is responsible for 90 percent of deaths related to mushroom poisoning worldwide. Worse still, death caps can resemble nontoxic mushrooms and are said to be quite tasty. You might not know you‚Äôve been poisoned until days after eating the highly toxic fungi. 

While the mushrooms are historically endemic to Scandinavia and parts of northern Europe, the cultivation of non-native species of trees in North America has led to a ‚Äúmushroom boom‚Äù in some areas of the continent.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve opened Pandora‚Äôs box,‚Äù the author Craig Childs says in a new animated video from The Atlantic. ‚ÄúThere is no way you can stop them.‚Äù For more information, read  ‚ÄúDeath-Cap Mushrooms Are Spreading Across North America"": https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/02/deadly-mushroom-arrives-canada/581602/

5651,"This week on Full Measure, drug cartels are recruiting thousands of juveniles  in Mexico and the U.S. because the feds usually let them go. But many of the  kids end up brutalized by the cartels. We investigate how one border town is taking a hard line approach to stop juvenile trafficking. Plus, Senators are blocking legislation through a secretive practice that‚Äôs supposed to be banned. We talk to Senator Chuck Grassley about his fight to stop so-called ‚Äòsecret holds.‚Äô And - why some claim rising seas are actually threatening our military. These stories and more, this week on Full Measure.

5652,"The recent Capitol Hill hearings of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh may have been the biggest flashpoint of the #metoo movement to date.  The hearings raised the question of standards, in the #metoo era.  Are women to be believed  based solely on an unproven allegation? If corroboration is required, then what's good enough? And who gets to decide?  Those are some of the tricky questions raised by abuse allegations made against a top Democrat official Congressman Keith Ellison by an ex-girlfriend who spoke to Sharyl this week.

5687,"Federalist Co-founder Sean Davis slammed legacy media Tuesday night after NBC News attempted to strip The Federalist of its Google ad revenue by collaborating with a left-wing British think tank to complain to the tech giant about Federalist reporting.

‚ÄúNBC, the network that coddled Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer by the way, had partnered with a foreign left-wing group in Europe to go after us and to use Google,‚Äù Davis said on Fox News‚Äô ‚ÄúTucker Carlson Tonight.‚Äù

On Tuesday, NBC News reported a story that Google banned The Federalist, along with the website ZeroHedge, from generating ad revenue based on a report by the network‚Äôs ‚Äúverification unit‚Äù created with the UK‚Äôs ‚ÄúCenter for Countering Digital Hate‚Äù complaining about the two websites exposing the mainstream media‚Äôs deliberate lying over recent protesting that has gripped the nation without citing the stories in question.

Google later released a statement debunking NBC‚Äôs reporting. Google said The Federalist had not been demonetized but that it was threatening to introduce sanctions on the website over third-party content in its comment sections. Davis told Tucker Carlson that in response, The Federalist has ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù removed its comment section on pieces but pledged ‚Äúthey will be back.‚Äù

‚ÄúHere we have a foreign unit, NBC that with the Orwellian name the ‚ÄòNBC News Verification Unit,‚Äô the irony there is enough to make you laugh, seeking with another left-wing foreign group to de-platform an American media organization,‚Äù Davis said, after all kinds of allegations of electoral interfering by foreign entities were raised in the aftermath of 2016. ‚ÄúIf this were a just world there would be accountability for that. There would be accountability for fake journalists who go around trying to destroy their competition for the crime of criticizing them.‚Äù

Davis emphasized that while The Federalist is a large enough website to weather the storm of big tech censorship, smaller groups don‚Äôt have the power to defend themselves from the left-wing cancel mob.

‚ÄúWe have a big audience, we have a lot of influence, we were able to stop this,‚Äù said Davis. ‚ÄúNow most people, 99.99 percent of people who get cancelled or de-platformed by these little Marxist cry bullies, they don‚Äôt have any recourse and it‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening to them that‚Äôs the real crime.‚Äù

5724,"WND TV interviews Dr. Paul Kengor about his new book Takedown:
From communists to progressives, how the left has sabotaged family and marriage.

We are witnessing a watershed moment in American cultural history: the sabotaging of family and marriage. Extreme-left radicals have made their arguments and tried different tactics, from the early nineteenth century to the sexual revolution of the 1960s, but at long last they have the vehicle to make it happen: gay marriage. Now, as the legal definition of marriage rapidly changes, the floodgates are open, and the fundamental transformation of the American family will take on new speed and new dimensions. Efforts to redefine the family structure have been long at work, and there have been some influential forces on the far left and communist left that cannot and should not be ignored in that process.

In ""Takedown"" Paul Kengor exposes these origins, starting with Karl Marx, and traces them through the sordid history of people like Margaret Sanger, Wilhelm Reich, Herbert Marcuse and assorted '60s radicals. What were once fringe concepts have become accepted by mainstream thought and are today welcomed by many legislators and judges. Kengor notes how in the not-so-distant past, today's leftists who are attacking traditional marriage would have loudly raised their voices but not caused any real damage. They would have been dismissed with no serious concern as left-wing cranks, crackpot German and Austrian atheistic philosophers and campus agitators. But now, with formal legalization of same-sex marriage afoot, they are getting what they‚Äôve wanted for generations: the literal redefinition of the family.

""Takedown"" exposes how gay marriage is serving as a Trojan horse for the far left to secure the final takedown of marriage that it has long wanted, and countless everyday Americans are oblivious to the deeper forces at work. ""Takedown"" takes no prisoners and bluntly shows the reader that even Karl Marx and his more anti-marriage comrade Engels would be dumbfounded at the mere thought that modern Americans would gladly join them in their rejection of God's design for natural marriage and the family.

Atlas is a fellow in scientific philosophy and public policy at Stanford University‚Äôs Hoover Institution, a member of Hoover‚Äôs Working Group on Health Care Policy, and the former head of Neuroradiology at Stanford Medical School.

Atlas laid out multiple points of scientific evidence indicating the necessity of reopening schools. This included the documented facts that children are young people are at low risk of developing COVID-19 themselves and they‚Äôre at low risk of spreading it to others.

Furthermore, he said, school closures are extremely harmful to children‚Äôs health in different ways, especially in that distance learning has proven to be a failure.

‚ÄúThere is nothing more important to the United States than educating our children. It is an absolute urgent top priority. And when you say those three things, there is no argument to keep schools closed. None,‚Äù he said.

Videos shared by a resident who lives in the neighborhood show several open bins with flames coming out of them. People were seen throwing things into the flaming bins. 

Police and firefighters arrived in response to reports of a fire, but were not allowed to enter the Chinese Consulate. 

Two weeks later, a similar incident was caught on video by NTD TV‚Äôs cameraman on Aug. 6. In front of the Chinese Consulate in New York, two USA Shred trucks kept shredding documents for two hours. A couple of Chinese employees and a security guard were overseeing the shredding. They all appeared to be particularly vigilant.

While more than half of China's provinces continue to suffer from floods due to torrential rains, many parts of northeast China are experiencing the worst drought in recent history. In Fuxin City and Jinzhou City of Liaoning Province, large areas of crops have been wiped out and trees are dying due to lack of water. 

On July 30, The Beijing News reported that two months before the corn is harvested in October, the blazing sun drained the moisture from the leaves in the cornfields of Fuxin City, Liaoning Province. Most of the corn leaves rolled up and turned into pieces as soon as they were twisted by hand. The report said that this summer is the driest summer in the region since 1951.
Not only Fuxin City, but Jinzhou City, Yingkou City, Huludao City, Chaoyang City, Panjin City, Shenyang City, and Tieling City have all experienced severe dry weather. According to a report, nearly 700,000 people are affected by the drought in Jinzhou City. 

Drought also happened in Inner Mongolia and farmers also harvested no crops. Despite many provinces suffering from droughts, many places in China suffered from attacks of locusts and southern China suffered great floods. Both disasters pose great threats on crops that are harvested in autumn.

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

As the Chinese Communist Party continues to intensify its disinformation war‚Äîsuggesting that the CCP virus originated in the United States‚Äîseveral young overseas Chinese have decided to openly declare their standpoint in apologies posted online.

-
#1
I am pigsty purification. I want to say sorry for America. Sorry for bringing the Chinese Virus to the U.S.. Sorry for being silent about what the CCP has done to conceal the truth and benefit the dissemination of the Wuhan Virus. Sorry for selfish buying in bulk. Sorry for spreading misinformation via WeChat, saying the American army brought the virus to Wuhan. It‚Äôs wrong.

Sorry for any inconvenience of the virus. I also feel sorry for Japanese, Koreans, Taiwanese, and other Asians who are wrongly recognized and treated as Chinese. I am a Chinese. I am responsible for all bad things that Chinese and the government have done. Like Germans still say sorry to Jewish people for the genocide. Now the virus is killing more than that genocide. The biggest fault is to allow the CCP to lie and then we don't stand out to oppose it. It is our fault.

I know that Chinese Exclusion is happening. It is inescapable. I fully understand the hatred towards Chinese. Essentially, If my family and I are innocent to get involved with this virus, because of the evil regime. And meanwhile, I see many Chineses dare support that regime. I would hate Chinese more than others. As a Chinese, I think our race group should not step back from the duty and just saying that Chinese people are not the CCP members.

I know a lot of Chinese living in America, having Green Cards and espousing the Chinese government. They are vested interests.

We should say sorry for every innocent person who is influenced by the Chinese virus. I think the Chinese government should pay the cost, and pay the huge amount of compensation to Americans.

I hereby launch a movement #saysrytoAmerica.

-
#2
In the name of Lord Jesus. I sincerely apologize to pneumonia victims infected by Chinese Virus.

I was born in China and am doing research work in the United States.I‚Äôm speaking from a human standpoint that China regime and Chinese people are guilty for surge of the pandemic.

I urge all Chinese whose consciences are unveiled to stand up and apologize for our silence, our arrogance and our deceptions.I urge all Chinese whose consciences are unveiled to confess our sins in the light of God and abandon communism mindset. Communism propaganda exists everywhere in Chinese society.

A number of Chinese people either tempted by Chinese Communist Party with economic interests or threatened by CCP with arbitrary detention. Communism mindset is a trade with devil, trading the truth conscience to get money and temporary safety. We have many concerns of our personal benefits.

However, the surge of pandemic has proved that the truth should be considered with the highest priority. Our silence tolerates Chinese Communism Party to arrest Dr. Li Wenliang. Our silence tolerates Chinese Communism Party to be bribe the world health organization. Our silence tolerates Chinese Communism Party to cheat the world.

As a Chinese, though we are necessarily the party member, we can not evade the guilt. We see the truth as if we never seen. We heard the truth as if we never heard. We keep silence as if we never knew the deception. I confess in the name of Lord Jesus. I‚Äôm sorry.

As coronavirus outbreak is hitting all over the world, thousands of people have died of that, thousands more get infected every day. At the initial stage of the virus outbreak, what the Chinese government did was trying to hide the truth from the public. It took disciplinary actions to all the whistleblowers, including doctor Li Wenliang, who tried to convey the genuine message to other people. 

This virus originates from China. There is no doubt of it. 

As a Chinese, I feel sorry (that) we have such an evil communist regime who didn‚Äôt take people‚Äôs lives seriously. 

As Chinese, we are sorry we let this evil regime live for 70 years. Because we have this regime, not only we have the virus, we had Tiananmen Square massacre, we have forced labor in concentration camps, where millions of Uyghurs are forced to gather there. 

Even today, the Chinese government is still trying to do the same thing‚Äîhiding the truth. 

I encourage all the government and all the people of the world (to) take combined action to hold the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese government responsible for this virus outbreak. This government, this evil Chinese Communist Party must be overthrown.",1,The Epoch Times

However, studies within the last few years have shown that Zoomers are far more fiscally conservative than millennials. For example, numerous polls have found Zoomers to be the most entrepreneurial generation to date. An incredible 54 percent of Gen Z say they want to start their own business.

""When you talk about the independent pizzerias, they really are my heroes,"" Schnatter said. ""Papa John's started in the back of a broom closet, so I love a little guy and I'm a fighter for the independent pizzeria, all the way to the bank.

 ""That's what bothers me about COVID is it's been really hard on small business in the small business owners,"" Schnatter said, expressing hope that many pizzerias will be able to make a financial comeback.

Corporations promoting things like diversity in race, gender, and sexual preference, Schnatter said, can be good if it's not just for show, but many times diversity of thought is not accommodated by those same companies.  

""The problem with corporate boards is they're very weak,"" Schnatter said

""Collaborative confrontation in the line of question is to make other people better or make society better,"" he added. ""I think that's really good and healthy and I think that's what's made America, America, and the thought of shutting that down because somebody doesn't think the way I do or I don't think the way they do is basically taking away our first amendment rights.""

The founder and CEO of both Twitter and Square, Dorsey is a billionaire several times over. As he surely knows, his companies owe their success to the free market system. It makes little sense to defend Twitter and Square, and remain a multibillionaire, while also supporting an explicit, anti-capitalist vision. Dorsey either believes the $10 million gift is a worthwhile public relations expense, doesn‚Äôt fully embrace Kendi‚Äôs project, or wants to create a world in which his own companies wouldn‚Äôt exist.

Green indicates a person who has never been infected and has no contact history with potential virus carriers.
 
Many people who are holding the green barcode feel happy about this identification system, thinking it is equivalent to a certificate of health. However, a Chinese woman realized that this system makes civilians more vulnerable to China‚Äôs inhumane epidemic control measures.

5917,"Hanukkah contains one of the most amazingly detailed revelations of the end times ‚Äì Jonathan Cahn opens up the endtime mysteries of Hanukkah, with stunning detail on what is yet to come ‚Äì and what is already happening right now before our eyes!

Most people are somewhat familiar with the Hanukkah story as related in the Book of Maccabees, an extrabiblical history of Israeli rebellion against a Greek tyrant who desecrated the Temple. They know the story of the lighting of the menorah and the miracle of the oil that burned beyond any reasonable expectation. But even Bible scholars and Christians knowledgeable about the Hebrew Roots of their faith don't know about the ancient endtime mystery revealed in the story of Hanukkah.

Jonathan Cahn is the author of ""The Harbinger,"" the No. 1 bestselling Christian book in America in 2012 ‚Äì a book that stayed on the New York Times bestseller list longer than any other title. He's also the inspiration for ""The Isaiah 9:10 Judgment,"" the No. 1 faith movie of 2012. Now, in partnership with WND Films which produced ""The Isaiah 9:10 Judgment,"" he is releasing some of his finest teachings, delivered at conferences and at his own New Jersey congregation, the Beth Israel Worship Center in Wayne, N.J. If you liked ""The Harbinger"" and ""The Isaiah 9:10 Judgment,"" you will love the rich and abundant biblical teachings of messianic rabbi Jonathan Cahn.",1,WorldNetDaily

Huang Wanli (1911-2001), a renowned Chinese hydraulic engineer known for his strong opposition of the Three Gorges Dam project, pointed out that the biggest design flaw of the dam is its inability in flood control.
 
In a recent interview with NTD TV, Huang‚Äôs son Huang Guanhong said if both the upstream Chongqing City and the downstream Wuhan face the risk of flooding in summer, the authorities will have to choose between sacrificing Chongqing or Wuhan. In other words, there is no way both cities can be saved.

Chongqing issued a red flood alert on June 22, and Wuhan issued a red alert on July 15. China will likely face the worst scenario this year‚Äîboth cities are badly inundated.

Mission Statement
Investigate & expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical & transparent society.

Core Values
MORAL COURAGE - Courage is the virtue that sustains all others. We choose to overcome our fears.

WE ARE ALL LEADERS - Turning people into leaders. Completed staff work. Ownership.

COLLABORATION - Best not to work in silos. No one individual is as smart as all of us.

RESILIENCE - Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Never, ever, ever give up. We don't let mistakes or setbacks discourage us. Pursue perfection, knowing full well you will never attain it.

MISSION DRIVEN - The best people are motivated by purpose. We are passionate and truly believe in our cause. We must be externally focused, not internally focused.

MAKE THE STATUS QUO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE - We move mountains. Failure is not an option. We do whatever it takes.

THE TIP OF THE SPEAR - We are a loss leader. We do not shy away from conflict or litigation.

Ethical Values
Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

5946,"Australia‚Äôs demand for accountability from China received support from other countries, but the CCP responded by threatening Australia with a boycott.

Many countries are demanding reform within the WHO and have called for the CCP to be held accountable for the pandemic. Australia, being one of the most vocal countries, has been threatened by the CCP with a boycott in tourism and foreign trade. The foreign minister of Australia said Monday that he would not submit to the coercion. 

As of April 27, the number of confirmed cases of the CCP virus in Australia reached 6,714, with 83 deaths. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, and Foreign Minister Marise Payne, recently called for the international community to send independent inspectors into China to investigate the actions taken by the Chinese Communist Party since the outbreak of the virus.

Tom Connell, a journalist with Sky News Australia, said: ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs a very united push one for a global independent inquiry into COVID-19. Clearly, they have been focused a lot on the role of the WHO and also the role of China. What the Chinese Communist Party knew and when, and what was done to try to suppress the virus. So perhaps, in cases, what was not done.‚Äù

The Australian Financial Review reported on the 26th that Cheng Jingye, the Chinese ambassador to Australia, said Australia's pursuit of an independent investigation into the coronavirus pandemic was ""dangerous"" and could spark a boycott of students and tourists visiting Australia, as well as sales of popular agricultural products exports such as beef and wine. However, Australia did not back down.

Sky News Australia anchor Laura Jayes said, ‚ÄúThe government is not backing down from a push inquiring into China's handling of coronavirus despite the threat from the Chinese ambassador.‚Äù

On the 27th, Foreign Minister Marise Payne responded to Cheng Jingye, saying that Australia‚Äôs call for an independent inquiry into the CCP virus comes at the right time and is a principled call. She added: ‚ÄúThis is an unprecedented global crisis that has serious health, economic, and social implications. We reject any suggestion that economic duress is appropriate to respond to calls for such assessments. What we need at this time is global cooperation.‚Äù

British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace also expressed his support for the Australian call for an investigation into the CCP virus outbreak inside China. He said that during this ""once-in-a-century"" event, the world needs transparency and every government needs to learn the lessons presented by this event.

5984,"SUBSCRIBE TO THE PODCAST HERE: https://ricochet.com/series/federalist-radio-hour/

On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Ethan Strauss of The Athletic joins Host Ben Domenech to discuss the implications of politicized sports and sports media on viewership numbers. Using the NBA as an example, Strauss and Domenech break down the ‚Äútaboo‚Äù of acknowledging the cultural effects of incidents like the NBA‚Äôs conflict with China and recent Black Lives Matter walkouts on its audience.

‚ÄúI have trouble accepting the premise that the public is deeply invested in what the players are telling them,‚Äù Strauss explains.

In his recent article for The Athletic, Strauss determined that the NBA‚Äôs ratings dropped significantly on many different viewing platforms. On the podcast, Strauss elaborated on this concept, claiming the perception of the NBA‚Äôs viewership performance is viewed differently by the players and sports journalists than the fans watching.

‚ÄúAssumption within the sports media bubble is that it‚Äôs ever-ascending, the NBA, on the way up. Football is a thing of the past, NBA is sort of the future. And meanwhile, in terms of modifiable metrics of interest, it‚Äôs going the completely opposite direction,‚Äù Strauss explained.

‚ÄúOne of the issues here is if entertainment is top-notch, you will set everything else aside. But the idea of what the entertainment is is informed by how it‚Äôs discussed and how it‚Äôs presented and how it‚Äôs marketed and there‚Äôs a certain suspension of disbelief that‚Äôs required for sports. You want to buy into the idea that this is an epic conflict between these two teams, and this really matters a lot,‚Äù Strauss added.

It‚Äôs time to look at more. Glenn Beck connects the dots between the phone call that led to the impeachment of President Trump and why an investigation into Hunter Biden is so important. Ultimately, this was never about Trump. It wasn‚Äôt even about the Bidens. This is about a violation of constitutional power by Barack Obama that will horrify even his most ardent supporters. Glenn pulls back the curtain on the theft of billions in international funds to Ukraine by following the clues in the phone call. Those clues could lead to mountains of corruption, and Hunter Biden might be the lynchpin to uncovering the entire thing.

A recent investigation done by Australian media revealed that the Chinese Communist Party is taking advantage of the loopholes of Australian laws. The CCP secretly recruited dozens of Australian top investigative scholars to join the ‚ÄúThousand Talents Plan‚Äù or other recruitment programs. This news shocked the Australian government. Many federal members have called on the Australian Parliament to conduct an investigation. 

On August 24, The Australian, a broadsheet newspaper published in Australia, revealed a list of 32 scientists, including four non-Chinese scientists, who were recruited by the CCP into the ‚ÄúThousand Talents Plan‚Äù and other similar recruitment programs with high salaries. The research of these scholars covers highly sophisticated fields such as Artificial Intelligence and quantum technology. They are from the top Australian universities and research institutions. While being employed in Australia, they frequently returned to China and applied for patents in China. Some of them have as many as 30 patents.

Li Yuanhua, former associate professor at Capital Normal University, said: ‚ÄúFor instance, there are at least five people from the University of New South Wales on this list. Some of these professors receive 12 million AUD a year in funding from the Australian government. To the CCP, it is like spending a small amount of money to benefit individual researchers who will sell the results of their research for far more money than it offered. To Australia, having a group of scholars like these is simply equivalent to betraying national interests.‚Äù

By May 10, Russia recorded more than 10,000 daily new cases of CCP virus infections for seven days in a row. Many Chinese petrochemical workers in Russia wish to return to China, but they can‚Äôt afford the expensive air tickets. They organized a strike, hoping that Chinese authorities will provide assistance to help them get back home.   

A video released on May 8 showed a huge crowd of workers gathering in a plaza. There is a blue gate-like structure with a Chinese slogan couplet in white stating, ‚ÄúHappily enjoy our work while we are here, return home safe and sound when the job is done.‚Äù

An insider revealed that these workers had been on strike for three consecutive days, but as of now, the Chinese authorities have taken no action to assist them.

The Democrats have a worse glass jaw on the issue of public security than on any other issue. Yet Republicans refuse to punch back on sanctuary cities, their weak-on-crime agenda, too-little use of the death penalty, drugs, gangs, open borders, and self-defense. I discuss the mass murderer illegal alien whom nobody is talking about and how it‚Äôs criminal malpractice for Republicans to ignore it. Instead, they are agreeing to the premise of the Left on guns.

Today, we are joined by Frederick County, Maryland Sheriff Chuck Jenkins, one of the last men who still believe in law and order, to discuss the absolutely horrific knockout attack that occurred at his county fair in broad daylight that resulted in the death of an innocent man.  He believes that we simply are not deterring criminals anymore because of our increasingly weak justice system.

Jenkins is also a leader in the 287(g) immigration enforcement program, which ensures that illegal aliens arrested for crimes are turned over to ICE. He explains how he has successfully removed nearly 1,530 illegal alien criminals, many of them gang members, who are now out of the country and can no longer harm more people. Imagine if every county did that?

Rule #1 ‚Äì Truth is paramount. Our reporting is fact based with clear and irrefutable video and audio content.  Truth is paramount. We never deceive our audience. We do not distort the facts or the context. We do not ‚Äúselectively edit.‚Äù

Rule #2 ‚Äì We do not break the law. We maintain one-party consent when recording someone is inherently moral and ethical. We never record when there is zero-party consent. In areas where we are required to have consent from all parties, we seek legal guidance regarding the expectation of privacy‚Äôs impact on our right to record.

Rule #3 ‚Äì We adhere to the 1st Amendment rights of others. During our investigations we do not disrupt the peace. We do not infringe on the 1st Amendment rights of others.

Rule #4 ‚Äì The Zekman Test. The undercover investigations we pursue are judged by us to be of ‚Äúvital public interest‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound importance.‚Äù The Zekman Test is our baseline. Undercover investigative reporting is necessary because, ‚Äú...there‚Äôs no other way to get the story...‚Äù Whereas the Society of Professional Journalists allows for undercover techniques, if undercover techniques are necessary to expose issues of vital public importance; we believe they are not only allowed but required.

Rule #5 ‚Äì We Protect the Innocent When Possible - Embarrassing private details are not to be investigated. We stay away from irrelevant embarrassingly intimate details about private citizens personal lives. We look for individual wrong-doing and judge its public importance. The irrelevant religious or sexual dispositions of our targets are not to be investigated.

Rule #6 ‚Äì Transparency. Our methods & tactics must be reasonable and defensible. We use the ‚ÄúTwelve Jurors on Our Shoulder‚Äù rule. The work has to be done with such a degree of integrity that it can withstand scrutiny in both law & ethics. We are comfortable with transparency. We must be willing to be ready to disclose our methods upon publication.

Rule #7 ‚Äì Verifying and Corroborate Stories ‚Äì Evaluate impact on third parties and Newsworthiness of Statements Alone.We consistently consider the probable truth or falsity of statements, examine any reasons to doubt the veracity of underlying assertions and whether the assertions are newsworthy. When possible, we will confirm with our subjects that their statements captured on video are accurate & truthful. At the very least, we will give our subjects an opportunity to elaborate and/or respond. In all matters, we rely on the 1st Amendment to protect our ability to publish newsworthy items after our internal deliberations. On whether there is an obligation to ensure the veracity of statements made on video, 1.) consider whether the remarks may potentially impact an innocent third party. (Factors in support of releasing the content) and 2.)The Newsworthiness of the statement alone by itself. (Factors against releasing the content).

Rule #8 ‚Äì Raw Video. In certain circumstances we may release the ‚Äúraw‚Äù video to the press and or the public.  But as a rule, we do not.

Rule #9 ‚Äì Subject Anonymity. We investigate & question sources before promising anonymity. Once we confirm, we will do everything in our power to protect the identity of our confidential sources.

Rule #10 ‚Äì Being Accountable. Admit mistakes & correct them promptly.

Rule #11 ‚Äì We do not manufacture content. We do not put words in our investigative subjects' mouths. We do not lead the horse to water. Our purpose is to elicit truth.

Rule #12 ‚Äì With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.",1,Project Veritas

Charl van Wyk, author of Shooting Back, talks to WND TV about ""The most dangerous job in the world: A White Farmer In South Africa"".

What would you do if armed terrorists broke into your church and starting attacking your friends with automatic weapons in the middle of a worship service?

Would you be prepared to defend yourself and other innocents?

Would you be justified in doing so?

Is it time for Americans to consider such once-unthinkable possibilities?

There is one man in the world who can address these questions with firsthand experience.

His name is Charl Van Wyk ‚Äì a South African who was faced with just such a shocking scenario.

In ""Shooting Back: The Right and Duty of Self-Defense,"" Van Wyk makes a biblical, Christian case for individuals arming themselves with guns, and does so more persuasively than perhaps any other author because he found himself in a church attacked by terrorists.

ABOUT:
The First exists for the massive group of Americans whose voices have been ignored. The people who are passionate about American values, aren‚Äôt afraid to engage big ideas, and who care about where the country is headed. The people who are conservative in their views but aren‚Äôt beholden to any party‚Äôs talking points. The independent thinkers who rely on things like the facts, context, and perspective to inform their ideology. The people who, although they form the backbone of this country, have been cast aside by the politicians and the media.

The people whose beliefs and values are increasingly being cancelled. They are why we created The First. You are why we created The First.
 
We‚Äôre the home of free speech, free ideas, and free TV.

6112,"One day after a prominent U.S. Muslim leader reacted to the November 2015 Paris attacks with a declaration that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has nothing to do with Islam, President Obama made the same assertion.

Who exactly is the enemy we face, not only in the Middle East but also within our borders? Is it ""murderers without a coherent creed"" or ""nihilistic killers who want to tear things down,"" as some described ISIS after 130 people were brutally slain and another 368 injured in a coordinated attack on Western soil that authorities say was organized with help from inside France's Muslim communities.

After the Paris attacks, Obama, himself, described ISIS as ""simply a network of killers who are brutalizing local populations.""

But how much do words and definitions really matter? According to the legendary military strategist Sun Tzu, if ""you do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one (battle) and lose one; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.""

When the Department of Homeland Security was founded in 2003, its stated purpose was ""preventing terrorist attacks within the United States and reducing America's vulnerability to terrorism."" The Bush administration's definition of the enemy as a tactic, terrorism, rather than a specific movement, proved consequential amid a culture of political correctness. By the time President Obama took office, Muslim Brotherhood-linked leaders in the United States were forcing changes to national security policy and even being invited into the highest chambers of influence. A policy known as Countering Violent Extremism emerged, downplaying the threat of supremacist Islam as unrelated to the religion and just one among many violent ideological movements.

When recently retired DHS frontline officer and intelligence expert Philip Haney bravely tried to say something about the people and organizations that threatened the nation, his intelligence information was eliminated, and he was investigated by the very agency assigned to protect the country. The national campaign by the DHS to raise public awareness of terrorism and terrorism-related crime known as If You See Something, Say Something effectively has become If You See Something, Say Nothing.

In ""See Something, Say Nothing,"" Haney ‚Äì a charter member of DHS with previous experience in the Middle East ‚Äì and co-author Art Moore expose just how deeply the submission, denial and deception run. Haney's insider, eyewitness account, supported by internal memos and documents, exposes a federal government capitulating to an enemy within and punishing those who reject its narrative.

Haney discloses:

How the Bush administration stripped him and other frontline officers of their ability to define the threat;

How much the Obama administration knew in advance of the Boston Marathon bombing and how it launched an ongoing cover-up on behalf of a major ally;
The administration‚Äôs stealth policy to protect Islamic leaders with supremacist beliefs and violent-jihadist ties, allowing them to freely travel between the U.S. and the Middle East;

The scope of access to the White House and the classified information the Obama administration gave to members of Muslim Brotherhood front groups;

The damning intelligence on Muslim Brotherhood-linked leaders invited to sit at the table and help form national-security policy;

The ""words matter"" memo imposing the demands of radical U.S. Muslims leaders on the DHS, including stripping intelligence and official communications of any mention of Islam in association with terrorism;

The purging of training material that casts Islam in a negative light;

The erasing and altering of vital intelligence on terrorists and terror threats;

The fear-based tactics imposed by the Muslim Brotherhood front groups in the U.S. and their accomplices that paralyze officials, members of Congress and any Department of Homeland Security employee who dares to expose or resist their agenda; and

Much more ‚Ä¶

In this well-documented, first-person account of his unique service with DHS, Haney shows why it's imperative that Americans demand that when they see something and say something, the servants under their charge do something to prevent a cunning, relentless enemy from carrying out its stated aim to ""destroy Western Civilization from within.""

6160,"Abortion is murder. There is no way around it. You can try to justify it by claiming the health of the mother, but the truth is only a small percentage (less than one-tenth of 1 percent by some counts) of the 1 million baby-killings in the United States each year are to save the mother's life. Instead statistics suggest that 85 percent of all abortions are performed as a means of birth control and are three times more likely to be by a woman on Medicaid. Family planning and abortion clinics in the United States are a $2 billion a year industry with a 1.3 percent growth over five years, with 40 percent of all the country's abortions being performed at Planned Parenthood.

For years we have been told that legal abortions were necessary for the health and well-being of the mother. It is a lie. Dr. Bernard Nathanson, co-founder of the National Abortion Rights Action League, who later became a Christian pro-life activist, admitted that his group lied about the number of women dying from illegal abortions.

Thanks to people like Dr. Nathanson, Troy Newman, Cheryl Sullenger, Abby Johnson (former Planned Parenthood worker) and Lila Rose (undercover pro-life activist), the truth is out: Abortion clinics, by and large, are seedy, dirty, nefarious profit centers that don't care a lick about the woman or her rights. They are all about turning a quick buck. Just look at Dr. Kermit Gosnell in Philadelphia. He cut the spinal cords of live babies with scissors. Dr. Douglas Karpen in Houston twisted the heads off of live babies. Another clinic threw remains on its roof to avoid hazardous waste removal fees. Another clinic used a garbage disposal. It is becoming widely known that abortion is a barbaric practice that needs to be stopped. In January 2014, Gallup found that 64 percent of Americans support outlawing abortion in the second trimester and 80 percent support outlawing it in the third. Public opinion is moving in the direction of fewer and safer abortions.

Over the past two decades, Troy Newman and Cheryl Sullenger have honed their skills at exposing abortionists as the snake-oil salesmen they truly are, and in doing so have closed dozens of abortion clinics. People ask why we should close abortion clinics. Because when abortion clinics close, babies are saved! And it stops the infliction of human misery upon vulnerable women and their innocent babies.

In ""Abortion Free,"" Newman and Sullenger recount many stories from the front lines in the battle for life and the successes they have had in closing these houses of horror. It is possible to shut down these repugnant establishments. They walk you through the steps they took to closing down the clinic of one of the nation's most notorious late-term abortionist, Kansas's own George Tiller. Emergency hospitalizations, negative public opinion, health and professional complaints and more brought the heat upon Dr. Tiller's practice. But it was the unwavering pressure by the tenacious pro-life group Operation Rescue, founded by Newman and Sullenger, that finally sealed the deal.

Newman and Sullenger share their more than 50 years of combined experience in shuttering dirty, life-threatening clinics. In this practical manual you will learn how to:

Find out who the abortion doctors are in your community,
Know if abortionists in your community have a record or are even licensed in your state,
Get clinic workers to help you acquire evidence,
Alert the press of criminal activities,
Expose dirty and sundry clinic conditions,
Inform the public and our community leaders of what is taking place, and
Help the women in need.
How do you close abortion clinics? Newman and Sullenger tell you how in plain language in ""Abortion Free."" You will learn what you can do to help close your local abortion clinic and make America ""Abortion Free.""",1,WorldNetDaily

6181,"A company boss told employees that in south China, 80 percent of private companies rely on exports to survive. Now that these companies are losing their overseas customers from Europe and North America, a huge wave of layoffs is foreseeable. 
-
As long as the United States is struggling to combat the pandemic, there will be no improvement for China‚Äôs economy.  Our business model is to produce about 85 to 90 percent of our products for export. In south China, 80 percent of private companies rely on exports, just like our company. How can we ever rely on China‚Äôs domestic demand? All our production is geared for export. 

No export means bankrupt factories. Bankruptcy means the Chinese will become jobless and not have income. It's a chain reaction. Make sense? The current economic situation is very severe. Any company that can still pay regular salaries to its employees is simply outstanding! 

There are currently 74.2 billion yuan ($10.5 billion) of credit card debt and hundreds of billions of yuan mortgage debt that cannot be paid on time. Are you aware of that?

Right now I am paying you basic salaries, and you can pay your mortgages, you are among the lucky ones!

U.S.-based Chinese commentator Wen Zhao pointed out that Chinese leaders gravely erred when obstructing Western countries‚Äô efforts to evacuate their citizens and shut down borders to China. 

Western countries suffered huge losses from the pandemic as a result, both in terms of human lives and economically. Their losses, in turn, would deal a devastating blow to China‚Äôs economy. 

Wen said that in the handling of the pandemic, China‚Äôs top leaders chose the path that would lead to the worst consequence for China itself.

6184,"Staff writer Tristan Justice explains how the media's coverage of Melania Trump and Kamala Harris wearing the same boots perfectly captures the industry's bias.

*****

Trump Derangement Syndrome has infected the fashion industry. On Wednesday, Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris made a bold wardrobe move to sport Timberland boots as she was stepping off a plane in California to tour the fire devastation sweeping across the state she represents in the Senate.

According to Yahoo! Finance, ‚ÄúKamala Harris may have made Timberland boots cool again.‚Äù The site‚Äôs Editor-at-Large Brian Sozzi went on to call Harris‚Äôs shoe choice a ‚Äúboss like move,‚Äù propelling the footwear company by giving the brand some much-needed free advertising.

Other outlets soon followed in their glowing praise of the California senator‚Äôs trendy new look, complimenting Harris for making the fashion-forward footwear judgment on the grueling campaign trail now less than two months from election day.

‚ÄúKamala Harris Wears Timberlands, Gets Sh*t Done,‚Äù headlined Marie Claire, a health, beauty and fashion magazine.

‚ÄúTimbs and Converse? Kamala Harris sports Timberland boots after wearing Chuck Taylor All-Stars,‚Äù titled coverage in USA Today.

‚ÄúKamala Harris‚Äô Timberlands-Pearls Combo Has Our Vote,‚Äù headlined another piece in Refinery29 picked up by Yahoo! Life.

Timberland boots on powerful women however, are by no means a new look, but they are a tasteless one if your last name is Trump according to the latte liberal media.

First Lady Melania Trump was ridiculed for making the same wardrobe decision several years ago.

Guangzhou, in China‚Äôs southern Guangdong Province, is known for its numerous fashion wholesale manufacturing markets. Until recently, more than 100,000 workers from Hubei Province have been employed in garment factories or fashion shops in Guangzhou‚Äôs Haizhu District. However, due to the CCP virus pandemic, the garment industry has lost a large number of customers, and factory and shop owners are struggling to pay their rent. 

On April 21 and 22, business owners in the Haizhu District held protests in the streets to demand rent reductions, only to be met with arrests and suppression by police.

The Chinese-language Epoch Times was able to talk with two garment factory owners and a landlord in the fashion market on April 30.

The interview was conducted on April 30 by Xiong Bin of the Chinese-language Epoch Times.

6223,"Order your copy of The Jefferson Lies from the WND Superstore: http://superstore.wnd.com/search?keywords=Jefferson%20Lies

The American public was nearly deprived of the opportunity to read this book.

In 2012 popular historian David Barton set out to correct what he saw as the distorted image of a once-beloved Founding Father, Thomas Jefferson, in what became a New York Times best-selling book, The Jefferson Lies.

Despite the wildly popular success of the original hardcover edition, or perhaps because of it, a campaign to discredit Barton s scholarship was launched by bloggers and a handful of non-historian academics.

What happened next was shocking virtually unprecedented in modern American publishing history. Under siege from critics, the publisher spiked the book and recalled it from the retail shelves from coast to coast. The Jefferson Lies is thus a history book that made history becoming possibly the first book of its kind to be victimized by the scourge of political correctness.

But more than three years later, it s back as an updated paperback edition in which Barton sets the record straight and takes on the critics who savaged his work.

And that s just part of the story. Why did this book spark so much controversy?

It could only happen in an America that has forgotten its past. Its roots, its purpose, its identity all have become shrouded behind a veil of political correctness bent on twisting the nation's founding, and its Founders, beyond recognition.

The time has come to remember again.

This new paperback edition of The Jefferson Lies re-documents Barton's research and conclusions as sound and his premises true. It tackles seven myths about Thomas Jefferson head-on, and answers pressing questions about this incredible statesman including:

Did Thomas Jefferson really have a child by his young slave girl, Sally Hemings?
Did he write his own Bible, excluding the parts of Christianity with which he disagreed?
Was he a racist who opposed civil rights and equality for black Americans?
Did he, in his pursuit of separation of church and state, advocate the secularizing of public life?
Through Jefferson's own words and the eyewitness testimony of contemporaries, Barton repaints a portrait of the man from Monticello as a visionary, an innovator, a man who revered Jesus, a classical Renaissance man, and a man whose pioneering stand for liberty and God-given inalienable rights fostered a better world for this nation and its posterity. For America, the time to remember these truths is now.

6238,The U.N. ambassador plans to host a ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù reception ‚Äî inviting countries who voted against the General Assembly‚Äôs Jerusalem resolution. This comes after 128 countries backed a resolution calling for the U.S. to withdraw its decision to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But Haley also asserted the U.S. will not be pushed around.,1,LifeZette
6239,"Depression is a multifaceted and insidious disorder, nearly as complex as the brain itself. As research continues to suggest, the onset of depression can be attributed to an interplay of the many elements that make us human‚Äînamely, our genetics, the structure and chemistry of our brains, and our lived experience. Second only, perhaps, to the confounding mechanics of anesthesia, depression is the ultimate mind-body problem; understanding how it works could unlock the mysteries of human consciousness.

Emma Allen, a visual artist, and Dr. Daisy Thompson-Lake, a clinical neuroscientist, are fascinated by the physical processes that underlie mental health conditions. Together, they created Adam, a stop-motion animation composed of nearly 1,500 photographs. The short film illuminates the neuroscience of depression while also conveying its emotive experience.

‚ÄúIt was challenging translating the complicated science into an emotional visual story with scenes that would flow smoothly into each other,‚Äù Allen told The Atlantic.

‚ÄúOne of the most complex issues we had to deal with,‚Äù added Thompson-Lake, ‚Äúis that there no single neuroscientific explanation for depression‚Ä¶While scientists agree that there are biological and chemical changes within the brain, the actual brain chemistry is very unique to the individual‚Äîalthough, of course, we can see patterns when studying large numbers of patients.‚Äù As a result, Allen and Thompson-Lake attempted a visual interpretation of depression that does not rely too heavily on any one explanation.

The film‚Äôs first sequence depicts the brain‚Äôs vast network of neuronal connections. Neurons communicate via synapses, across which electrical and chemical signals are exchanged. In a depressed patient‚Äôs brain, some of these processes are inefficient or dysfunctional, as the animation illustrates. Next, we see a positron emission tomography (PET) scan of a depressed brain, demarcated by darkened areas. Finally, the animation shows activity in the hippocampus and the frontal lobe. Abnormalities in the activity of both of these areas of the brain have been implicated in depression by recent research.

For Allen, one of the main objectives in creating Adam was to help dispel the notion that depression is a character flaw. ‚ÄúA common misconception is that the person is at fault for feeling this way, and that to ask for help is a weakness or embarrassing,‚Äù Allen said. ‚ÄúBut depression has a physical component that needs treating.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe shame surrounding mental health still exists,‚Äù Allen continued. ‚ÄúIn fact, in the case of Kate Spade, it was reported that she was concerned about the stigma her brand might face if this were made public.‚Äù

And who, exactly, is Adam? ‚ÄúDaisy lost a friend to suicide,‚Äù said Allen, ‚Äúso the film is named in his memory.‚Äù

--

""Adam"" was directed by animator Emma Allen and neuroscientist Daisy Thompson-Lake. It is part of The Atlantic Selects, an online showcase of short films from independent creators, curated by The Atlantic.

6240,"Sometimes it seems like the only reason any member of the Real Housewives cast throws a party is so they can get dressed up and fight with an audience. Maybe that‚Äôs why they joined a reality show in the first place.

Viewers saw this play out most recently at Kandi Burruss‚Äôs baby shower on Real Housewives of Atlanta, over comments Kenya Moore made to TMZ about Nene Leakes being a bully with bad wigs. However, a true Housewives fan knows that making a scene in public is just par for the course in Bravoland.

From Real Housewives of New York‚Äôs Aviva Drescher throwing her prosthetic leg across the table, to Taylor Armstrong‚Äôs breakdown at Brandi Glanville‚Äôs beach party on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, these ladies are experts at using screaming matches to bring them right back to the center of everyone‚Äôs attention.

6243,"On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich joined host Ben Domenech to discuss the importance of the Mayflower Compact in 1620 and how what the Pilgrims outlined informs what we know about liberty and rights today.

""They ultimately defined the uniqueness that our rights come from God,"" Gingrich said. 

""Government is, by definition, limited and the Constitution was written to limit government, rather than to limit individuals,"" he added. 

According to Gingrich, these principles of ""American essence"" are seriously threatened when politicians' powers are left unchecked.

""We watched this year the repudiation of the American Constitution on a scale that is breathtaking where local politicians decide that you don't have a right to assemble. You don't have a right to free speech. You don't have a right to worship,"" he said. ""And they do it on a totally random and personalistic basis of what they want.""

""There's a genuine, deep fight underway,"" Gingrich said. ""And my guess is the very arbitrary stupidity of these left-wing governors will increase the anti-government hostility of an amazing number of Americans.""
