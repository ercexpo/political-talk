For decades, commentators have observed the steady erosion of many of these norms, and in the four years of the Trump administration, the trickle of norm violations became a torrent. As a response, many in academia, the media and politics have called for Congress to pass legislation that would codify what had previously been unwritten norms of behavior, from requiring that presidential candidates disclose their tax returns to limiting the president's pardon power.

In a forthcoming article in the Georgetown Law Journal, Jonathan Gould, assistant professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley, analyzes many of these proposals and points out the potential unintended consequences of trying to commit unwritten norms to legislative language.

Minor league players get low pay in general -- often it doesn't meet the equivalent of the federal minimum wage of $7.25/hr -- and players aren't eligible for overtime, no matter how many hours they work.

But if the MLB makes over $10 billion in revenue annually, shouldn't the organization be able to pay its minor league players minimum wage at least?

They should, but the MLB says there's a reason minor league players shouldn't get minimum wage and overtime: they aren't actually employees.

In the wake of his rebuttal to President Joe Biden‚Äôs address to a joint session of Congress, leftists on Twitter began using the hashtag ‚ÄúUncle Tim‚Äù in reference to Scott, the lone black Republican in the Senate.

Democrats, who claim to be the only party to stand up for black Americans, have also reportedly remained silent on using the hashtag ‚ÄúUncle Tim,‚Äù a play on the derogatory racial caricature Uncle Tom‚Äôs name presents black people as subservient.

Scott, the lone black Republican in the Senate, called out the hypocrisy of so-called ‚Äúwoke‚Äù corporate America.

He indicated that while they support BLM, sometimes echoing one of the leftist group‚Äôs favorite slogans, ‚ÄúSilence is violence,‚Äù they stay silent when the political ideology of a victim of racism does not align with the left.

On Friday, Sen. Scott tweeted:

Via Twitter, conservatives, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, ripped the NAACP and BLM for not condemning the racial slur after it was disseminated by liberal critics of the black GOP senator Wednesday, the Daily Mail pointed out.

The racial slur ‚ÄúUncle Tim‚Äù was trending on Twitter for 12 hours unhindered, despite the social media giant‚Äôs policy that bans all forms of racism on its microblogging platform.

Twitter ultimately blocked the hashtag after 12 hours, blaming ‚Äúan algorithm‚Äù for allowing ‚Äú#UncleTim‚Äù to trend for so long,‚Äù the Hill noted.

While Republicans, even Never-Trumpers, hailed Scott‚Äôs response, Biden‚Äôs address received criticism from both parties, potentially fueling the ire against the black senator.

Angering Democrats and their supporters, Scott made headlines by saying, ‚ÄúHear me clearly: America is not a racist country.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs backward to fight discrimination with different discrimination,‚Äù he added before ‚ÄúUncle Tim‚Äù had even begun to pick up steam on Twitter.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve also experienced a different kind of intolerance,‚Äù he later noted. ‚ÄúI get called ‚ÄòUncle Tom‚Äô and the N-word ‚Äî by ‚Äòprogressives‚Äô! By liberals!‚Äù

That comment likely triggered or at least helped to spark the vitriol that followed on Twitter, with leftists doubling down and calling him ‚ÄúUncle Tim‚Äù over and over again.

On Friday, Scott told Fox News;

Last night what was trending in social media was ‚ÄúUncle Tim,‚Äù and they doubled down on this concept of liberal oppression. It is stunning in 2021 that those who speak about ending discrimination want to end it by more discrimination.

The left has‚Ä¶ doubled down that they are going to, not attack my policies, but they‚Äôre literally attacking the color of my skin. You can‚Äôt step out of your lane, according to the liberal elite left.

Leftists on Twitter and Democrat-allied pundits on CNN and MSNBC were also reportedly angry with Scott‚Äôs contention during his rebuttal that he does not believe America is racist despite personally experiencing discrimination.

4335,"On February 1, Myanmar's military overthrew the country's democratically elected government in a coup and declared a state of emergency for a year. It returns Myanmar to full military rule after nearly a decade of quasi-democracy that began in 2011. The coup came just hours before the start of a new session of Parliament, which was expected to endorse the results of a November election where de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party won in a landslide and the military-backed party performed poorly. The military has alleged voter fraud, but Myanmar's election commission has said that there is no evidence to support its claims. Since then, the country has seen daily peaceful protests and large-scale strikes against military rule, at times clashing with security forces who have been seen using tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds. To break it all down, Rohini Kurup spoke with Aye Min Thant, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist based in Myanmar.

IF we would have let those remarks air, the four MILLION people who watched our YouTube video yesterday may not have been able to watch President Trump speak at CPAC on our network.

Recently, CBN founder Pat Robertson talked with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo here in our studio about these multiple threats, and his concerns that President Biden is reversing the progress made by the Trump administration.

""Peace through strength,"" Pompeo recommends. ""When an administration is viewed as weak it creates real opportunities for these bad guys around the world.""

Pompeo played a key role in fostering the historic Abraham Accords peace deals between Israel and Arabic nations. He questions if the new administration will continue to build on the progress the Trump administration made in the Middle East.

Domestically, the discussion turns to the crisis on the border caused by the Biden administration's reversal of Trump policies and the dangers of pending legislation such as the Equality Act, which threatens religious freedom. Democrats are also pushing a voting reform act that inserts the federal government into nationwide elections and appears to be part of a multi-pronged strategy to ensure a long-term Democrat grasp on power.",1,cbnnews

9243,"Republicans criticized Black Lives Matter (BLM), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and corporate America for refusing to condemn the ‚ÄúUncle Tim‚Äù slur to black Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) that surfaced Wednesday and went viral on Twitter.

In the wake of his rebuttal to President Joe Biden‚Äôs address to a joint session of Congress, leftists on Twitter began using the hashtag ‚ÄúUncle Tim‚Äù in reference to Scott, the lone black Republican in the Senate.

Democrats, who claim to be the only party to stand up for black Americans, have also reportedly remained silent on using the hashtag ‚ÄúUncle Tim,‚Äù a play on the derogatory racial caricature Uncle Tom‚Äôs name presents black people as subservient.

Scott, the lone black Republican in the Senate, called out the hypocrisy of so-called ‚Äúwoke‚Äù corporate America.

He indicated that while they support BLM, sometimes echoing one of the leftist group‚Äôs favorite slogans, ‚ÄúSilence is violence,‚Äù they stay silent when the political ideology of a victim of racism does not align with the left.

On Friday, Sen. Scott tweeted:

Via Twitter, conservatives, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, ripped the NAACP and BLM for not condemning the racial slur after it was disseminated by liberal critics of the black GOP senator Wednesday, the Daily Mail pointed out.

The racial slur ‚ÄúUncle Tim‚Äù was trending on Twitter for 12 hours unhindered, despite the social media giant‚Äôs policy that bans all forms of racism on its microblogging platform.

Twitter ultimately blocked the hashtag after 12 hours, blaming ‚Äúan algorithm‚Äù for allowing ‚Äú#UncleTim‚Äù to trend for so long,‚Äù the Hill noted.

While Republicans, even Never-Trumpers, hailed Scott‚Äôs response, Biden‚Äôs address received criticism from both parties, potentially fueling the ire against the black senator.

Angering Democrats and their supporters, Scott made headlines by saying, ‚ÄúHear me clearly: America is not a racist country.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs backward to fight discrimination with different discrimination,‚Äù he added before ‚ÄúUncle Tim‚Äù had even begun to pick up steam on Twitter.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve also experienced a different kind of intolerance,‚Äù he later noted. ‚ÄúI get called ‚ÄòUncle Tom‚Äô and the N-word ‚Äî by ‚Äòprogressives‚Äô! By liberals!‚Äù

That comment likely triggered or at least helped to spark the vitriol that followed on Twitter, with leftists doubling down and calling him ‚ÄúUncle Tim‚Äù over and over again.

On Friday, Scott told Fox News;

Last night what was trending in social media was ‚ÄúUncle Tim,‚Äù and they doubled down on this concept of liberal oppression. It is stunning in 2021 that those who speak about ending discrimination want to end it by more discrimination.

The left has‚Ä¶ doubled down that they are going to, not attack my policies, but they‚Äôre literally attacking the color of my skin. You can‚Äôt step out of your lane, according to the liberal elite left.

Leftists on Twitter and Democrat-allied pundits on CNN and MSNBC were also reportedly angry with Scott‚Äôs contention during his rebuttal that he does not believe America is racist despite personally experiencing discrimination.

Yet there is very little data available that could help journalists and policymakers make sense of this apparent trend. To understand why, Quinta Jurecic spoke with Jeff Asher, a crime analyst and the co-founder of AH Datalytics, who recently wrote for Lawfare on why there‚Äôs so little reliable data on anti-Asian violence‚Äîor on any other kind of hate crime. Jeff discussed the patchwork system by which the FBI currently collects data on hate crimes, what other factors might explain why the data is so unreliable and how improved data could help guide the response to anti-Asian attacks.",0,lawfareblog

11400,"Get the facts straight on what happened on our broadcast the other day with Mike Lindell. Some folks are either misleading you or they‚Äôre just ignorant.

Mike said something that IF WE LET AIR could have potentially resulted in us being permanently banned from YouTube- or at the very least be banned for two weeks. Because of that, we had to mute a few of the words he was saying- but we later uploaded those full remarks to another platform.

IF we would have let those remarks air, the four MILLION people who watched our YouTube video yesterday may not have been able to watch President Trump speak at CPAC on our network.

Mike would not have wanted that- and YOU would not have wanted that.

Mike completely understands why we had to do it- and he is not upset about it. He will be back on our network soon to discuss it.

We have a history at RSBN of showing you what no one else will and letting you decide for yourself. That‚Äôs still our mission to this day.

However, without an ally in the White House, the rules of the game have changed. We must now do what we have to do in order to survive, protect what we‚Äôve built and continue to bring you programming.

The alternative is a world without RSBN.

Also, this was not ‚Äúcensorship‚Äù. You folks know better than to think we would ever do that. We couldn‚Äôt let it play on YouTube, but to prove we aren‚Äôt trying to prevent him from speaking his mind, we uploaded his full remarks (UNEDITED) to Rumble immediately after, a platform that allows true freedom of speech.

And a major driver behind many of these actions is a growing hostility toward members of racial and religious minorities among white Americans and a growing willingness to turn to violence as a result.

Last week, the Lawfare team was hosted by the National Security Law Society at the Georgetown University Law Center for a live discussion of what this disturbing trend means for U.S. national security. Benjamin Wittes, Jacob Schulz and Scott R. Anderson joined Elizabeth Neumann, a former senior official in the Department of Homeland Security during the Trump administration, and Ryan Greer, the national security director for the Anti-Defamation League, to discuss how white extremism and domestic terrorism relate to each other, what's driving radicalization among white Americans and steps the Biden administration, among others, can take to combat it.",0,lawfareblog

Shop now: bit.ly/3dW3XBG

Even by the most unrestrained estimates, the Covid pandemic never approached the lethality of the Spanish flu of 1918. Yet the effect that our fears, amplified by the mass media, had on society were infinitely more debilitating.

In times such as these, our Christian faith has always offered hope and strength. But this past year was different. The reservoir of Christian belief was drained to dangerously low levels, and many Christians succumbed to the epidemic of fear.

In this clear-eyed book about the real Covid crisis, Philip Lawler dissects how Church leaders and the faithful responded to this health emergency.

It returns Myanmar to full military rule after nearly a decade of quasi-democracy that began in 2011. The coup came just hours before the start of a new session of Parliament, which was expected to endorse the results of a November election where de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party won in a landslide and the military-backed party performed poorly. The military has alleged voter fraud, but Myanmar's election commission has said that there is no evidence to support its claims. Since then, the country has seen daily peaceful protests and large-scale strikes against military rule, at times clashing with security forces who have been seen using tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds. To break it all down, Rohini Kurup spoke with Aye Min Thant, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist based in Myanmar.

Why the Church Must Spread Hope, Not Fear, in a Pandemic"" by Philip F. Lawler.

Shop now: bit.ly/3dW3XBG

Even by the most unrestrained estimates, the Covid pandemic never approached the lethality of the Spanish flu of 1918. Yet the effect that our fears, amplified by the mass media, had on society were infinitely more debilitating.

In times such as these, our Christian faith has always offered hope and strength. But this past year was different. The reservoir of Christian belief was drained to dangerously low levels, and many Christians succumbed to the epidemic of fear.
