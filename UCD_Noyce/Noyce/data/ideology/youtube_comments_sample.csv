The results never really got published anyway and it had serious impacts on the people involved. One of the famous triplets eventually committed suicide and it's worried that it was all linked to the separation causing depression.

195270,2080324,"I suppose you'll need to show me the evidence that people making good life choices are nevertheless being stymied because of their skin color or backgrounds. I'm not seeing that in my life here among a wide variety of people and income groups, nor are great researchers and economists like Thomas Sowell finding this to be true (read Discrimination and Disparities). Carolla is a prime example of someone with a really negative background taking the ""bull by the horns"" and changing his family story. Everyone I know is bending over backwards to help people willing to work hard no matter what their skin color, and as someone who volunteered with a highly successful youth theatre for many years, I saw so many opportunities for underprivileged children go untapped. Once, we held a camp in a rec center that had more staff members than campers. We brought in an adult staff of 3 and a teen intern staff of 12 ‚Ä¶ all for 8 campers. Meanwhile, middle and upper class families paid top dollar for sold out camps with 75 children per camp. I don‚Äôt believe that America is full of selfish, heartless people stepping on those less fortunate, and I think it‚Äôs up to our cultural leaders to shift the conversation and not allow people to wallow in some esoteric, often comforting vision of being kept down by their skin color or their circumstances   ‚ÄúBlame‚Äù is a negative term for what I prefer to call a healthy dose of shame. The left refuses to ""blame"" people for their choices, but at some point, you must say, ""It is shameful to have children when you cannot emotionally AND financially care for them."" Instead, people like Kimmel blame ""the federal government"" for not taking care of children, and he particularly points to Conservatives and Libertarians who do not believe that the federal government should raise children. You suggest that these values are universal, but I disagree. I see a nightly barrage of leftists refusing to put shame or blame in even the tiniest fraction of the lives of those making the mistakes. Whether they (like you) can agree to this personally and privately doesn't matter. They refuse to go on record in the public sphere and make what could be live-changing statements to people poised to make what could be super destructive choices.",1,The Daily Wire,Carmen McNew

I am again disheartened to know they were damaged by the action of Mr Clinton. Yet We are Millions of men and woman of all walks of life. I am a Vet who has served my country with pride. I would be honored to serve with Hillary Clinton as Commander and Chief. As far as the other Candidate running for office. No Experience. No Experience No Experience. That is the TRUTH.

At the time they weren't looking after me properly.  the original surgery failed, tissue had died and I became infected again.  
on some level  I knew I was fighting for my life. I told them I was dying.

I had to go through another 8 or 9 hour surgery, After which I got pneumonia .   It was emergency surgery and I don't think the theatre had been cleaned properly.  it was bacterial pneumonia so I'm guessing I got it from the  oxygen mask when I was put under.  it could have been anything.

I had a ventilator via the trachea and it was a nightmare.  my throat chakra is very active  and I felt like I was being chocked by it.  some days I can't tolerate a necklace sl this was complete hell.

I had a gay guy nurse and he was fighting with me because it was so irritating I wanted it off.  he kept slapping my hands and telling me to stop because I would die.  He would have to tell on me.  I remember thinking if it wasn't so uncomfortable and tragic it would be quite funny.

I don't think you realise how traumatic ICU is until you get out and start getting better.
 I had a flash back the other day.  my husband was pulling my sheet and it took me back to being tossed around the bed on the slide sheets.  an instant of horror till I realised it was a flashback.  almost 18 months ago now.

The British government had realized as early as the 1640‚Äôs how beneficial white slave labor was to the profiting colonial plantations.¬†¬†Slavery was instituted as early as 1627 in the British West Indies.¬†¬†The Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series of 1701 records 25000 slaves in Barbados in which 21700 were white slaves.¬†thousands of whites endured the hardships of tobacco farming and lived and died in bondage in the New World.¬†Following the cultivation in 1613 of an acceptable tobacco crop in Virginia, the need for labor accelerated.¬† Slavery was viewed as the cheapest and most expedient way of providing the necessary work force.¬† Due to harsh working conditions, beatings, starvation, and disease, survival rates for slaves rarely exceeded two years.¬† Thus, the high level of demand was sustained by a continuous flow of white slaves from England, Ireland, and Scotland from 1618 to 1775, who were imported to serve America‚Äôs colonial masters.¬†England essentially dumped its unwanted in the American colonies, where they were treated no better than livestock.¬† Servants were regularly battered, whipped, and humiliated. ¬†Disease was rampant, food was in short supply, and working and living conditions were grim.¬† War with local native Indian tribes was common.¬† Severe punishment made escape unrealistic.¬†shipping of more than 300,000 white Britons to the colonies.¬†""In time, the English thought of a better way to use these women to increase their market share: The settlers began to breed Irish women and girls (many as young as 12) with African men to produce slaves with a distinct complexion. These new ‚Äúmulatto‚Äù slaves brought a higher price than Irish white livestock and, likewise, enabled the settlers to save money rather than purchase new African slaves.

Trump funded his entire campaign by donations from civilian supporters and his own pocket. Bernie was praised by people for funding his campaign though civilian donations but Trump was doing the exact same thing and nobody batted a eye. Americans donated 5 million dollars in 24 hours after it was announced that the Democrats where seeking impeachment inquires against Trump. Most of Hillary's donators where big banks including many of which where broke years before and got bailed out by the federal government along with Google which was found to have manipulated search algorithms to put Democrat web pages at the top of search results during both the 2016 election and state elections in California and it is said that several million votes where turned towards Hillary and Democrats running in California. That is proof of intentional manipulation by a global corporation in politics.

At least there won't be ""screaming at the sky"" on the election day anniversaries. I'm thankful for that.

1651517,54422,"@2010nagual I'll never know if my son would have supported the migrants, if he would have fallen for this globalist agenda.  He was all for helping people, but he wasn't a fool. This question haunts me and i can only speculate on the answer because he was killed 7 yrs ago, shot in a tragic and unjustifed homicide.   That incident was why i had first gotten on the internet,  to see photos of him that friends shared and to read their condolences.    After the first year, i began seeing what was happening in the world.  He was a caring person, but i think he would have seen through and opposed this insanity. One morning a few months after his death, I met a young woman who had gotten a tattoo in large block letters ""to honor Roland's memory""  is what she told me.     The word tattooed in large lettering across her midriff was ""THULE"".  He had been her neighbor and had ""saved her life"". ""twice""  is what she told me. They werent close friends but sometimes she would sit on his porch and talk for a while.  She said he had spoken of this word as meaning the place farthest north on ancient maps, or it could refer to ""knowledge which is just beyond that which we know now,  knowledge that we have not reached yet"".  It was a little bit humorous because she wasnt a slender person and it looked quite strange on her slightly ample midriff, but what a tribute it was for me to see that day when i had been so very sad.    I had been crying just before i'd met this girl while i was walking on that July morning.  It was so odd and so sincere i couldnt help but laugh and feel joyful that id met her.    She was a connection to Roland, almost seemed as if dhe had been sent to comfort my broken heart. I have to smile when i think about it.   I want to think that he wouldnt fall for this insanity that liberals have forced on everyone.  But i dont know, he was a kind and caring man and saw the good in people.  So, i wonder.  I wish i could ask him about his conversations about the word ""Thule"" and about how he would see all of this thats being forced on the people of Europe.",1,One America News Network,Patricia Salvatore

Trump's LACK of ""NICENESS"", forever on display, was shown when he disgustingly and shamelesly attacked McCain, saying he was "" not a war hero because he had been captured.  I like people who weren't captured.""  Trump then not ONLY INSULTED McCain, and pointed out what a DRAFT-DODGING HYPOCRITE, HATEFUL BISH and LIAR he is, but he also succeeded in OFFENDING any objective and ethical Veteran and service member, ESPECIALLY those where were P.O.W.s at one time. True patriotic Americans also took note of that NOT ""NICE"" Trump display, that sadly, we now TRAGICALLY EXPECT from him.  Fox News even took note of Trump's rudeness, bishi-ness, hatefulness and vindictiveness,  calling out Trump for not speaking kindly about Sen Mccain's end-of-days. Trump even went so far as to extend North Korea's Kim Hung Un the 'WARMEST REGARDS"", but fell intentional silence about McCain.  Trump barely caved, and spoke of his concern going out to McCain's family, but refused to speak about McCain in any NICE or DECENT way. We now know Trump both BLOCKED the White House's prepared KIND words about McCain, and tried to keep the US Flag from being lowered half-way in his honor too.  We KNOW that Trump MOCKED McCain's challenged walk, in the same DIGUSTING, SHMAEFUL and SHTT,  LOW-LIFE way Trashy Trump made fun of a dislabled reporter and imitated Hillary Clinton's temprorary disability from pneumonia.  Trump is SO NOT ""NICE"", that that didn't bother him a bit, when's he has no conscience nor filter, , and thought making fun of the sick and disabled is somehow statesmanlike, Christ-like,  and gentlemanly,  DESPITE he having a newphew who's disabled, and his own father, equally HATEFUl, BULLYING and BIGOTED, Gred Trump a KKK supporter, who suffered and DIED from pneumonia. ...

Let's see the excuses that you trump supporters say about these things...

Trump's secret Chinese bank account?
Or trump paying $180k+ in taxes to China?
Or trump paying $100k+ in taxes to India?
Or trump paying $100k+ in taxes to the Philippines?
Or trump paying $15k+ in taxes to Panama?
And how much has trump paid in taxes to his own country over the last 15 yrs or so?
No wonder trump doesn't want anyone to see his taxes...

Or how about trump and family making all their products in china?
or when Ivanka trump received all those Chinese trademarks while trump was fighting his trade wars and our American farmers were going bankrupt?
Or when ivanka was stealing designs from other designers and having the products made in china and india paying next to nothing in wages?

And you all claim that it's Biden that's in bed with China?

Trump claims to be a law & order president but refuses to pay for that law & order in the 14 cities that he agreed to pay for the extra police & security needed for his rallies. Trump owes almost $2 million dollars to those 14 cities & is now telling those cities to sue him if they want their money. So trump apparently does not really support the police or he would have paid them like he agreed to....guess who is going to get stuck covering all that overtime pay? The cities will have to make up those lost dollars, it's the people of those cities that will eventually have to make up the difference if the city doesn't have it. Just shows you just how much trump really cares about the people in this country.

BTW, save your childish lefty insults for others because I'm a conservative and yes, I am going to vote for Biden along with many other republicans and also with the republicans that have worked with trump who know exactly what trump is doing and has been doing to our country!

Democracy has already been stripped away when dismantling a open honest election in the name of Covid-19.  The reason our civilian population could be fighting on the streets is because DEMOCRACY IS GONE IN AMERICA and CO-19 was weaponzied to ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT THE EXCUSE TO TAKE IT.  Democracy is having a election that verifies the identity of voters by in person ID verification and additional feedback for absentee votes.  Republican and Democrats should be fighting together to get our Democracy back rather than citizens fighting on the streets and lawyers fighting in court on who becomes President! Our Nation is coming into violence because Democracy has been stripped away, so we should protest for Democracy and a open honest election that verifies the identity of person like we do in everyday life. Petition/Protest for another traditional re-election by the end of this year, any other route will finish Democracy and cause us to destroy ourselves!! So please start a petition for this. THIS ELECTION IS FAKE  In the case of the mainstream media narriatve we should not require ID in person to obtain alcohol, cigarettes, title work, notary, get drivers license,  ammo, passport, buy/pick up a gun or background checks for that matter, permission to board a plane, if we don't need ID in person for a president election! You can not have a real election unless you can verify the identity of someone in person and date of ballot cast. This election is fake just like the media and people believing their statements. How did we get this stupid where we let the media tell us what is true without questioning it???? How did we let them control the narriatve of our lives?
 Ways you can cheat. If you have more votes than registered voters like Wisconsin. I also can see dead people getting ballots and voting.  Ballots getting post marked stamped before the election date but after the election as they are taking days to find votes for Biden.

Veritas deals with whistleblowers all the time and they know a lot about WB protections etc. and he even said that Veritas said to talk to them before talking to anyone, which he likely did before this and knew to record it. As far as two party consent, if the IG was recording, that means IG is already consenting to be recorded. Not just by them either. But by Alex too. I think this was all done in the manner it was to expose witness tampering. Expose the corruption at a higher level. Okeefe would have advised him to get an attorney if it wasn‚Äôt all set up. 

You know when testimony is muddled when the interrogator is doing more talking than the witness themselves.  Alex was giving his original comments in the original affidavit per recalling what he had heard. Within the first like 30 mins the guy made him nit pick what he remembered by making him feel like he had to recall specific words/quotes that he heard and only the specific words/quotes he heard should be included in his statement. Kind of like trying to recall a convo you overheard where someone said ‚Äúhe went into the garage and then he hid the weapon in one of his toolboxes‚Äù - his recollection would just be that he overheard that he hid the weapon in one of his tool boxes, but the only specific words he remembered hearing was ‚Äúgarage, weapon, toolbox‚Äù - if a person was trying to discredit this witness they‚Äôd say ‚Äúwell you don‚Äôt recall the specific words ‚Äúin between‚Äù so you‚Äôre just using your logic to ‚Äúfill in the blanks‚Äù - which is not true.

If you'll notice I haven't really attacked Dr. Ford, I've been concentrating my efforts on the Democrats and their unethical actions.  The Democrats don't care about Justice, they only want Power. 
I'll believe Dr. Ford's allegations *IF* there were any actual evidence of it, you point me towards any case with provable accusations and evidence *I'LL* probably want to do worse to the accused the you do.  But since there is no evidence then Kavanaugh MUST be held as innocent, we can't destroy a man on an accusation alone.

Firstly, at what point? Secondly, even if they did (and you're completely forgetting that the Catholic Church functionally is not the only Church, but let's play along), _did what they do violate the Christian ethos exhibited by Jesus, the Apostles, and all venerated saints?_

*Get new material.*  

Most historians flat out disagree with your assessment that Hitler was a Christian worth his salt-- the evidence they can find demonstrates such. 

""And still so not that antitheist that he was above using the church as a weapon against his enemies.""

I already talked about how the religious persecution of the Church was already a reality from the 20s until *some point* in Stalin's regime.

The chances of entering the US by trespassing without being arrested by the CBP are nearly zero. The illegals are crossing the border on other, less obvious ways and a wall won't hinder them from doing that either. 
The real purpose of the wall is sending a message to the Mexicans AND the US citizens. (And Trump needs to build it so he can say ""I did something to stop illegal immigrants, unlike the democrats"")
The thing is, there is no clear line between legal and illegal crossing. You can techincally cross legally as long as you have distant relatives in the US, you know a place in the US where you can work, you seek asylum or you're a refugee. That's not very specific or strict, right? But I'm sure it would be much stricter as soon as there is that wall dividing the two countries.
