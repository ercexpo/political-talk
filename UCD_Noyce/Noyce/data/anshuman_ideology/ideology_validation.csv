Oil is a finite resource, and the Norwegians have shaped a fairer society expected to outlive their oil reserves."

0,"All your comments have done is reinforce my beliefs about modern conservatives. You are willing to spite yourself and the states that form your core base as long as you can drag poor people down as well. This is a hateful and bitter ideology. I make decent money so your proposal would personally benefit me and I would still never support disenfranchizing millions of people, because dragging fellow Americans down for my own political gain is a cruel and evil thing to do."
1,If the news says they are being equal on their reporting. Why do all the liberal press say exactly the same words every report they do?
2,Yes and he will never get his way and a fraud and needs to be kicked out of the White House for treason and jailed for treason against our country
1,"This is explosive!
My thoughts at this point are: the Democrats must have known that the response from Trump would have been a lawsuit and investigation like this, given that their (democrats) fraud efforts were so blatant.  They must have realised that all of this would become public knowledge at some point - so how do they expect to counter this? What's their next move here?"
1,"So, suggesting Biden might want to investigate police violence because police should not be abusing citizens in the course of their duties is not good enough? Are Republicans not scared enough of Biden, so you have to put a little ooga-booga on it and bring up Obama?"

2,Trump never filed personal bankruptcy. From the little reading I did on his Bankruptcies they seemed like a master stroke. Especially the casino one. He eliminated big debt and dumped shares of a casino onto his debtors in exchange for the debt. A property he wanted out of anyway.
0,"Because you've made a strawman argument. Your opponent is arguing against ""paying for other people's healthcare,"" despite having no clue whatsoever regarding what risk pooling is or what insurance does. Insurance of any kind, for any reason. Including the kind you can buy off the blackjack dealer.

The proper ""paying for other people's healthcare ..."" response is, ""Yes, we'll continue doing that because that's literally what insurance is and what insurance does."""

1,"As much as I think that Trump was a great president, I don’t want him to run in 2024. I’m tired of defending his stupid remarks. 

I’d much prefer Ron DeSantis to run. Ron is like Trump but he speaks better and has less stupid blunders. I don’t think Trump can win either, his reputation has been tarnished. 

Assuming that the 2020 election was fair, Trump lost for two reasons: 

Trump kinda abandoned the populist rhetoric that got him elected in 2016, his entire campaign strategy in 2020 was just calling Biden a socialist.

The second reason was that his blunders almost overshadowed his campaign, I really didn’t like some of his rhetoric but I still supported him.

If Trump wants to win in 2020 he really needs to bring back his 2016 campaign style and be more careful with his bad phrasing."

1,"Half of the world might've been mocking Trump's bombastic personality and unconventional style, but they were still taking him very seriously, particularly our adversaries (China, Iran, North Korea, unorganized Islamic terror groups like ISIS, and sometimes Russia).

I haven't seen anecdotal evidence of ANY country, even those who are our allies, of taking Biden seriously. And our adversaries and enemies, particularly China, do not take him seriously at all, as evidenced by the bold lecturing China gave US diplomats in Anchorage recently. 

Biden's gaffes, flubs, confusion, extended absences and ""senior"" moments aren't just noticed by the American public and media. Other world leader's are taking notice, and most assuredly planning on taking advantage.

Sure, Trump had his bloviating, outspoken, off-the-cuff and, sometimes, clownish moments, but adversarial nations still refrained from crossing him bc they knew he was very serious, very confrontational and oftentimes aggressive. This has yet to be seen in Joe."

Trump was a one term president and that's all he needed to be. 

He completely altered and helped correct the political fabric of the world. 

To reelect him is to say he couldn't get it done the first time around.

1,lol Bill never paid a dime himself Fox did lol. And those were defamation settlements basically because the accusers couldn't prove shit in court but if they went public with their bogus claims it would have had an impact on his show's ratings and pressured advertisers to withdraw their ad buys.

2,"I have had mixed feelings about Haley for several months. At one time I was a big supporter, and I would have said “Haley ‘24.” Her January 12th Politico interview changed my opinion of her. I thought she did an excellent job at the UN. When she left the UN job, it made no sense to me; and she didn’t give a satisfactory explanation for her departure. I think she doesn’t like Trump, but wants to use him to springboard her own future political ambitions."

It probably has something to do with E Jean Carroll, a woman who has been trying to get a sample of Trump's DNA for a long time in order to prove that he raped her. They've been fighting in court over his DNA for quite some time now. With Trump's lovely track record when it comes to women, I'm sure there are others."

1,If the election was won fair and square by Dems.....then why did they attempt to stop the AZ election audit by filing lawsuits and lost all of them in court and now have called on DOJ to stop the audit. It appears that the Dems are trying to hide something in AZ. Once the democrats win begins to unravel it may not look so “fair and square” anymore.

2,Doesnt necessarily mean evil intentions from all pollsters. Many Trumpvoters don't admit their preference to pollsters due to possible social ostracizing ('shy Trumpvoter effect').

The fact that you said the double standard has been changed is not apolitical. Indeed, it's **very** political. Again, look at who is getting raided and who gets softball interviews where they're not having to give statements under oath. There's no question it's political in nature."

1,"IMHO-- I think that the best thing that Trump can do right now is: To do every thing in his power to flip the Senate red and flip the House red by a large majority for 2022 elections. Then he can work on 2024. By doing this, his efforts to win the House and Senate will make him unstoppable for 2024."

No former president has ever tested the amendment's legal restrictions or meaning by running for the vice presidency. with the way things are going for Biden, Could Obama try and end run and challenge the amendment so that if Biden wins and then is put out to pasture Obama could then step in to run the country again.  I'd love your thoughts on this question."
2,We will never find a press secretary as good as her.
2,Yes. Leave it to the NMAAH to lecture me about whiteness. The piece was based on the ideas of a white woman. I can't think of a more disrespectful thing than to let AA people have their message and their memorials hijacked by woke white liberal woman. I bet she got her draft of bulletpoints in on time.

The fact is that many [people are using cigarettes to self-medicate]( which means that people in need will seek other forms of ""help"". In my opinion this is why we are seeing such an expansion of the obesity epidemic in poor neighborhoods as cigs get more expensive and junk foods get cheaper- while healthcare is out of reach.

2,"Depends, its all about degree. Left wing populism can be damaging in the USA as well. When Bernie lost the Iowa caucus, his supporters accused the system of being rigged just like Trump did when he lost. This may not seem like much, but when it happens enough, it causes decreases in social trust and political instability, all of which are bad for social democracy, which relies on a degree of social trust to maintain their welfare state long term."
1,"It’s a complex concept, but in the simplest terms before the Voting Rights Act of 1965 most southerners were Democrats.  After that the core values of the parties switched so the Democrats of the 1900s and 1860s who were owning slaves and enforcing Jim Crow became Republicans."

0,"They way things are going, anyone who still identifies as an independent is most likely a Democrat. The division between common sense and ethical decision making is a vast chasm that won’t be “compromised” and fixed between the right and the left.  It is now a one side vs the other. There is no negotiation or compromise to be accomplished. Marxism must be defeated."
2,Wow that is something else. How someone can be that incompetent and still be considered a leader is mind boggling.
