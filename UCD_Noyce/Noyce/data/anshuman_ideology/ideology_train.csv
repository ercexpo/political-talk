Schooled I don't see any reason why they can't be open if we have school choice then parents can decide what school they will go to or if they will be homeschooled but now they can get online K through 12, you can also get a college degree by studying and being educated through your computer connected to a college and get your degree you don't have to sit in a classroom to learn anymore it's nice to have the, interaction of classmate and a teacher or instructor to answer questions to put things in perspective. I could see students doing most of their studies online and once or twice a week actually face-to-face with an instructor teacher that can go through their material with them do any explanations that I needed help them with any corrections that are needed it's a simple thing nobody has to make this such a big deal. All we have to do is vote America first and there's only one way to go for that and it's Donald Trump the man who wrote The Art of the deal nobody can do better than him he's the master of the deal and that's what our country needs a strong force but never got down that has a good view of the future and what it could be like one way or the other and I'm all for the one way Donald Trump.

Mr. Kyle‚Äôs ‚ÄúPunching Jesse Ventura Story‚Äù was contradicted by the Coronado Police, while his ‚ÄúTexas Car Jacking Story‚Äù was contradicted by both the Johnson County Sheriff and the Johnson County District Attorney.

Considering the trove of fabricated stories told by Chris Kyle that have been discredited by both military and law enforcement personnel, it is highly likely that many of the stories contained in Mr. Kyle‚Äôs book also have been fabricated, either partially or totally."

1,Not really it just takes more auditing to ensure tax dollars are being spent on birth control and abortions are at cost.
1,"When you legislate against family planning services like Planned Parenthood (only 1 location in some states), you inherently reduce access to birth control options. I‚Äôm not sure how else to put that. 

When you legislate that sex ed is to be taught on an abstinence-only curriculum, you inherently reduce knowledge of how pregnancy happens, how it works, etc. I‚Äôm not sure how else to put that. 

I do believe that maybe I mis-communicated in my first comment, because I obviously didn‚Äôt make it clear enough that when it comes to the ultimate goal of reducing unwanted pregnancies, and therefore abortions, modern Republican legislatures are a horrific atrocity, and the data proves that out."

1,"Yes education is key. I don't know where you get that Republicans only want to provide birth control and ignore sex education? I may be misunderstanding your point. Education is key but also teaching accountability. It also goes back to home structure and being taught early on that when you decide to engage in adult activities there are adult consequences and you have to be responsible. 

No republican I've ever discussed views on abortion with has the mindset of wanting to control women's bodies. Republican views on abortion come from differing views on when life begins and see abortion as termination of a life that was given a choice or chance."

And before I'm called an idiot for calling it a civil war, it's not a physical war, but a verbal war. Every body is so opinionated over stupid bullshit,  and they decide now is a great time to be stupid and irrational because they want to look good. That's exactly what this moron is doing. He doesn't care that he abandoned thousands of Afghans in their homeland, he cares that people like you think he looks good. In my town, Biden was inaugurated, and within the first week the gas prices had gone up 1.50 a gallon. What a great president. A real leader who got us through covid. Oh I was mistaken, he didn't. He just caused more conflict, all he did was tell people what they wanted to hear and then act like he's a hero for it. I'm not saying Trump was good either, because he was a jackass.

Well that's some foolish thinking on their part because that's their base.  They aren't winning elections by landslides in most places.  There doesn't have to be some enormous sea change for them to lose enough elections to keep them in the minority.

Even the cable from diplomats were mid July, not like early June. Biden was put into situation with two choice leave or start a war. For the past week they only focused on bad stories, not a single interview from veteran who supports the Government move.

They want to keep the pandemic going because it creates fear and uncertainty which they will then use to blame Dems (as evidenced by the subject of this article).

*""Things are bad...Dems are in charge...it must be the Dems fault""*

Personally I believe that intentionally causing the deaths of thousands for political purposes is an act of treason and terrorism. It's insane to me how the media and especially Dems are just treating this like its political horse race stuff. Dems should be out there screaming from the rooftops about how Republicans like DeathSantis and Abbot are literally murdering thousands of Americans and that they are terrorists who should be fucking arrested and jailed for decades."

I believe that it wouldn't take much effort in such a position to make power structures like the military question who they should be taking orders from which has a lot of potential for chaos. You'd have neighboring states recognizing different federal governments as legitimate. The divisions would only widen from there. The capital attack was just a piece of the effort. By itself, it would simply been a bad look but the desires and efforts of certain members of elected government were going to use the chaos as cover to advance their own agenda which very well would have brought the government down.

OFFICIAL WHITE HOUSE STATEMENT

FBJ: COVID-19 VACCINATION CARD IS UNLAWFUL AND ILLEGAL

' the GOVERNMENT has officially stated that any and all covid-19 vaccination cards are
without question and un-deniably ILLEGAL AND UNLAWFUL EVERYWHERE

the issue of these cards does result in FBJ investigation and subsequent charges for those doing it.

no business nor drug center nor medical institution nor international commerce HAS ANY LEGAL AUTHORITY TO REGISTER these cards nor use them as an 'entrance"" checker
NOR AS TRACKERS AND SHALL BE PUNISHED.

NO paper governance nor law enforcement can issue these cards as ""official"" and
paper judges have no authority and jurisdiction in their enforcement use.

all PHARMACY RETAIL STORES such as Walgreen and CVS and Walmart that
are still administering illegal and unlawful covid-19 vaccine shots in ""SPEAKEASY"" setting
have been already judged. you all know that those guilty of doing that pass from the LAND OF THE LIVING TO DEATH.

they are being sold across the counter now because those doing the shots are passing away and nobody is left to do the vaccine shots and issue the cards and they are losing money big time on these covid-19 poisons.

any paper law enforcement actively engaged in the enforcement of covid-19 vaccination cards shall be prosecuted for unlawful and illegal racketeering

It's an excuse for hatred. The worst kind of hatred is hatred that the hater believes is in support of a higher cause. People will do unbelievably terrible things in that case."

A deranged psychotic man attacks and brutally murders a pregnant woman, the unborn child also dies as a result of her injuries.

0,"To pull troops in May arguably wouldn‚Äôt have received this outcome in such a rapid timeframe. In May 2021 the Taliban only controlled a fraction of what they control now. The wave of occupation would not have been as violent as we are seeing now, thus the reason Trump encouraged Biden to follow the May 2021 agreement between the a Taliban and Afghan Government, as opposed to his delayed date.

Bipartisan agreement was that a rapid and unorganized evacuation under pressure was a worse case, and would lead to mass violence ...here we are as an example of this.

For months the admin has been aware of the slow, then rapidly increasing, victories over province control in Afghanistan. Everyone from the press to the military and intelligence communities could see it approaching.

The issue of the military industrial complex is a topic that covers decades, I can agree with you on that. However, what we are seeing here, over the weekend and start of the week, is a complete failure of a campaign closure, and it falls on the Biden administration.

_‚ÄúThough the former President offered his support of President Joe Biden's plans to bring home American troops, he urged his successor to draw an end well before the September 11 deadline that Biden set last week. [...] We should keep as close to that schedule as possible.‚Äù_

He blatantly disregarded intelligence, armed the Taliban to the teeth so when we inevitably go in next it will be a slaughter, and made one of the worst military decisions possibly any president has made. 

We abandoned our allies, are openly being disrespected across the world, and made this world a lot more dangerous of a place because of his immaturity. 

Or are we going to talk about the blatant disrespect for every dead service member brought home according to a barrage of witnesses‚Äô and gold star families?  

This president is effectively the sole reason for tens of thousands of deaths and ensured many more to come in the future. 

Calling out this administration for the blatant disregard for human life is only right, if he faces jail time so be it, he did the right thing.

If we want more progressive candidates, we need to be participating in every. single. election. I've already voted in my state's primary and will be voting this November.

A February deal between the United States and the Taliban said foreign forces would leave Afghanistan by May 2021 in exchange for counterterrorism guarantees from the Taliban, which agreed to negotiate a permanent ceasefire and a power-sharing formula with the Afghan government.

AND THEN

--

A tweet last week by President Donald T-rump calling for U.S. troops to be home by Christmas has given the Taliban the upper hand in negotiations, the top Afghanistan peace official told the Financial Times newspaper.

I didn't realize how much rhetoric actually influenced people, even more than actual policy decisions did. I didn't realize how being charismatic means you literally hold hundreds of millions of people in the palm of your hand, and you can almost do whatever you want with them.

It's something I don't think enough people realize, or at least didn't at the time. Rhetoric matters. Attitude matters. As President, you aren't the same as Congress - you're not there to write legislation. You're there to be a leader to ""We the People."""

0,"The virus will mutate regardless of what happens in the US. The big variants have all come from abroad, which is exactly what probability tells us is most likely. The way to prevent variants isn't to shut down the US, it's to ramp up vaccine distribution and uptake worldwide. On the scale of things, a virus spreading in a half-vaccinated population of 330M is absolutely nothing compared to this thing ripping across the other 7 billion mostly unvaccinated people on earth.

Spreading out infections doesn't prevent mutations either unless significantly more people get vaccinated in the lag time (which is clearly not happening). Mutations happen as a function of the number of viruses produced. More viral replication = more mutations. Spreading it out doesn't do anything. 

As for hospitals in the south, what exactly do you propose we do? Should Maine and Massachusetts shut down because Arkansas hospitals are busy? Arkansas didn't actually shut down last year either. Unless you're going to perform a coup of their local government, establish an authoritative regime, and force the ignorant fucks to vaccinate and socially distance, things are just going to happen as they happen there.

To me, it feels like we've done basically everything that can be done, and all other options likely have exceedingly low return on investment."

I don't think this was inevitable, but I don't see how the US could've done much differently. At some point the US has to pull out and the Afghan government and military have to go it alone. Their leadership sucked though. I think they're figuring it out. 
  
As for Trump, the deal to pull out was a bad one, but it doesn't change much. Everyone knew this day would come and the Afghan leadership failed their people. But what can the US do? They can't choose their leadership for them. 
  
It does look like the Afghan Army is pulling it together and fighting back along with the better parts of the Afghan government. If they succeed, it'll be because of what they do. Not because of the US. Just like the last few weeks."

As one of the dominant currencies in global currency baskets, mismoves by Congress or the Federal Reserve can have catastrophic global consequences.    

About crypto?  Who owns it?  Who oversees it?  Nobody  We see Elon Musk quite reliably pumping Dogecoin with a few weeks at the end of his fiscal quarter, and then dumping it a week after the books close.  

Bitcoin is heavily used by terrorists around the world for ransomware.  The mythical value is the anonymity, yet governments are showing success at seizing wallets used for crime.    Speaking of criminal terrorists, North Korea is one of the leading countries that use crypto for criminal activity.

If you lose all value in your crypto, the way it has happened to many people - who do you deal with to get partial indemnification or a refund?

Nobody.  Nobody.  This is exactly the model that caused multiple financial collapses in the United States from 1830 through 1880.  Five complete financial collapse, bank runs and depressions that lasted for years. 

Because of these collapses, we created the Federal Reserve to oversee currency and debt.  The closest we've come to a collapse was 2008 because of speculative investments.  Sound familiar?  That cost us more than $1 trillion to bring under control.

We have the FDC which exists to oversee financial institutions to protect consumers in the event of a collapse.  No crypto is FDC backed, meaning - a collapse in any crypto leaves it's investors without recourse, and no government backing means they'll never see a cent of it again.

That's why we don't support crypto  It's the subprime mortgage of financial instruments."

* The US has left it's support staff in the outer cities - those who worked alongside US troops, translators, people who worked on their bases, their families - whom they have responsibility too, to the Taliban - and they will likely be killed. More can be evacuated from Kabul - but those in other cities are lost - This alone is a major disaster.
* [The US failed to coordinate with the ANA]( Leaving the ANA without the ability to maintain it's airforce and supply it's ground troops - vastly accelerating the military defeat - and it seemed like the American troops were running which destroyed what was left of the ANA moral.
* The chaos the disorganised retreat has caused makes this seem like the Taliban defeated the US more than the ANA. It has left a surprising amount of US military hardware in the hands of the Taliban.

This is already enough. [People who fought alongside the US have been betrayed]( and left for dead. When they should have been evacuated.

The ANA have been fighting for a decade - for the last five years they have done the vast majority of the fighting. They had decided, and the majority of people opposed the Taliban.

I was raised steeped in Western culture. Grandparents in the German film industry, photographer dad, actress mom. They taught me (some) German and French. Went to international school. Studied physics and medieval studies in a college with a Great Books program. 

I can't think of a better way to spend an afternoon than at the Met or MOMA. 

Am I ""proud"" of Beethoven and Mozart? I had nothing to do with them. I enjoy them, I love them, I am deeply moved by them. But pride implies personal achievement. Just look it up: 

1. feeling deep pleasure or satisfaction as a result of one's own achievements, qualities, or possessions or those of someone with whom one is closely associated.
""a proud grandma of three boys""
2. having or showing a high or excessively high opinion of oneself or one's importance.
""a proud, arrogant man""

I am quite proud of a short play I wrote that got a good review in the NY Times. It brought me to LA where I met my wife who was a TV writer. (Our little joke is that we met through the NY Times.)

I am proud of my father's work, with which I had little to do, but I helped him in the darkroom and changed his film sometimes. 

I work in the space program and I'm proud of that, though I'm in a support position and have nothing to do with designing or selecting missions.

But to be ""proud"" of Monet or Voltaire just seems bizarre to me. I love them and would defend them, and I'm deeply moved by them, and would be devastated if the works were destroyed. But pride doesn't enter into it."

1,"Believe me,I get your argument,I think that the current system does have a lot of problems but a European styled healthcare system would just make it worse. The reasons why we're paying the most on halthcare per capita is

‚Ä¢ we can,Our system allows us to pay whatever we want to and a lot of people set up their own healthcare insurance companies only to insure themselves at ridiculous prices to get tax deductions and this boats the cost for the average person

‚Ä¢ While the system is broken in terms of cost,it is clearly much better when it comes to quality. US does better than Canada,UK,France,etc when it comes to survival rates

‚Ä¢ US has the highest life expectancy IF we account for murder rates. 

‚Ä¢ US provides most of the medical research to the world. Countries with socialist Healthcare systems will have to invest billions if US companies weren't providing them medical technology and research work.


My point is,as someone who has seen both the systems,the US Healthcare system is not at all as bad as some people claim it is. It,sure, could get better. That would be possible if we lead deregulation in the medical field and increase the supply of doctors by reducing government restrictions. Also,the image that poor people are dying on streets because of the health care system is a lie,over 90% of people are covered by either private insurance or by Medicare and medicaid.

If you‚Äôre a Democratic activist and you haven‚Äôt figured out by now Americans are generally ignorant and apathetic and only respond to powerful emotions, there‚Äôs no hope for the party. Fear and hate are what our opponents use. You can‚Äôt ‚Äúlogic‚Äù someone out of these emotions, you need to compete on an emotional level. 

Does anyone genuinely think Americans will reward Democrats for better policy? Even if it has a positive impact on their lives? Please. Seriously, Democrats passed the largest family support program in US history, every family across the land will be getting hundreds to thousands of dollars in monthly direct deposits that will vastly improve their lives. This was barely a news story, a couple of Democrats talked about it for a few days. Where is the coordinated multi million dollar ad and PR campaign?

Learn the only valuable lesson from
George Bush and Donald Trump. Americans are venal and self interested. Batter the same message mercilessly, day after day, week after week, month after month. ONLY then does it ever get through the thick skulls of Americans. 

You CANNOT win against emotion, passion, fear, hate with logic and facts and - ‚Äúlook how great this policy is‚Äù - Americans just don‚Äôt give a shit. Republicans realized this long ago. They didn‚Äôt even bother with a policy platform in the last general. 

If you as a Democratic activist have not realized this yet, just give it up or you‚Äôre in for a lifetime of losing. And frankly it will be deserved. If you can‚Äôt craft a compelling emotional message for voters to beat literal traitors and seditionists, what is the point. 

Seriously, if Biden doesn‚Äôt drop this fools errand of ‚Äúbipartisanship‚Äù (that ship sailed long before Jan 6) he will lose the respect of a massive swath of the Progressive base.  People DO NOT care if you‚Äôre ‚Äúnice‚Äù, ‚Äúcooperative‚Äù etc, they give lip service to that idea but all Americans care about is ‚Äúwinning‚Äù and ‚Äústrength‚Äù. Biden won‚Äôt even stand up to Sinema or Manchin, how can he stand up to our enemies? - it‚Äôs a ridiculous comment but sadly true.

Additionally, the state has bad data on race and vaccination. Some counties and municipalities are collecting it, but even then the reporting I've seen is poor, like not providing raw numbers, nor adjusting for proportionality (for example, reporting that 15% of those vaccinated this week were AA, but not indicating which percentage of that was of the vaccinated, unvaccinated, and total, populations. i.e. no denominators.)

Their DOH has already come out and made clear, they really don't know how large the information gap is but are working on it (as of this summer.) It has improved, but isn't perfect, and poorer BPOC are still having access problems but measurements are poor, there is limited research into the barriers for different groups, few targeted programs."

The War on Terror, also known as the Global War on Terrorism and U.S. War on Terror, is an ongoing international military campaign launched by the United States government following the September 11 attacks. The targets of the campaign are primarily Islamist groups located throughout the world, with the most prominent groups being Al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, the Taliban, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, and the various franchise groups of the former two organizations. The naming of the campaign uses a metaphor of war to refer to a variety of actions that do not constitute a specific war as traditionally defined.

And since ROTpublicans HAVE NO MORALS to speak of, they are not willing to just go home when they DON'T HAVE THE MAJORITY. No, they've got to then STEAL the votes, by screwing up the entire voting system... and KEEPING it screwed up in a ROTpublican direction.

The USA proved this was effective under both Trump and Biden.  Now we‚Äôre suffering again thanks to people spreading these lies.  Viruses mutate.  That‚Äôs why we get a different flu vaccine every year.  Covid mutated in the the more aggressive and dangerous Delta variant.  Now people with no defenses, folks who refuse to get vaccinated, are being hit hard.  This sucks and is completely avoidable.  How do I know this.  I‚Äôve got two doctors in my family, both working ICUs.  Both watching people suffer and die.  Direct observation of fact.  Please get vaccinated and end this.

Edit:  As I noted in a follow up comment below, I was looking at the unvaccinated occurrence of infection, not the overall country rate.  But this also bought up the key difference in vaccination between Sweden and Israel.  Sweden is far more vaccinated than Israel is.  Hence lower  Hence relaxation of mask and social distancing.

Now, Republicans are doing the exact same thing the Democrats were doing because now instead of ""orange man bad"" it's ""old man bad"". The majority of people agree leaving Afghanistan is a good thing, and if notching a military operation was grounds for impeachment we wouldn't have had a president serve their full 4 terms since JFK botched the Bay of Pigs.

The ONLY thing impeachment will do is exacerbate the same problems we're having right now because Kamala the snake will be president and she's 50x worse than Biden. Don't be like the Democrats.

When Taliban comes through your village, they walk into your house and demand food and shelter. If you don't provide, you die. When my friend was there in his village, he did laborious farm work to blend in, so they could tell that Taliban guy ""oh ya it's just my cousin staying with us and helping us for a while."" After 4 days there, Taliban guys rolled through and my friend had to hide in the fields until they left. Then the Taliban blew up the power plant so there was no power there anymore. No one knows why, they are just ruthless and careless terrorists with 0 respect for human life.

What do you do with people who have such a sophisticated network and just kill anyone and everyone who looks at them funny and aren't afraid to die, at all? When 1 person in your village speaks out, your entire village.. Your friends and family.. are ALL at risk... It's horrible psychological warfare and terrorism."

> People are tired of the working conditions and expectations that have developed, and have finally discovered their worth as employees, 

Financially you are only worth what someone else is willing to pay you. You don‚Äôt get to determine your own financial worth. Otherwise, I‚Äôd determine my financial worth to be $10 Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have any skills that are worth $10 therefore no one values my financial worth at $10  

> People want to be able to survive and be happy without having to kill themselves working 70 hours a week. 

Then get a new job. If working 70 hrs a week is not paying for your needs, you either need to reduce your expenses or get a higher paying job. A few years ago I was making I didn‚Äôt like making that little money. I decided I wanted to make more money. I went on google and looked up high paying jobs. I found one area  that was high paying that I was relatively interested in, and I googled what qualifications I needed to get one of those jobs. For this specific job, it was a specific college degree. Now it doesn‚Äôt have to be a college degree, for some high paying jobs it could be trade school, a software coding boot camp, a certification program, etc. But for this specific job, it was a specific college degree. I then decided to go to school to get this degree. It sucked, and between school and my job I was putting in 70-90 depending on the week. I had no life whatsoever for 4 years, and like I said, it sucked. But it was totally worth it. I now work in the industry that I had originally researched. 

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the pay for your current job, you need to get a higher paying job. In order to get a higher paying job, you need to acquire a skillset that people will be willing to pay you money for. Like I said above, this doesn‚Äôt have to be school, as school can be expensive. However, there are plenty of affordable ways to attend school, and I am perfectly happy to share these with you (or anyone else) if you care, and I would love to help. Regardless, trade schools and certification programs can also be great ways to increase your skillset. 

> Even people working 40 expect to make a reasonable wage and be valued as employees.

Again, if you (or anyone else) wants more information on how to do this, please let me know, or visit It‚Äôs really not difficult at all, and I‚Äôd love to help where I can.

I caught whatever UNNAMED *flu here in Sacramento. I was not out of the area, and my symptoms were textbook down the list, and to get back to normal took a year plus and I am still not 100%. I am now vaxxed for everything and am short on empathy for unvaxxed adults. Begging for a vaccine when one is near dying... me, I love vaccines, and that I was vaxxed for everything else is likely what saved me. I am up to date on everything. Side effect of covid is pneumonia. I am vaxxed for that, too. My case may have been semi-mild, believe me when I say folks do not want this beast. I lost about 100 lbs. Still cannot eat right. I don't smoke, quit 30+ years ago. I was lucky, my cousin died on a ventilator. Oh, and I am now type 2 diabetic because high fever fries the pancreas. This is another side effect of covid 19. 

It scares hell out of me because little kids cannot be vaccinated. People need to get the shots.

I am anticipating the day I get my BOOSTER.

BTW, this was in the USOFA  before they announce the ""pneumonia thing"" in China. That was Dec 31, 2019. I was not out of Sacramento County for any of the previous two years.

0,"I agree, there are a lot of reasons why Bolsonaro got there in the first place. I even voted for Bolsonaro in 2018, but because I was disillusioned with the polarized reality of that time and thought he represented a drastic change and action, but as it turns out he was another right-wing populist nutjob, and I slowly began realizing it just like many americans did with Trump. You rightfully point out the Supreme Court is politically appointed, but guess who appointed a judge who freed Lula from jail? You rightfully point out corruption is rampant, but guess who is the one who destroyed the Car-Wash Operation? Yes, Bolsonaro, because turns out, he is a corrupt crook along with his entire family. In the beginning, I used to believe that ""Bolsonaro is a fascist who wants to be dictator"" was just leftist conspiracy, but the more he began actually voicing against democratic institutions, the more I realized all these speeches about ""cleaning the swamp"", or about ""saving the nation"", or about ""the corrupts within congress"" have always been far-right dogwhistles and I had fallen this conspiracy rabbithole, which I have slowly been escaping ever since the pandemic began.

So no, there's no such a thing as ""communist-inclined"" opposition against Bolsonaro, because a lot of prominent right-wing political movements such as the MBL broke off with Bolsonaro, so his opposition is pretty broad even though there are indeed left-wing people in the opposition, just like every opposition against a far-right government. No, there is no such a thing as ""Bolsonaro is for electronic plus paper ballot"", because even if he was for that, the true intention of his when voicing for this agenda is to make people distrust the system and de-stabilize democracy so he can come out as ""the man who will solve it all"", and this entire agenda of electronic plus paper ballot is another dogwhistle for ""the democratic system is bad and I want to be dictator"". Yes, there is no transparency throught society and yes Brazil is a banana republic, but the ""twist"" is that Bolsonaro himself is part of the infamous ""Centr√£o"" of brazilian politics, you know, the ""banana politicians"" themselves, of the rich and powerful?

To summarize: the only thing Bolsonaro ever did for Brazil is to pave the path for the gangsters of Lula to come back and continue their legacy of corruption in the name of the poor, he destroyed the legacy of the sane right-wing who only wanted to fight the corruption of Lula and the PT, and most importantly: the deaths of thousands who fell into his far-right rethoric that the ""virus doesn't exist"", or ""if it exists, China made it up"", just like what happened to many americans with Trump. So fuck Bolsonaro, fuck his far-right nutjobs and fuck his terroristic ""milicias""."

You're technically correct: Trump didn't directly tell people to inject themselves with disinfectant. 

Trump suggested ‚Äî publicly, while addressing the people ‚Äî that *scientists research the idea of* injecting disinfectant into Covid patients. (Psaki didn't say Lysol, she said ""poison."") The problem with this is:

* It was a stupid, unscientific suggestion. Too stupid and unscientific for scientists to waste time ""researching."" It's already well-known that injecting people with disinfectant will poison them.
* It was an irresponsible suggestion to make in a public forum. It very predictably resulted in a stark increase in people trying to poison themselves by drinking bleach.

There's nothing hypocritical about taking medical advice from Trump instead of from scientists.

But all this is moot, because have nothing to do with vaccine hesitancy and everyone, even the reporter who asked the question, knows that. As the article states:

""Doocy‚Äôs suggestion that people who refuse the vaccine are doing so because they listened to Biden instead of Trump ‚Äì and then stopped listening to Biden immediately after his September 2020 comments ‚Äì does not square with reality. 

A Public Religion Research Youth Core poll found that **Republicans were more likely than independents and Democrats to report vaccine hesitancy** and white Evangelical Protestants were the religious group most likely to report vaccine hesitancy, both groups that are unlikely to make major decisions based on comments from a Democratic politician."""

To them, ""democracy"" doesn't work and they'd rather focus on things they care about, such as their careers, families, and fame. If our democracy is going to survive we have to make sure that people understand that if you don't vote, you don't get to complain when things don't go your way.

Just because there was not a death does not mean they did not take fire or sustain injury.

I personally have two disabled friends from that war. I helped him move his stuff into a storage unit before he deployed. He father had to come help me move it out for him when he came home. 

Who fucking cares what anyone thinks about this. It's not about looking a way. It's about getting our Americans back home from a hopeless war they should have never been involved with. 

At the end of the day. Americans have died, become disabled, and have mental illness in the name of Afghanistan. A country that would never return the aid if needed and would never consider us an ally.

0,"Every political fight they have is an ""us versus them"" battle of wits and words.

And everything that isn't specifically in lockstep **with** them is **against** them.

So along comes a disease. And their opponents (who value objective reality and science) say it's real, and how to mitigate the threat. Then, using science and reality, vaccines are perfected. But they can't stop thinking in ""us versus them"" terms, and so the old reflex kicks in. Whatever science says, they say the opposite. It's not a virus. Masks are being pushed for a reason that isn't basic hygiene. Vaccines are a front to track people. Reality only has one way, but to say things that counter reality? The possible conspiracies are infinite.

They started a battle of wits against something that literally doesn't have a brain, they think they're pretty smart but they're trying to outsmart a virus, and as a result they're losing every battle. So all they have to do is adapt, right? Get vaccinated en masse, admit they weren't right before but they're on the side of reality now. But that's the thing. They can't.

Their great strength is now one HUGE fucking weakness, but their strategy has worked so well for them in the past and has given them so much power that they can't stop using it. They can't stop going back to the failed strategy because they honestly think it's going to turn around. Any day now.

It's like seeing a baseball pitcher who came up through school with an almost unhittable pitch, went through college throwing the same ball, goes through the minors as a superstar ...but then he gets to the Major Leagues. And the Majors wipes the floor with his ""unbeatable"" throw, but it's all he has. He can't stop throwing it, because if he's not throwing that then he's not throwing at all and he's out for good. The moment he started getting hit for a ridiculous ERA in the Majors, he was already done. He was already finished and washed out, he just couldn't admit the reality of his situation yet. So he keeps throwing it because maybe it'll turn around. Maybe next throw. Or the next one after that. Or the one after that.

That's where we are right now. Denial, confirmation bias turned up to eleven, unwillingness to admit that everything they were told was a lie and everything their hated opposition said from Day One was right all along. That would break them, make their whole world fall apart. 

I'd say the closest analogy to the whole thing, their politics, is an abusive relationship. They repeat the lies they've been told, they go back to the abusers that have put them in this position. And the outcome for them is the same as any other abusive relationship at this level: you either get out as soon as you can, or you're carried out in a pine box. Some people never get out of the abusive position they're in, not alive. That's where they are."

I'd bet that in Southern states, there is a mix of rightful distrust of the medical system combined with inability to get time off or ability to travel far to get to a vaccination site when they can get time off.  

I live in a blue state that has a fairly robust public transport system and had a ton of sites and resources and outreach to all communities.  I stay getting email updates.  

I also have a car, my employer pays time off for vaccinations (up to 2 hours per shot and 2 days for side effects), I don't have anyone else I have to care for and there were a LOT of vaccination sites. I'm not sure this was the case in Texas but a lot of states run by Republicans seemed not to push vaccinations or make them easier to access or to have outreach or to push employers to give time off for vaccinations. 

And even by the raw numbers alone I don't think he could be right.  

If 15% of your state is AA and 90% of them are unvaccinated they probably don't account for the largest group of unvaccinated if the entire state has a low vaccination rate."

0,"‚ÄúPundits spent years and untold pixels arguing about whether ‚Äúeconomic anxiety‚Äù actually motivated many Trump voters, an idea that seems shakier as time goes on and conservatism delves deeper into its anti-vax, anti-CRT politics. What‚Äôs more obviously true is that a large share of today‚Äôs Republicans live in parts of the country, including deindustrialized rural areas, that are simply remote from the sort of institutions, from government to colleges to major corporations, that tend to generate wealth and growth. The political tragedy of America‚Äôs shrinking communities is how that alienation has helped lead them to embrace a reactionary populism dedicated to waging culture wars and leveraging our outdated electoral structure to make sure a minority of the population can continue to govern rather than, say, taking steps that might actually revitalize small towns and farming communitie. The sort of robust immigration and public investment favored by progressives might help bring a place back to life, after all; owning the libs for the next decade or so will not.

When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer."" Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun wrote in Roe V. Wade. 

Life is complicated. Even before you try to add in some concept of a soul. There's a reason gestation is approximately 9months, just like there's a reason elephants gestation for 22 months. To try to arbitrarily say that it is a life at conception, or 6 weeks, or 15 weeks, or 24 weeks, misses the point. In Roe, The Court resolved this¬†balancing test¬†by tying state regulation of abortion to the three¬†trimesters of pregnancy: during the first trimester, governments could not prohibit abortions at all; during the second trimester, governments could require reasonable health regulations; during the third trimester, abortions could be prohibited entirely so long as the laws contained exceptions for cases when they were necessary to save the life or health of the mother. 

When do I think life begins? It's an unnecessarily unrelated question. Regardless of whether you believe that a zygote, or embryo, or fetus, has a soul, it doesn't matter if that soul cannot survive if removed from the mother before viability."

Why indeed.

As to why she this way, who knows. Maybe its because we never baptized the little one, maybe its because we are physically distant, maybe its because they all have post-graduate degrees and all I got is a diploma, maybe its because we are a liberal household.

>I do think you are displaying clear biases that you should examine. You claim you would hold this stance regarding either gender but that is just as disingenuous as people who ‚Äúdon‚Äôt see color‚Äù.

I'm torn on this, and don't know how to approach it. On the one hand I agree, because even while typing out ""if it was a female Mayor accused"" or whatever I thought to myself ""and when does _that_ ever happen?"" Not devaluing male victims of sexual harassment, it's just that women are far more likely to be targeted.

On the other hand, I don't agree. I don't think that having a neutral position on a topic means you lean more to one side. But then again, that just leads back into upholding the status quo which will solve nothing. Maybe I just don't know enough about the topic go have an informed opinion lol.

>You are automatically assigning more authority and ‚Äútruth‚Äù to the words of the accused over the words of the accuser instead of even attempting to present the idea of weighing their words evenly.

I do believe that, no matter how poorly worded my comments may be. Each position needs to be heard, but neither necessarily has to be believed. I'm simply a wait and see kind of person, I don't think rapid response to a topic like this is always the best solution. But I also agree _something_ should be done.

You are now facing the strongest opponent to American freedom that America has ever known and the odds of survival seem long. ¬†How did we succeed in the past against tyranny, oppression and assault?¬†

Some might say that we sent our former family members into battle with the best technology and resources available and they would be partly right. ¬†But our true strength has always resided in our steadfast faith in God. ¬†Our belief that our cause was just and that it was by God‚Äôs hand that we would prevail. ¬†

Let us renew that trust and faith and accept the promise of help in dark times. ¬† Let us unleash the greatest power in creation and call upon our creator to help us in the shadow of what seems to be the death of our Republic. ¬†One nation under God and in God we trust is the cornerstone of this nation.¬†

And so on Wednesday, July 8th let all God loving members of the American family and across the globe unite in prayer that first begins by acknowledging that without Jesus Christ we can do nothing and with Jesus Christ all things are possible for His glory. That in our own words we ask for guidance and direction to do our part in restoring the founding principals of this nation. ¬†And if inclined to do so, share those prayers with others by posting on YouTube. ¬† (Please share this message)"

George W. did what the overwhelming number of citizens wanted. It wasn't until later that it became prudent to blame GWB for every battlefield error and the war lasting for over a month. People had unrealistic expectations for how long it would take, making deals while they strengthen their forces dragged it out longer then gave the country to the enemy.

The only way I know of to make the best of the situation is to use the Taliban's breaking of the agreement and the worldwide public opinion backlash against them as good reason to allow General Milley to finally finish them off for good. Then after it's just a security mission again make sure there is ample cultural exchange by making entertaining our troops the best gig around for the local musicians. Seriously.."

The real kicker is the less people work the more expensive basic goods would become. Since they need to encourage people to work who otherwise don't need too. The new cost of living would require an increase in social welfare provided creating a cycle until provider just gives up.

You know how they did it?  By having a solid majority where Democrat legislators from more conservative areas could defect on certain issues.  Republicans did NOTHING to help any of this happen, but Democrats still had the numbers because their majority is solid.

The first amendment is quite clear that **the government** can't restrict free speech, so the headline is quite misleading when what we really should be talking about here are tech companies and news outlets policing what content they put up.

...and that's where the discrepancy occurs.

If you believe that outlets should have the absolute right to determine what they put on the air for outfits like OAN or FOX News then it seems necessarily you kind of have to be ok with Google completely delisting you from their algorithms or Youtube refusing to host your content because they too are effectively ""networks"". If you don't like that google has delisted your site, start using another search engine! Let market forces determine the outcome... This sounds like it ""should"" be the republican position. Historically it's the argument they've used for Fox News anyways...

If, on the other hand, you believe that networks should NOT have the right to determine their own content then you SEEM to be arguing that at the very least the Fairness Doctrine must be brought back and given ""lots and lots of teeth"". Bringing back the fairness doctrine, historically, has always been the Democratic position.

The first amendment, fundamentally is a right to speak your mind, not a right to be provided a platform where millions will hear you speak. In practice it's even more restrictive than that in that it only applies to the government not being able to censor you. It affords no protection whatsoever against networks determining via their own methods who they will give space to. This means fundamentally if a group WANTED to prevent google from having the power to delist people or youtube to censor them they would need to craft specific law (which currently does NOT exist) to prevent it. By default, they should have it under the exact same amendment--Freedom of the Press."

0,"I‚Äôm devastated by the loss of family members( not my decision) to abject insanity. Also I know that these insurrections have just begun. It almost seems an inevitability that we have to show them that fascism WILL NOT BE ALLOWED in the US. Which means violence just as it did in the 1860s. It has begun to keep me up at night. I‚Äôm literally livid at the thought of taking up arms against Republicans, but please lay out alternatives for me. At some point the shoe has to drop and we must say a very affirmative no. They‚Äôve shown already that they aren‚Äôt worried about armed conflict so where does that leave us? It just feels unavoidable at this point and they are getting worse. I don‚Äôt even feel like it‚Äôs the divide that is getting stronger. We still want the same things; healthcare, equal and civil rights, et al. They want Trump as an emperor because he embodies the things they closely hate. Tell me how a nation reconciles those differences?"

0,"Honestly, even before Trump ran for president, incels, anti feminists, and white supremacists were flooding every comment section.  Once Trump came along, naturally they flocked to his banner.  It‚Äôs bizarre.  I don‚Äôt think they have a life beyond posting nasty things on every single web platform they can find and attending Trump rallies.   Social media has a tendency to amplify the worst of humanity but they don‚Äôt seem to ever go away."

0,"It‚Äôs not the only means but that is dependent on what China does. It has not liberalized in the decades we have had trade with them, that dream is silly and not reality. They just become richer authoritarians (the government and its supporters, that is.) This is not controversial or mere speculation, the uyghur genocide continues, the Tibetan plights continue, the threats over Taiwan grow more severe, the state media and lower level officials recently stated they would nuke Japan unceasingly if they interfered in a hypothetical defense of Taiwan.

It is not narrow, it is correct. Narrow is to assume that the only reason governments or people are illiberal or dictatorial is because we haven‚Äôt traded or bargained enough with them."

0,"Age should also be measured starting at conception, then. Birthdays are now Conception Days. All human rights apply at six weeks of age. Men who beat their wives or otherwise induce miscarriage will be persecuted for first degree manslaughter in addition to domestic violence charges. Half of all medical costs paid by the father begins at six weeks. They will need to be added to health care coverage plans as well. No need for birth certificates there will now be Conception Identification with only a number until other information is obtained. Can a person legally not have a name? If not- you must be named as soon as conception is confirmed. As a zygote is now *life* a new *possible life* will likely be recognized. As such, male masturbation will be closely monitored and prohibited as it does not occur without external stimulation. Sex without procreative intent will be discouraged and you can bet birth control will be next to go. Any age restricted right will be measured from conception, obviously. The definition of life will need revision. Basic science and the seven characteristics of life no longer apply. So many nonliving things just became living. I‚Äôm not sure about this one but if the pregnancy or childbirth kills the mother doesn‚Äôt that make the person responsible the fetus? How would that work? Anyways- point is this whole idea is a stupid front for punishing and controlling women. You can bet that the rich will be getting abortions for their wives and the other poor women they knock up. Look- if I get raped and pregnant I‚Äôm gonna get put in prison for the abortion anyway so might as well shoot the rapist in the face just sayin."

If any charity were left over, I might spend it on people who didn't get vaccinated because of sheer cussedness and self-righteousness and then got seriously ill. But I might not have any left over.

And, this happens on the left too. It is going to get worse on both sides, because the republicans are planning on even more gerrymandering, so democrats are going to do the same thing in (preemptive) retaliation.

Another problem is that committee meetings are now open to the public by law (except for meeting with security implications). It used to be that lawmakers could hash out differences behind closed doors, and make decisions that were good for the country. Now, they have to do what their lobbyists want, or risk losing donations. The lobbyists forced this change in the 70s, because they sensed the legislatures were screwing with them, taking their contributions but not doing exactly what they wanted. Hell, most legislation these days is WRITTEN by lobbyists.

Another problem (there are more) is the loss of earmarks in the 90s. Earmarks were what is commonly called 'pork'. This allowed legislators to 'buy' support from a senator or representative when required by adding in some little bit of goodies for that senator or reps state or district. This seems wasteful, but it allowed compromise on bills one wouldn't think were subject compromise."

And recycling is great‚Ä¶ recycling just aluminum reduces the cost of making new things out of the same aluminum by a huge amount.

The Taliban taking total control of the media is an important story but you dismissed it and silenced Ana voice by wagging your finger at her and then holding your hand up to silence her in a very dictatorial fashion. 
This came off terribly. I'm not saying this as some sort of fan of Ana, I actually think she too often doesn't do her due diligence before reporting on a story and it clearly shows but as a boss I would never raise my voice to literally drown out the voice of a female staff member while wagging my finger at her and then use the ""stop!"" hand gesture to silence them.

200 plus days of hard lockdown plus a similar amount under heavy restrictions such as not being allowed to have any visitors, work, travel more than 5kms,( 3 miles), and curfew from 9pm to 5am.
We are under the control of an insane dictator obsessed with eradication of the virus while nuking everything!
Kids and people are topping themselves or attempting to, and going around the bend.
Fine for going to the protest or disobeying rules is $5000 dollars!!

We have Federalism for a reason. A lot of pro lifers voted against Trump in states like GA. I think the national dems are overestimating how unpopular state level restrictions are.

Until 2020, 100% of the Dem delegation to the House from Georgia was pro life dems.

I ask this seriously - if we claim to support democracy and a state votes to restrict abortion - arent we anti democratic for trying to overturn that at the federal level?

This aint Civil Rights - everyone involved can vote.

Make it a state issue but at some point we do have a Federal system.

Roe allows for state level restrictions and this case was not allowed to go forward because no one who was wronged sued.

I think we are approaching the same issue from different stances. But I do not accept the argument that Biden squeaked it through.

The disparity between the popular vote and the actual outcome is a measure of the level of democracy in the process. JFK won with less than 130,000 of the popular vote. No one questions him. Gore actually won the vote count in Florida, but Bush became president. It was close in 1876. It was close in 1880. It was close in 2020. What has *changed,* is that the popular vote hasn't meant much since 2000.

Biden is president because he *overwhelmingly* won. Democrats don't win, these days, unless it's overwhelming. We have to fight for democracy, because it will disappear if we let it go any farther. But Biden overwhelmingly won. By the popular vote. By the votes within the states he won. This is fact. You can tally up the votes in almost any election.

I was just saying that, in response to the comment ‚Äúgun free zones entered the chat‚Äù, schools are already considered gun free zones‚Ä¶ and by this logic, calling them gun free zones and making it illegal to have guns there should stop gun violence in schools, but school shootings are a huge problem in the US. 

So continuing with this example, a school shooter is willing to shoot and kill people‚Ä¶ so is writing another law that says ‚Äúgun violence is going to be the one thing that makes a potential shooter put their gun down and say ‚Äúyou know what‚Ä¶ this is illegal. I can‚Äôt do this‚Äù? 

I honestly don‚Äôt think so because it hasn‚Äôt yet. like another commenter said‚Ä¶ better enforcement could actually help. More access to mental health treatments. Less stigma on people asking for mental health help. People learning how to spot the signs that someone needs mental healthcare, and being able to provide it to even the poorest of people in our country might though‚Ä¶ and even then all of that might not stop it, but it would help. And again, without taking away the ability to own guns all together, bad people are going to break laws because they‚Äôre bad. (See the staggering US jail population‚Ä¶ things being illegal didn‚Äôt stop them from breaking those laws)

I agree fully‚Ä¶ If we didn‚Äôt have ANY access to guns(like UK) the amount of gun violence would definitely go down. That‚Äôs an absolute fact. That‚Äôs unfortunately just not a reality in the US."

You don't want to be either. I know it feels good because these are people you don't know and wouldn't have liked anyway. So what if the stupid assholes die? They deserve it, right? Sure. They deserve it. But it's still not good. Death is terrible. That is an entire human being blinking out. All their loves and fears and hopes and nightmares just ending. It's so sudden that you barely notice it happening unless you're watching a monitor. But it happens and it leaves huge scars on everyone associated with it. 

These people have children. They might be ignorant douchebags, but their kids love them. And when those children grow up they're going to remember that when they were burying their parents and grandparents, people like you were out there laughing about it. You don't want a kid growing up feeling that toward you. How many kids do you think there are like that? Tens of thousands? Do you really want to perpetuate that cycle for another generation? It's gone on long enough already. That's how we ended up here, in fact. Millions of people growing up knowing that the rest of the country... the rest of the world hates them so much that they laughed at their parent's death.

Don't do that. I get that gallows humor is a natural response to real life horror. Trust me when I tell you that I get it. But right now isn't a good time for that. I know why you want to do it. I have too, actually. But it's wrong."

Do you even know why we have devaluation in the dollar?  Do you know how fiat currency actually works and the global coordination of currency markets?  

We had moderate to mild inflation for several decades until Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1970, which crashed the economy throughout the 70s.  Yet, we still managed to have no carry over debt for programs - even Vietnam.  But in the 70s, we started borrowing money like crazy from Japan, to the point where  a minister of education suggested we cede Hawaii to them in exchange for writing off the debt. 

Carter used monetarism to increase inflation significantly which lowered the value of the dollar to repay the Japanese their dollar indexed funds.  This decrease the amount we owed them by billions of dollars.  Yes, stagflation: double digit interest rates, double digit inflation and double digit unemployment.  Short term pain (like 8 years) for long term gain of not carrying foreign debt. 

But Congress couldn't control its spending, and decided to leverage the funds in social security instead.  Throughout the 80s and 90s that's where we borrowed from thus increasing the total debt.  Various members of Congress then opined mightily about the impending crash of Social Security and that it should be privatized, like Chile did.  Except, Chile's program crashed and burned. 

We've been borrowing money for 40 years.   Mysterious, uncontrolled digital currency won't change anything other than create yet another ponzi scheme where the people who get in first, profit and the people who get in late lose money.   With no transparency and no accountability - that's what crypto is: it's a Ponzi scheme."

1,"The idea behind it is that the antibodies don't live in your body forever, so the fewer you have, the less protected you are. Catching COVID gives an number of antibodies, so you have an unknown level of protection for an unknown period of time. The booster shots are supposed to compensate for that. Similarly, we have to get a flu shot every year, sometimes targeting the same strain, sometimes targeting different ones depending on what's prevalent that year.

For the record, I'm all for do whatever you or anyone wants to do with their bodies (edit: so long as you're also, for example, taking appropriate precautions with the understanding of the public health risks associated), I'm just giving you the reasoning behind it. It makes sense that they would pursue a booster now that we're coming up on sick-season again. But you do you!"

Elder opened my eyes on the matter. Made me contemplate some important questions and consider things I had not considered. 

Would Rachel dolezal get reparations? Would Oprah Winfrey? Obama? Kamala Harris? When today there are FAR more poverty stricken white people in America than any other people. Do all black people get reparations even though many NEVER had relatives who were enslaved? What about those black people whose families were actually slave OWNERS? There were many. Who pays these reparations? All white people? All citizens whether they had anything to do with the slave trade or not? Republican families who sacrificed their own flesh and blood to liberate the slaves and end the infamous traffic? People whose families never even lived in the country until maybe 100 years after the infamous traffic of slavery had ended? They owe, too? The South was home to 250,000 free blacks. Do their descendants get reparations, too? There were ~4000 black slave owners owning more than 20,000 slaves. How does that figure into ‚ÄúReparations‚Äù?¬†Since the country‚Äôs founding 306,000 slaves were brought here, but since slavery ended more than 2,000,000 black Africans have come here by choice... another 1,000,000 Black Americans came here by choice and by way of the Caribbean. how does THAT figure into reparations?

Because of Larry elder it now seems to me that the only proper way to handle the inequities of the past is to make sure that our laws are just TODAY. That they‚Äôre applied equally to every citizen. To continue to provide access to opportunity WITHOUT favoring or handicapping ANY racial group.¬†I think that‚Äôs the best we‚Äôve got."

Yes, there are absolutely insane, clickbaity titles from both sides. However ..... the insanity is much deeper rooted into the more mainstream right-wing media than it is the left. You have your polar opposite counter part outliers, such as Infowars (right) and HuffPost. They both have a very small audience, and a small voice, despite the crazy partisan shit they release. Then you have your biased, but truthful sources. Msnbc, CNN. Both truthful, but for sure biased. Opposite them I would say are the Washington Times, or even the Washington Examiner. Still mostly fact based, if still definitely biased. 



Then there's Fox. Fox news is still the most (or maybe at least top three) watched cable news network in the country. ""Biased"" is not the right term, they fabricate easily disproven facts nightly. Tucker and Hannity lead the way, leading their audience into a different reality than even they themselves live in. 

There is no left-wing equivalent to Fox. Msnbc gets called the equivalent, but they aren't. Biased? Yup. Do I watch some of their shows? Yup. But it's still based in reality. My point being, both sides have fringe views. Crazy exists everywhere. But the crazy views and disconnect from reality is *much* deeper entrenched in right wing media. Those roots have a much broader impact, and a much larger megaphone to preach from."

     Also, I have been an amputee for 48 years now (since I was 3) and yea, little kids are sometimes scared, but mostly they are curious. If I can talk to them (always with parents permission) they stop being scared right away.

    The kid was German and was trying to tell her dad, ""Daddy, someone for got their leg. You need to find them and give it back before they fall over.""
    Dad was thinking, ""Oh god, my kid has found someone's prosthetic leg and is playing with it. What should I say if the owner sees this?""
    Well his nightmare had come true. The owner had seen it, but thought it was hella funny.
    Though the child spoke only German, and I spoke only English the father, once he realized I was not upset was happy to translate.
     I was able to tell the child about my leg through her father. The kid was extremely sweet. After I explained about my leg and got her to put it back, she said something and patted my head (I was in the pool at this point) that caused her dad to laugh. She had said, ""You poor man. Not only is your leg gone, you can't even talk.""

The same group that is very ""pro-life"" has also moved to ban access to women's medical procedures AND fund literal bounties and creating avenues to report mother's who have obtained abortions in states which have banned it. Mother's who obtain abortions can be punished with literal death. There's entire cities dedicated to being ""sanctuaries"" for the unborn, mean while they refuse to mask or get vaccinated and spread a deadly virus that is ripping the nation apart, all in the name of politics and their god.

The people left behind is a separate issue, but remember that the withdrawal itself is over; and it was a success and will likely become more POSITIVE as time goes on. THAT'S WHY Republicans are so fake mad right now, Democrats successfully withdrew the entire military with no deaths! Think about that. 

Biden is a very old president willing to take one for the team and be the guy that actually withdraws from Afghanistan. Nobody else wanted to try because they wanted to be re-elected and I doubt Biden wants to be the prez at age 86. 

Conservatives have been starving for red meat since Jan 20th and are already free basing dreams of '22 and' 24 BECAUSE they NEED something to change. So now FOX has to somehow turn a positive into a negative by using really good messaging and images of people at the airport or falling from the planes. FOX is using very obvious tactics but in a pounding wave approach that we don't usually see. Notice how NONE of the FOX clips about the Afghan exit has comments enabled on yt? That's partially the GOPs way of saying to their audience ""everybody zip-it! Let us show you what the approach and messaging will be.""


The people left behind is a separate issue that Biden will not be immune from but it begs the question ""who in their right mind is living in Afghanistan months after usa declares exit?!"" If you helped Americans in the battle for Tora Bora you should have been extracted to America literally a decade ago and if you're a contractor you should absolutely NOT wait until the last min you should have been gone months ago and if you're living there as a resident in the 2nd most dangerous shthole country in the world I don't know what to tell you

People that are fake mad right now won't remember why 1.5 yrs from now. By late 2022, the floating fact about ""the Afghan exit"" will be the minimal casualties and that FOX News said they were mad at democrats and that Trump would have done it better blah blah blah. I'm not pretending the whole situation is rainbows and butterflies but we exited with no deaths and history will be kind to Biden for that, you'll see.

>
I wasn't going to jump into this but I feel like it needs to be said. It's not even a fetus at 4 weeks of development, which is what this law bans, an embryo reaches the fetal stage around nine weeks of development. An embryo becomes a fetus when it has all the major body organs, though they are not fully developed and most aren't even able to work. At this point, the fetus cannot survive outside of the body. In fact, the fetus only has about a 50% chance of survival after the 22nd week of development, fetal viability, which is the bar set in Roe. After 4 weeks, when the ""heart beats"", it really is just a clump of cells with a rudimentary organ that can pump the mothers blood. If the clump of cells cant survive on its own, I don't see how it can be considered it's own life, it's basically a tumor at this point. Removing it should be as non-political and uncontroversial as getting your hair cut or tooth pulled."

Also, if one is spreading misinformation, don't you believe is is better to just oust them with facts rather than go out and BAN them. I've seen many times someone banned for ""misinformation"" and ""hatespeech"" and when I read it myself it's a complete lie and unfair. In fact I consider them irrefutable at certain times. If one is so wrong surely it wouldn't be hard, certainly if you acknowledge it as wrong, you know the reasons yourself and can specify them for the public.

Especially with twitter who ban posts on covid they label as having a potentisl risk of spresding misinformation. By doing this they pretty much acknowledge people are incredibly credulous and naive. Otherwise why else would they ban it? Surely the individual could judge for themselves whether it is misinformation or not.

Besides. How do we reslly believe a corporation like twitter has our best interests?(As a citizen of America) They are openly are leftist and actively censor snd silence opposing views. Trunp is banned while we have terrorists like the Taliban alloud on there.

In my opinion they just censor opposing views because they know there is the fear of convincing them they(the poster) are right. In which they don't want that for propably some self centered reason or they want to maintain along with all other sources a monopoly on news with leftist indoctrination(Trans, LGTBTQ+, Feminist movement?, and whatever else.

And where the only alternative was, what, turn Afghanistan into a semi-permanent U.S. colony? 

I get people being angry about the state of the withdrawal and the situation it leaves Afghan allies in (though let's be honest, humanitarian issues were always a secondary or tertiary concern compared to however an administration defines security objectives), but I'm kind of surprised that the anger hasn't been directed at the people who it appears incompetently ran and oversaw a two-decade-long war where it seems that not fighting or at the very least not fighting it like *that* might've been the better solution.

Once because the House was trying to protect Biden (an impeachment on grounds the Founders explicitly rejected, and on grounds the House didn't want to bother going through the normal process to resolve disputes), and once based on a false accusation with no evidence.

> Incited a riot against the capitol which ended in casualties.

False, according to the FBI, and the only casualty other than drug overdoses or unrelated health issues was an unarmed woman shot by a Capitol Police officer.

> Tried to overthrow an election.

False - though an interesting accusation given the Democrats' efforts to do exactly that for the entirety of the preceding 4 years, and particularly interesting given the massive fraud in 2020.

> Had his own DAG set up a special prosecutor against him and plunged the country into a massive corruption investigation he then tried to block.

False, according to Congressional testimony under oath by the people who originally made the accusation (who leaked classified information to the press in order to start it).

> Pardoned his friends and associates on his way out the door violating every possible ethical standard.

Following the Precedent set by Clinton.  That said, Flynn was framed by the FBI and the only reason a pardon was necessary was the presiding judge refused to drop the case as the DOJ had requested, in violation of a SCOTUS ruling.

> Revolving door administration with no end of resignations or firings.

Cleaned out a lot of the swampers.  Too bad the fraud kept him from getting another 4 years to do more of it.

> Told lies after lies after lies to the country and still does to this day. 

That depends a lot on who is counting the ""lies"".  A lot of what was counted as ""lies"" later turned out to be true.  Conversely, a lot of the ""truths"" told about him by Congress and the press later turned out to be false.

> Absolutely failed to manage Covid and treated it like a joke.



Also, the reason Biden has a vaccine to distribute is because of Trump's initiative.

> Constant legislative failures.

Trump was the Executive.  Legislative failures are on the legislature.  Still need to get rid of Romney and other RINOs.

> So inherently decisive and hateful he managed to...

...get 11 million more votes than he did in his first election - the most of any incumbent President, ever.

First off, the data sets are incorrectly identified, making the graph‚Äôs message, rubbish no matter, but it‚Äôs also a completely invalid way to present data over time.  NY and NJ were the initial epicenters for the pandemic in the USA.  They got hit early, hit hard and hurt badly.  4 major international airports in a small area of space coupled with major shipping ports made them very vulnerable.  The federal pandemic response office had been shut down.  That‚Äôs not a Democrat or Republican thing.  That‚Äôs simple fact.  They shut down first to save lives.  That was the right move.  Louisiana is basically Republican even though they have a Democratic governor.  The state assembly has blocked most protective measures.   On the flip side, MA is basically democratic.  They were part of the New England area decision which basically isolated itself and placed strict mandates in place on movement and businesses to get this mess under control.  Their rates spiked in the early days of the pandemic to horrifying levels, remember, in early days we didn‚Äôt have any viable treatments, and have since dropped and stabilized at some of the lowest rates in the country.  This while the southeastern states, under Republican leadership, continue to avoid basic controls that would save lives.  Hate to say it, but Republican governors, including the one in the state I‚Äôm from, are playing ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô politics with disease and it‚Äôs sick.

Everything essential for living could be provided to an individual but work would still absolutely be required. In fact it would no longer be optional at all. when services are provided for free what incentive is there to do it? I don't know how many people would work in a warehouse for free and the same goes for teachers, doctors, surgeons. These are absolutely essential positions that now need to be assigned rather than staffed voluntarily. You can't just not pay these people.

You can advocate for a higher wages thats fine, but removing or severely reducing salary *(Which would absolutely be necessary in a gov. controlled scenario)* has dire consequences. This is why the USSR had so many problems. Magnitogorsk is a prime example. So many people died in that industrial hell hole due to the sever lack of any real experience since they just assigned random people to work in the mines & foundries. I mean imagine being told to work as an ER tech with no option to leave or find another job else where.

In any scenario where a large group of people are permitted to contribute nothing to society. There is other which must suffer greatly to provide it. If you can't see that your either an idiot or don't want to acknowledge it.

Other legislators and the public in attendance were not informed of his condition until 6 days after he spread Covid throughout the room for over 7 hours.

The corrupt WIS Supreme Court, purchased by the Koch brothers, agreed with republicans, that the intentional deaths of residents should be allowed to continue. Obviously suffering from the ultimate demise may be the only way republicans possibly get the message that there is a deadly pandemic.

1,"I want to push back in the idea that the Dems are outright hemorrhaging minorities.  I think it's important to qualify what's going on here with minorities starting to vote republican. 

Let's look at the 2020 election. The Trump campaign made significant investments in reaching specific minority communities eg. Tejanos in TX, American Indians in NC, and black men in general.

With the first two, the Trump campaign used messaging that spoke specifically  to those groups. Acknowledging their history, and issues specific to them. In contrast the Dems reached out to those groups as members of the ""BIPOC"" Community. The idea of BIPOC people as a group was created by the left and is defined by their ""shared oppression"". This allowed Trump to win groups which republicans never won.

Trump was able to blunt the Dem edge with black men both through his personal appeal and superior messaging. Saying, if I'm president the economy will be so good you can get rich. But again the Dems just lumped them under the BIPOC label and told them if you like trump you're not black.

In conclusion Trump was able to either blunt the Dem edge or win outright with specific minority groups by tailoring messaging for those groups and giving them an optimistic as opposed to a pessimistic message.  The takeaway is that Trump's approach is replicable and useful, but requires significant investments in crafting proper messaging and finding the right groups to target."

He should've left troops there till the pact was finished, the borders and terms completely settled and a defensive national plan thought. Then is when he should have fled the rest of the troops home. If then the Taliban had attacked and the afghani army had also fallen, it's just hopeless."

This is literally what happened.

It's people being exploited by social media and the power of the internet. When you have con artists who can easily globalize their bullshit, you get widespread hysteria. Noticeably, a lot of the people (both statistically and in my anecdotal case) are extremely religious and literally worship authority - but only when it's ""their"" authority. So they get their identity completely subsumed by the ""movement"" or ""health practitioners"" they follow, and cannot get themselves out of it. But the ""wrong authority"" is treated just like other religions: ""false prophets,"" ""demonic influences,"" ""worldly people"" and such, who want to ""control"" or ""kill"" the masses or whatever.

0,"Issue is those shrinking states still get 2 Senators.

30% of the population will have 60 Senators or so by 2040.

All that means is they know they just need to get the Courts (done) and get their massive tax cuts in that can't be reversed easily (done) and they can just sit on the Senate to keep anything from changing. They'll point at the debt as a reason why nothing can be done.

From their point of view, they need to keep abortion as issue 1 for those 30%.

They are doing their optimal strategy.

It pushes the dems into a unwinnable dilemma.

Because they need to win less and less, they can be more focused on a smaller group and its easier to keep a smaller group happier.

Dems now have to win over more and more, and its *really* hard to get a lot of different interest groups to go along together. All it takes is one of the core constituencies to be ""less excited"" that year and wham, turnout goes down and GOP wins.

Their goal is to cause a disillusionment so they can keep their 60 Senators and their foot on the neck of progress. They don't have to do anything - their goal is just ""no,"" so they don't need anything but the Senate. Dem voters get disillusioned because Dems can't do anything when they do get power, but GOP base stays rabid because they get what they want."

If people refuse to take a free vaccine in the middle of a deadly pandemic and chose to continue spreading the virus, then they absolutely need to die.    
   
Now I agree with you, it's sad, super sad, double-extra-super sad.   
We should definitely not celebrate those deaths, but we should keep in mind that the Good Lord above us works in mysterious ways and most absolutely definitely shouldn't try to talk any republicans into taking the vaccine.

0,"So as an analogy, nurses are also trained professionals in positions of power over their patients. If twelve trained professional nurses decided last year to randomly murder their patients just because the patients looked at them funny, then yeah I'd probably encourage every state to look over their nurse training methodology and figure something out. I'd also ask the FBI to review the cases to figure out what radicalized these nurses into thinking murder made any sense, or what commonalities there are among the cases. Nobody should be afraid of going to the hospital and being murdered by a nurse, because we want everyone to feel safe and able to get the help they need.

Similarly if there's a nurses organization defending those nurses who murdered patients, I'd want that organization investigated to figure out why, what authority they have, and whether it's healthy for them to have this authority. That organization should be the very first to ostracize nurses behaving poorly and to set standards to demonstrate professionalism and care.

The same would go for any positions of authority, especially publicly-funded ones: school teachers, religious leaders, lifeguards, firefighters, national parks staff, IRS agents. Anyone who has authority over other people also has higher standards of responsibility and care that they should be held to."

The reality is that this was circled on the calendar for a long time. And there would NEVER be a good time to withdraw. Like Biden said.

Clearly, the administration wasn't anticipating that the nation's leadership would fold. I mean, the President actually left the country, right? We spent many, many billions to train their military to handle something just like this, and they didn't. And I don't know what allies you're talking about. The Brits? They left seven years ago? NATO? They're not going back in.

And they were a democracy in pseudo-name only. As long as Islam is the state religion, and almost 100% of the population is Muslim, there will be death and oppression. Because that's what drives that religion."

0,"Also, a lot of this younger generation has grown woke, and sink themselves in computer games and all the social media (e.g. tiktok), don't want to be part of society. Their behaviour are very similar to that fraction of Afghani population that is stoned all the time and just watch the world pass them by, as long they have their drugs ( video games in this case) and minimal sustenance, they don't care."
0,"I also think this is simplified. There is a strong argument to make, and one I subscribe to, that the Soviet Union committed genocide in Afghanistan. 1 million+ Afghans died in the Soviet war there. The people of Afghanistan were desperate for a way to fight and evict the Soviets from their country. I am not naive to think our arming of the Afghan Mujahideen was solely out heartfelt sympathy for their plight and had nothing to do with geopolitical competition with a competing superpower. But also, those reasons are not mutually exclusive. We helped arm them out of sympathy and because it was beneficial to our geopolitical situation, I think. In short, I don‚Äôt necessarily think us giving the Afghan people the means to defend themselves and their country against a brutal, brutal invader was morally wrong or bad policy, at the time. The Afghans wanted our help; we wanted to help; the greater Islamic world wanted the USA to help. 

The Taliban did not directly birth from the Mujahideen, but as a result of them and in counter to them. After the Soviets left, Afghanistan devolved into civil war between said Mujahideen warlords. The Taliban and their supporters came into existence in the mid 90s as a result of the chaos and brutishness of the warlords that had come to be as viewed wholly un-Islamic by many Afghans, and had destroyed Afghanistan even more after the Soviets left. The Taliban came to impose a brutal order to the chaos that Afghanistan had become. 

So, I guess it‚Äôs a mixed bag. I don‚Äôt necessarily think we did a wrong thing by arming Afghans in the 80s, but arming different factions helped create the civil war that ensued. If we wanted to help that, maybe we should have supported the democratic Massoud more? But then we would be interjecting ourselves into internal Afghan politics, vs helping Afghans fight a foreign invader. 

So I guess the conundrum is: if the world (because the USA was not the only one backing Afghan rebels against the USSR. Pakistan, China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, amongst others, all heavily backed the rebels) did not support the Mujahideen in Afghanistan against the USSR, then maybe our hands could always be clean of the mess that is Afghanistan. But if we didn‚Äôt, do we just sit idly by while another superpower invades a powerless people and commits genocide?"

I don't at all find it fair some rando in Iowa has more of a say than some rando in California. However, under a popular vote that rando in Iowa gets zero federal representation due to the large populations of cities.

A couple states already do this, but I support a split EC, that kinda puts it in between a popular vote and the system we have now. So let's say Biden wins the state at 51% and Trump loses at 49. Biden doesn't get all of the electoral votes, instead, he gets 51% of the votes while Trump gets the 49. It encourages people in states that feel their votes don't count to get out and vote."

1,"I'm not so sure Biden has committed a high crime or misdemeanor. Bungling the evacuation from Afghanistan, while clearly poorly planned, doesn't strike me as a high crime. I worry that the bar is being lowered too far for impeachment. Based on the standard currently proposed, President Ford could have been impeached for the fall of Saigon. 

Beyond that, do you really think Harris will be an upgrade?"
0,"This is one of those statistics that is true, but I personally don't find it particularly useful. In the first place, you could give every single one of those votes to Trump, and he still wouldn't have won. It would have been an electoral tie, and the House would decide the presidency according to the Constitution.

Any parsing of the states that Biden flipped should result in Trump being president. Trump threaded the needle in 2016, but he had very few paths available to him in 2020. Trump required either Pennsylvania or Michigan (preferably both). So it's seems a little cynical to me that those vote margins aren't included in these types of tallies.

Biden owns every state he flipped, and I'd even include the fact that Nevada was not a given. In reality, he flipped Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, NE-2 in Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Georgia and Arizona were basically nice-to-haves. He would have won without them. Alternately, he would have won without Michigan AND Pennsylvania. He had several paths to victory. Is it scary that he won on about 300K vote margin? in these states? That is very scary. But one can't ignore Pennsylvania and Michigan - and their roughly 235k vote margins - just to make it sound like Trump came closer in terms of raw vote counts. Trump's win really *was* that close of a margin, and he couldn't repeat it in 2020."

1,"I was responding to a comment about statistics being xenophobic. I simply stated that was false and foolish and that statistics can be misleading.



Denmark is the fifth most safe country in the world, and while mainstream news admits there are issues in respect to this area,



The reality is that reporting lags behind. I don‚Äôt know the reason for this, but since under reporting is rampant, it makes sense that criminal convictions would follow suit.  Instead of blaming a minority, this article describes a traumatizing process as the major issue.



This article expands on how antiquated the laws are, specifically calling for changes to acquaintance rape, the most common type of rape.  

The statistics are misleading because people are using it push a false narrative which blames refugees coming from a particular locality. It fails to account for the realities of the law and the people living there.  In short, statistics are misleading, and some people in this community are pushing their own narrative instead of actually doing the legwork."

0,"A key aspect to a happy world is harmony. Harmony consists everybody. Harmony is influential. Happiness is influential. Those two things don't exist in the overall human race because of a lot of set backs. One key thing that divides the human race is the difference in ethics. Good ethics or morals are principles that contribute to Good conduct and good conduct is a positive influence that contribute to harmony. Good ethics should be universal around the earth just like a smile generally means happiness around earth.

Here's the thing. Besides all the crime and misery that contribute to this sick world that has it's negative influence, you also have loose morals (let's say loose conduct for better understanding) and loose conduct has it's negative influence. Example, parents that regularly curse around their kids might influence their kids even if they tell them not to do it. Homosexuality, is, loose, conduct. It has it's influence as you can clearly see around you in today's world. It, contributes, negatively, to, humanity. How?

Homosexuality challenges the importance of ethics, logic and reasoning. Three common things you need for wisdom and Three common things that are challenged in committing crimes like murder, domestic violence, rape etc.. When you challenge those things in regards to the ethics of sexuality, it attacks the meaning of ethics in general and attacks the human cognition like, 'if I could do this I could do even more' which could lead to recklessness. It also attacks the meaning on quality of life, like how a person experiences life. Influence effects your motivations and your mental and physical wellbeing, and it's contagious because it effects you and everyone else.

So how is homosexuality truly beneficial to those doing it and to humanity? The world is like a family household, if one thing is out of place, everything is. So we all have a part on contributing to earth and humanity, it's best to be in harmony not disarray. But this world won't be in harmony with loose conduct, that's one key reason why the world is the way it is today.

They'll lie and cheat if it happens to suite them at the time. You want all the D's to have a forgiving heart and welcome the prodigal Rs with open arms to [temporarily] give them a moral home. These ppl will crawl back to the same kind of malfeasance as soon as [the next] Trump reverberates in their heads with finely-tuned perfection hate, bigotry and exclusivity. It's their siren song they can't deny - most of them.

>they will stay R's out of fear of having no community. 

They are becoming more minority.  It is the Rs who will need to adapt to the world - not the other way around. Your desire to coddle the [former????] Rs is the heart of D weakness and must be rejected. This is wartime conditions. Secure democracy, THEN we can be forgiving of mistakes in judgment.

This constant seeking forgiveness and redemption by D's is the D's Achilles heal. And now is not the time with democracy on the line. It's not the time for pity. The [former] Rs need to grow up and take their verbal beating like a grown up. It is well-deserved. When your petulant child throws a fit, do you just ignore it and do nothing afterwards? No. You punish the bad behavior ( timeout? ) to deter future outbursts - to prepare for interacting in society. If child fails to it will detrimentally affect child's future.

Your father is pretty late to the game - I imagine he lived through Reagan trickle-down economic lies + Bush same economics plan ( tax cuts ) that had been shown to be ( tax break for ). Maybe that got past your dad? Financial collapse 2008 caused by loose regulations on banks [Credit default swap]( Rs want less government ( = less regulation to allow more corruption ). Any of that affect your dad's judgment? 

Garland ( AG ) needs to prosecute all these MFs and let that be the deterrent for future insurrection + denial. Now is time for a different kind of strength. The Rs are an immovable object and I say we go right through them.

Debate has a purpose and should be part of any healthy relationship. Nobody gets along 100% of the time; so discuss issues and disagree. It becomes an unhealthy process when one side decides to be dishonest. If that side won't accept the punishment when caught, the relationship is over.

>We have to give people the ability to grow. Have all the hate in the world towards people still worshipping Trump but, try to find some acceptance to those who took longer.

You can't make them grow; but part of the process is accepting responsibility [that you seem to suggest be ignored]. Also in the process is deterrence ( punishment ). They must be chastised to ensure they believe what they proclaim ( converted ). it's just lip service and lies. Any defensiveness implies sycophant."

The Pentagon had 14-months from the Trump agreement in February, 2020 until their deadline to be out of Afghanistan by May, 2021 and what we saw was all the military could manage even with two extra months provided by Biden. But Republicans want to blame Biden - not Trump, not the JCS and Pentagon, not the local commanders on the ground - just Biden alone for the failure. Seriously or just for talking points?

Do Republicans think the US should have destroyed a billion dollars-worth of military equipment and left the friendly Afghan forces with nothing to lose to the Taliban but also nothing to fight the Taliban with? They just want some vague magic plan and to hold Biden accountable for not having such a magic plan. That‚Äôs an impressive level of hubris.

With no Trump transition team in January, how many months did Biden have to prepare for the May 1st pull-out (during a global pandemic)? Easy to armchair quarterback and say that the Biden administration should have ‚Äúdone something‚Äù in the few months they had (something besides stalling for four additional months trying to pull Trump‚Äôs disaster together).

There was no way to withdraw from Afghanistan that did not result in the suffering of women and children in that region.  No matter how much tax payer dollars were spent we were unable to create a healthy and prosperous government of the Afghan people, for the Afghan people.

I like Biden, I want him to succeed, I think the withdrawal was a reasonable thing to do, pretty much everyone wants out. This is much better than how Trump would have responded. It's still far from good enough he hasn't explained how this  withdrawal has been so completely miscalculated and has been such a monumental screw up. I think it must be investigated, and at the very least he should have stayed to answer questions.

Any party looking to start at the presidential level and not build from the bottom up isn't a serious party.  Look to the progressive area and especially the Granger Movements if you want to see how a 3rd party can succeed.  Of course these parties eventually failed when they decided to run a presidential candidate, but they were wildly successful up to that point.  

You've probably recently heard of the Wilmington Race Riots?  That was one of these progressive fusion parties that got those folks elected.  Progressives worked with Republicans in the South and Democrats in the North to win elections and gain seats in Congress.  

Eventually they decided to run their own presidential candidate and were outmaneuvered by the Democrats, who nominated their preferred candidate out from under them.

I think the distinction is that we regard the pregnant woman and the unborn baby as individuals with inherent value simply because they are human. That idea has ramifications. We believe both of those individuals have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. So because the baby is a living individual, it has a right to life and should be provided that as much as we are able. Additionally, the destruction of a life, which we would say begins at conception, at the hands of another is murder, which is something we believe is wrong.

So I showed him texts from my Conservatives friend in my Tennessee:  Prayer requests for people deathly ill in the hospital with Covid, heartbreaking stores about his friends dying, their orphaned kids, and his most recent text saying that he realizes his friends who are definitely Vaccinated but catch Delta Variant get much less sick, don't end up in the hospital and don't die.

Second, add new states to the union. It will make our system more democratic, not less. 

Next, abolish the electoral college and elect presidents by a popular vote system.

Make voting easy, not hard. Require voter ID, but give options for voter ID. Possible automatic voter registration, Allow mail in voting, don't close drop boxes, all states have independent redistricting commissions. 

Increasing transparency by disclosing who donates to a politician. Eliminate dark money.

This narrative will crush the left-leaning agenda of the Democrats. This is how Hillary lost in spite of popular vote. 

There needs to be a serious narrative change into increasing the left margin rather than Attacking the moderates into flipping to the Republican side.

Biden is showing signs of Onset Dementia. This Panic Retreat from Afghanistan is not any sort of closure, and to use the even-numbered calendar timespan to somehow make sense of what he did, is something that somebody going Senile would do.

Ultimately it comes down to this. You either believe the unborn are not people, in which case you can do anything you want to it. Or you believe that the unborn are people, in which case you can do nothing to it.

0,"Well, truth be told, the Biden administration should have validated this ""plan"" that Trump and Pompeo concocted to make sure the intel behind it was solid.  I'll admit, THAT'S on Biden's team.  But one of the biggest players in the withdrawal, was the will of the people.  And I don't even blame Trump for saying what he did in the video because he's not just playing to his base when he brags about bringing soldiers home, he's playing to the 80% of Americans that wanted the same thing.  

This shit was going to be messy either way.  The Taliban was going to swoop in and take over if we left in 2013 or 2050, and there's very little that could've been done to rip that bandaid off less painfully.  That's why Obama kicked it to Trump (though he didn't promise a withdrawal since he was on his way out).  

And I really wish I could say what Trump would've done had he won in 2020, but I seriously have no idea.  Part of me thinks he would've avoiding making the hard decision and just said, ""the Generals won't let me!"" and let whoever becomes President in 2024 take it on.

1,"Yeah‚Ä¶ the scare tactics are irritating.  I‚Äôm sure the ‚Äòlogic‚Äô goes along the lines of ‚Äòwe have to scare them to move them‚Äô.  Unfortunately there‚Äôs a lot of precedence for that approach.  The other tough subject is climatology itself.  This is really pretty new as a subject.  Only been active since the late 1800s and with meaningful data exchange in, ball parking it, the last 50 or so.  The good news is using ice-core data we can look back at the atmosphere makeup for a very, very long time, so that‚Äôs been helpful.   Climate, being both a regional and global subject, needs massive quantities of data to effectively study and the mathematical models used to predict change are evolving constantly.  So what we thought was true 20 years ago (discounting scare tactics) has been adjusted based on more measurements, analysis and study.  That‚Äôs the process of learning.  

Sorry I hijacked your initial point which is hugely valuable about the virus and vaccination as linked to science.   The vaccines didn‚Äôt just appear.  They‚Äôre the result of many people studying how to rapidly develop vaccines for a very long time.  We‚Äôre getting the benefits of those learnings with relative to COVID 19 which is a great thing.   The Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 didn‚Äôt have that benefit and many mutations sprang up from the huge affected populace.  That‚Äôs why we have annual flu shots now, to combat the active variants during the current year.  It would be nice to avoid that outcome with COVID and‚Ä¶ oh yeah‚Ä¶ not have people die of a preventable illness.  Definitely that!

Edit:  And speaking of scare tactics‚Ä¶ I just watched a clip of Tucker Carlson promoting the use of fake COVID vaccination cards.  This is BS of the highest order and that kind of scare tactic will get people killed.  Further, there‚Äôs no accountability to the idiot making the statements.  At a basic level this is the same as faking any other government record, but in this case, people can become sick and possibly die because of false records being presented.  No OK.  Not at all.  How he and Fox can think this is OK is beyond me."

>WASHINGTON ‚Äì President Joe Biden is under mounting pressure as he weighs whether to fully withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan by May 1, a deadline negotiated by the Trump administration.

>It was Trump‚Äôs fondest hope ‚Äî or dangerous obsession ‚Äî in his final days in office to withdraw the last U.S. troops from Afghanistan, as the fulfillment of his ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù ideals. In November 2020, as Trump fought his flailing battle to void the results of a presidential election, he signed an executive order mandating that U.S. troops leave Afghanistan by Jan. 15, 2021.

>In his 2020 book The Room Where It Happened, John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser in 2018 and 2019, depicts Trump as determined to deal with the Taliban. He recalls Trump trying to bring Taliban leaders to Camp David for negotiations in September 2019, eventually dropping that plan, and then reviving its outline in what became the Feb. 29, 2020 agreement.

>""This deal is entirely Trump's,"" Bolton wrote of that agreement. ""Time will tell who is right, and the full effects of the deal may not become apparent until after Trump leaves office. But there should be no mistaking this reality: Trump will be responsible for the consequences, politically and militarily.""



>The Trump administration in February 2020 negotiated a withdrawal agreement with the Taliban that excluded the Afghan government, freed 5,000 imprisoned Taliban soldiers and set a date certain of May 1, 2021, for the final withdrawal.

>And the Trump administration kept to the pact, reducing U.S. troop levels from about 13,000 to 2,500, even though the Taliban continued to attack Afghan government forces and welcomed al-Qaeda terrorists into the Taliban leadership.


>Biden delayed the May 1 withdrawal date that he inherited. But ultimately his administration pushed ahead with a plan to withdraw by Aug. 31, despite obvious signs that the Taliban wasn‚Äôt complying with the agreement and had a stated goal to create an ‚ÄúIslamic government‚Äù in Afghanistan after the U.S. left, even if it meant it had to ‚Äúcontinue our war to achieve our goal.‚Äù

The Texas 'heartbeat ban' isn't medically accurate because there's no heart that early in pregnancy, providers say

Many women don't know they're pregnant at 6 weeks, when a pregnancy is still an embryo.¬†HUIZENG HU/ Getty Images

""Heartbeat bills"" are misnomers because there's no heart nor beating at 6 weeks of pregnancy.¬†

Doctors can only detect fluttering cells that will become the heart, and call it ""cardiac motion.""¬†

A 6-week pregnancy is an embryo, not a fetus, and fetal heart development is a continuum.¬†

The new¬†Texas law banning abortions after 6 weeks of pregnancy,¬†like others like it, is often referred to as a ""heartbeat bill,"" indicating a cutoff point when doctors can detect a fetal heartbeat.¬†

As Texas Governor Greg Abbot¬†said in a Facebook video¬†right before signing the bill, it ""ensures that the life of every unborn child who has a heartbeat will be saved from the ravages of abortion."" The law is expected to be challenged and, if it prevails, will go into effect September 1, 2021.¬†

But¬†Dr. Bhavik Kumar, a family medicine physician and abortion provider at the Planned Parenthood Center for Choice in Houston, told Insider ""pregnancies this early do not have a beating heart"" ‚Äî and that's a medical fact.¬†

For one, a pregnancy that's six weeks along is still an embryo. It's not a fetus until the 9th week after conception or 11th week after the last menstrual period, according to¬†Healthline.¬†

Plus, most women don't even know they're pregnant at six weeks, let alone get a doctor's appointment to confirm it.¬†

""At six weeks, most women would not have any clue they were even pregnant if they weren't carefully tracking menstrual cycles, and that doesn't even take into account the millions of women with irregular cycles who might go six weeks or longer between periods as a normal part of their life,"" Dr. Stephanie Ros, an OB-GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of South Florida, told Insider.¬†

She said at that point, the embryo is a quarter-inch long. ""It's barely noticeable on ultrasound, we often have to use transvaginal ultrasound to be able to see it at all,"" she said.¬†

What's really happening is 'cardiac motion' from cells that will become the heart

The so-called ""heartbeat"" that's detected at six weeks isn't a heart nor is it beating. ""There's electrical activity within cells that will become a heart, and we see that on an ultrasound machine as a flickering that can be audible through the machine,"" Kumar said. ""We refer to that as cardiac motion.""¬†

""Certainly different people have different feelings around seeing that and what that means,"" Kumar added, ""and that is up to each person to decide how they value that.""¬†

Indeed, the president of the¬†American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which represents more than 60,000 OB-GYNs in the US,¬†made a similar point in 2019¬†in opposition to ""heartbeat bills.""

""Pregnancy and fetal development are a continuum,"" he said. ""What is interpreted as a heartbeat in these bills is actually electrically induced flickering of a portion of the fetal tissue that will become the heart as the embryo develops."" That tissue continues to develop throughout the first trimester.¬†

Only in the past few decades has the technology been advanced enough to detect cardiac motion that early, Dr. Saima Aftab, medical director of the Fetal Care Center at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami,¬†told LiveScience in 2019. The fluttering, she said, also doesn't indicate the viability of the future heart or the pregnancy.¬†"

Don't run off to the hospital wanting to get cured or saved. Be a grown up and deal with the consequences of your choices. Fucking assholes. 

I don't want people to die, but I am tired of others not getting the care they need because some dumbass is ""vaccine hesitant"" or as I like to say it ""a fucking moron""."

0,"Thank you. During the primaries last year, I watched CNN, Fox, and I think ABC news collectively. The biased opinions on all the networks truly just turned me away from it all. It made me skeptical of all news outlets to be honest, including online news outlets. I just don‚Äôt know what news source is truly unbiased so I have just stayed away from it all. I read Yahoo‚Äôs daily email news updates and listen to local radio stations. Reddit is the closest form of social media I have ever took part in. I had a MySpace back when that was a thing but before this, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever had. The one main thing I am certain of that I have learned over the past to 5 years is a lot of things I had trust in before, I don‚Äôt anymore. It‚Äôs disheartening to say but it‚Äôs something I can hopefully see change in my lifetime. But thank you again for pointing me in a direction I can seek news to help stay on top of current events better. I know to you, it might not be much but to me, it really means a lot.

It is true both sides have their derps, we just need to reel them in. I remember being 'shut down' by someone on the left calling me a climate change denier because I said renewables can't fill our energy needs.

And I get that nothing is being done if you do nothing... But sometimes if you're given two shitty options I'd rather we do the least shitty one. 

As an example, let's say we told two people to each pick up a cinder block and carry it 100m east. If one person is fiddling with the block and then walking 30m south, and the other is kind of sitting there... That would mean the person sitting there is putting us in a better position.  That's how I view it; if we spend ungodly sums of money in renewable tech that won't solve the problem were essentially wasting money. Don't get me wrong, I think the gov should be, in general, supporting tech advancements... But we need to prioritize. If we took half the renewable funds and gave it to the scientists and engineers trying to make  nuclear stations cheaper or faster to construct, it would have actually made a dent.

‚Äî Even homosexual activists don‚Äôt try to hide the connection with pedophilia. In The Gay Report ‚Äî a book published back in 1979 ‚Äî authors Karla Jay and Allen Young found that 73 percent of those surveyed had had sexual relations with males 16 to 19 or younger.  
\_\_ a 1991 population study by the U.S. Department of Commerce. It showed that 8 million girls were abused by age 18 by heterosexual men, a ratio of 1 victim to 11 adult men. However, 6-8 million boys were abused by age 18 by 1-2 million adult homosexuals, a ratio of 3-5 victims for every gay adult.  
\_\_ In a study published in 1987 in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence, psychologist Dr. Gene Able, director of the Behavioral Sciences Institute in Atlanta said homosexuals sexually molest young boys with an incidence five times greater than the molestation of girls."

1 often capitalized : a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition

By that definition alone Trump was not a fascist , I don‚Äôt believe that Trump whipped up the conservatives to fascism, conservatives are by nature and definition conservative.

When you attack and ban someone for wearing a political hat, or show up up a rally merely to disrupt it because of the political differences, that‚Äôs not democracy. You could say both parties are guilty ( talking US here) but as a sideliner I would say the left went overboard. In Canada there have been people ripping up or stealing Conservative election signs. I haven‚Äôt seen or heard of the opposite happening. And saying you must rise up and become intolerant to defeat intolerance, that‚Äôs trying to justify violence. Ask yourself this, What is democracy, what is it‚Äôs goal, Democracy works when all sides get their say and a compromise is worked out, would you say this is what‚Äôs happening in the U.S. right now, 

I suspect you and I will never agree on these fundamentals and that‚Äôs fine ‚Äú I disagree with your political views but I will defend your right to have them‚Äù, I expect no less from others."

1,"I am Australian, living in Tasmania. The entire country is not locked down, and is not in as much trouble as you indicate in this report. It is true though that Melbourne, which is the capital of Victoria, has been in a mountain of trouble for a long time. Their Premier is a champion of China, and our Prime Minister has more than once had to step in and stop him selling his State out to them! Things are out of hand there, and the Police need to look at their role there, and rethink how they should be reacting to the public. The military as well, although so far they have had a limited role to play.
America is very much in the same situation in the blue states especially, but your Federal government and your President are showing that they are the enemies of the people, and an urgent intervention is needed. All I can see to help you all right now, is a military coup, so they can settle the country down, and call for a new election, country wide. As bad as things are in some states here, your country in rapidly slipping through your fingers, and once it is gone, there will be no way to get it back. PLEASE arrest your Commander in Chief, and your State Dept heads, immediately, and lock them up until trials can be held. They, and others have shown their treasonous behavior, and must be secured before they cause more death and destruction, inside and outside of America.
BTW the rest of Australia is handling the Covid crap a bit better than Melbourne, although NSW, our largest state, seem like they have swallowed the crazy pills as well and are going quite feral at the moment. I am beginning to wonder just how many of these people are being off to do the things they do, by China most likely. I am so glad I am the age I am, and that I am not afraid of death, having huge faith in Jesus, but I do feel sorry for the younger ones, and what the future holds for them, it is heart breaking to think about.

0,"Eh Republicans and their base have been this way for a long time. Starting in the 70s under Nixon, when he promoted tough on crime, anti drug hysteria and appealed to white southern evangelical Christians. So naturally they‚Äôd be skeptical of minorities and immigrants. 

But that being said, there was a fairly sizable moderate so called Rockefeller wing of the Republican Party, who were fiscally conservative but socially moderate and supported new deal type policies.

But starting in the 80s, Reagan definitely promoted government skepticism and conservative policies. Then the 90s with Newt led us down the toxic, polarized path we are in today.

Trump imo is the symptom, not the cause of this populist conservative movement. He exploited fears about immigrants, minorities, and promoted his tough on crime rhetoric. And the GOP establishment failed to reach out to their voters and quell their populist tendencies, which made it easy for a Trump like demagogue to take over.

Now, the Republican Party is unmoored from reality. Between the covert xenophobia, racism, unpopular policies, conspiracy theories, peddling the big lie and embracing autocratic leaders and hostile foreign governments. 

Once again, the Trump era was more of a symptom than cause of what the current conservative movement is."

You mentioned before that it's wrong for people to be born into shitty situations because someone doesn't feel they are ready to be a parent. But I've never met someone who grew up in a tough home that wishes they were aborted instead. I guess most people just want to live as a general rule. Most people end up doing their best for their kids regardless of whether or not they wanted to be parents.

The thing IS tragic. It's an exception to policy I would be content with, if for nothing else than to show support for a little compromise. But the reason why it isn't an exception likely circles back to the idea that you're condemning a seperate living being to death for a crime it had no part or say in. It's life is no less precious or valuable than any other. I think a reasonable counter argument could be made that if you were a victim of assault and got pregnant, you did not consent to the creation of that life and you shouldn't necessarily be responsible for carrying it to term."

1,"Thank you for your questions. As before I think those are important questions to ask especially since they can have a big impact on the lives of people involved. 
Would you expand on what sex education would look like? I think I would agree that sex education is important. I don't always agree with how it is put into practice (for example I live in a state that begins sex education in kindergarten. In my opinion that is far too early to begin discussing that topic). So if you clarify what you would desire in that regard, I could give you my opinion in that area. 
In regards to your point on abstinence verses other options, my personal belief is that sex is something reserved for marriage. In holding that view, I acknowledge that others do not hold that view. So I would hold abstinence as the ideal. That's what I believe people should do, but since they aren't going to, providing instruction in the other areas would be beneficial, but I would still emphasize the ideal. I don't believe contraceptives are wrong, I just don't think they are best before marriage. 
I think another reason abstinence is promoted over the other options is that no matter how effective the other options are, there is still a chance that it doesn't work, while with abstinence, it should be entirely effective because if you don't participate in the act that gets you pregnant, you can't get pregnant. Actions have consequences, if you do not want to be pregnant or to deal with a child, the most effective way to prevent that is to avoid participating in the activity that results in pregnancy. If you participate in that activity, you risk the result. 
I don't know that this specifically answers your questing, but one objection I personally would have to welfare being used as a solution is I don't believe it is the government's job to take care of children whose parents would struggle to provide for them. Instead I would say it is the responsibility of the people in that community to come alongside that mother and assist her in the provision and raising of that child. One of the ways this manifests is through charity like Pregnancy Resource Center and individuals seeing the need of that mother and child. 
If a person is truly holding to the pro-life view, they must continue to value the life of that child after they are born and so must be willing to do what it takes to protect that life. The child doesn't cease to be valuable as a human just because they have left the protection of their mother's womb. 
As before I hope I was helpful. If you have any questions or would like clarification, you are welcome to dm me. Thank you for your time."

History tells us what our founding fathers thought of such a government entity when they gave King George V a big ‚ÄúF ¬†you‚Äù when they signed the Declaration of Independence. Today we have ¬†a Supreme Court that is governing just like a king, using judicial decrees to make law, a form of judicial activism that has no legitimate place in the highest court of the land.

No longer should Supreme Court justices be nominated by the president and then approved by the senate.

0,"I exaggerate only slightly: I am thirty years old.  Republicans have NEVER been on the noble, virtuous, or good side of any issue or event in my entire life.  Their response to any problem, at best, is neutral.  Most of the time, it is the literal opposite of what they should be doing.

Meanwhile, Democrats miss a lot too -- in many ways they behave similarly to the GOP, but almost never worse.  Like the GOP, few are interested in dismantling harmful and toxic elements of capitalism like stock markets, declining union membership, privatized government services, a bloated ""defense"" budget, etc.  They still want to advance the American Empire, and all the blood that goes along with it.

I get so tired of seeing people talk shit about Biden for all of this. There's very little he could have personally done in his capacity as president to stop the wheels that were in motion already.

The state department and military have had plenty of time pre-Biden to make arrangements to get everyone and their families out that needed to be evacuated. American civilians had plenty of time to make arrangements to leave.

Foreign Policy and having technocratic, qualified in positions for things like this don't happen was supposed to be a strength of Biden. 

At least salvage a few conditions before handing it back to the Taliban, women's rights and maybe allowed there to be military contractors and some measures to ensure the US can protect itself from a blindside attack, as well as get people that risked their lives to help us out safely. 

Easier said than done and the US didn't have much leverage in peace talks either way and it didn't sound like the talks with the Taiiban were going anywhere so I guess we really don't know. 

Biden is left holding the bag that was mostly left by the previous 3 Administrations and 20 years of decisions that lead up to this point.

1,"You are absolutely right about that.  Most people and even the dictionary have no clue what liberal is.

adjective
1.
willing to respect or accept behavior or opinions different from one's own; open to new ideas.
2.
relating to or denoting a political and social philosophy that promotes individual rights, civil liberties, democracy, and free enterprise.

noun
1.
a supporter of policies that are socially progressive and promote social welfare.
2.
a supporter of a political and social philosophy that promotes individual rights, civil liberties, democracy, and free enterprise.

As an adjective, socialists that call themselves liberal in practice are nothing that resembles liberal. 

As a noun, it is impossible to support policies that are socially progressive and promote social welfare, socialist, while at the same time promotes individual rights, civil liberties, democracy and free enterprise.

Conservatives and libertarians are actually for individual rights, civil liberties, democracy and free enterprise.  The left are just a bunch of idiots that support Marxist oligarchs and lawmakers, which is against, individual rights, civil liberties democracy and free enterprise.

Please stop calling these idiots liberals, because they are not, the are idiots.  The Oligarchs and lawmakers are Marxist progressives.  They will tell how to live and do what it takes so you fall in line, while they live free, burning carbon in their lavish homes and jet setting around the world in their private jets with their private security, enjoying big soir√©es without mandates, and providing a great education for their kids, while ours get indoctrination."

0,"The idea is that if you go far enough Left and Right you become authoritarian (normally Nazi Germany and other far-right regimes are compared with Soviet Russia and other far left governments.) To further complicate the idea will be people who point out that the Nazis are National *Socialists* and Communist governments are normally formed on transitioning from a capitalist to a socialist to an eventual communist party. In addition, the Soviet - Nazi treaty that predates WW2 is shown as evidence that the Far Left and the Far Right are the same.

Now, any in-depth analysis will show that this is idiotic. There are differences from the Far Left and the Far Right in the same way that there are similarities between the Far Right and Centrists and between Centrists and the Far Left.

First off is The authoritarian stand point. Yes, both Far Left and Far Right societies often limit civil rights, particularly free speech, while Centrists are seen as paragons of civil rights. This of course ignores the US‚Äô atrocious history of even Centrists going along with slavery, Jim Crow, the Sedition Acts and the Smith Act, Centrists Europe appeasing Hitler and not allying with the Soviet Union when the USSR wanted to (before Hitler and Stalin ever talked), and the entire history of imperialism. Every single country has a history of reducing or surprising individual rights to maintain their power, so the idea that somehow this is only limited to the Far Left and Far Right is idiotic (unless we‚Äôre going to start counting modern Germany and England either Fascist or Socialist for their strong anti-Nazi and strong Libel laws respectively.)

Second is the idea that both Nazis and the USSR were socialists and were the same. This is again wrong with any amount of analysis. What is true: The Nazis called themselves (National) Socialists and did have some members who were focused on having a strong welfare and more populist power (Look up Strasserism.) This faction and the other faction, which was Hitler‚Äôs faction, were unified in their hatred of Jews. Hitler blamed Jews for the loss of world war 1 and the fall of the German Empire, while Strasserists believed that the heads of Capitalism we‚Äôre all Jews and oppressed and abused the workers. However as Hitler gained more power and talked less and less about welfare, the Strasserites were not pleased and attempted to oust Hitler. They lost, and many were eventually killed in the Night of Long Knives. In addition, Hitler was always staunchly anti-Communist, while the USSR was fully pro-Communist (even if there was and still is disagreement for how to get to a Communist state.) So even though Nazis borrowed some of the language and did have some members who were pro-workers, it was never a central tenet of Nazism and they were in fact often openly antagonistic towards Socialists And Communists.

Now, the other main point people will bring up is the high death rate. Most people have heard of the 6 million Jews killed by Hitler and the some 5 million disabled people, Romani, Communists, and other groups killed by Nazis. Many people have also heard of both the Holodomor and the Great Leap Forward in China. These are used as proof that the highest deaths rates are a definining trait of both the Far Left and the Far Right. Again though, more analysis shows some discrepancies. First off, there are plenty of instances of high death rates caused by non Far-Left or Far-Right groups, including the Famine of India caused by Churchill‚Äôs policies and the US‚Äô extermination of Native Americans. Most people wouldnt call Lincoln either a Communist or a Nazi, but he still presided over the largest mass hanging in US history where a large number of Native Americans were hanged for bullshit charges. In addition, more context adds more differences between Far Left and Far Right high death numbers. The Holodomor and the Great Leap Forward are generally called failures of policy that were part of attempts to rapidly industrialize countries that were incredibly rural. Both China and Russia have an incredibly long history of famines. Aside from World War 2 though neither country has had a major famine since these events though, which means these strategies either stopped or were changed to prevent further famine and mass death. The Holocaust on the other hand would be unlikely to be considered a ‚Äôfailure‚Äô or policy though, unless from the perspective of it not killing more people. The intention does matter, even if the end results seem similar at first. (And before anyone says anything yes, there were absolutely some deaths that were intentional and dissenters were killed or worked to death. This is different than a mass genocide however by both scope and scale.) Again though, the US, a supposedly non-far right or far left Country has a long history of mass deaths. Aside from Native Americans in the US, theres also the direct US support of the Contras in Nicaragua, the Indonesian anti-communist massacres, Pol Pot in Cambodia, the Taliban during the Afghan Soviet War, and more. If mass killings are a defining characteristic of either the Far Left or the Far Right, then how does that reconcile with the millions dead at the hands of America? (Hint: it doesn‚Äôt.)

Now, does this all mean that there are no similarities? Of course not. There are similarities and differences between all ideologies from the anti-capitalism of Fascism and Communism to the anti-authoritarianism of Anarchists and Libertarians to the desire for a better health care system between Joe Biden, current Communists, and Otto con Bismarck (who was a monarchist and absolutely was not pro-Democracy, much less Communism.) The most prevalent right now being that both the Far Left and the Far Right are antagonistic towards our current mode of Democracy. However the end goals are absolutely different (Far Right wanting an Even higher concentration of power in specific people while the Far Left wanting both our workplaces and our government more democratized.) This would be like both a pedophile and someone who hates kids being the same because they avoid children. On the surface, both may stay away. But one is doing it because they don‚Äôt want the temptation or to be arrested, while the other just thinks kids are gross.

Last point, in addition to horse shoe theory there is also fishhook theory that Dem centrists are closer to the Fat Right than the Far Left despite espousing similar goals. Does that mean that this theory is more righ based on what I‚Äôve said? Sometimes. Both Dems and Nazis want limits to worker‚Äôs rights (Dems in the form of capitalism and Nazis in fascism) and both tend to be fiercely anti-Communist. But, as I stated before, some similarities do not make two things the same (otherwise no one would consider anarchists, who are often very anti-communist, to be Far Left.) Unfortunately humans are just too complicated for that and while the theories can help us better explain some things‚Ä¶they‚Äôre not universal either.

For the record I‚Äôm Far Left and I say fuck Nazis the most, and fuck Centrists who are letting the world burn. Are you both the same? No. Would I rather have a Dem president than a Republican one? Absolutely, and I voted for Biden. But I‚Äôd rather have universal health care and no climate crisis more, and neither party has done the first or stopped the second."

0,"In California, a recall election can be put into motion solely by getting a petition signed by a proportion of state citizens equal to or greater than 12% of the number of voters in the previous office election. As such, to force a recall election of Gavin Newsom--who won with 62% of the vote in 2018--only required 1.4 million signatures, or 3.5% of California's population. The recall is costing California $276 million and represents an attempted power grab by Republicans to take advantage of a non-regular election to unseat the democratically-elected governor.

According to the law, the recall is based on two questions: question one is a yes or no question about recalling Gavin Newsom, and question two is who would replace him were the yes vote to receive a plurality of the vote. So, technically, 3.5% of the population forces the other 96.5% to turn out in an irregular election to vote ""no"" by a plurality, or the most popular ""other"" candidate running (currently Republican Larry Elder with about 26% popularity) becomes governor. If a plurality votes ""yes,"" regardless of who they prefer, a candidate with less than 30% popularity can supplant the governor elected with over twice that popularity during a standard, regular election."

The Supreme Court in brazil is the biggest joke there ever was, it needs to be completely reformed (The US supreme court should also be reformed, by the way)
The brazilians have a supreme court where ANY lawyer, appointed by a POLITICIAN can become a member, no need to be a judge, no need to be someone suited for the job, and that is a lifetime position! ANY supreme court that is unbiased and trustworthy need to be populated by FEDERAL JUDGES, appointe by election amongst all federal judges in the country, and I said JUDGES, not mere, ill-prepared lawyers. The political appointment process needs to be eliminated, and until it is so, no one will trust the courts. (that holds true in Brazil, US or any democracy).
Also, the voting issue, Bolsonaro is for electronic PLUS paper ballot, so it could be audited, similarly to the US...imagine an election where the electronic votes could not be audited? Yes, that is Brazil. But guess, the brazilian (comunists-inclined) opposition is against that. There is no transparency throughout society, and a society that has its powers opaque to its population, is a democracy of the rich and powerful, (like Russia, Belarus, China....and the list goes on) and all of these countries, including Brazil and US are heading that way unless structural changes are made....and those are usually painful.

0,"Do you know how much an abortion at planned parent hood or some other abortion clinic is? Honest question I do not know. I found planned parent hood says it could be $0-$1,500. but I am not sure what other places charge, I know in a hospital it can be 5,000 or a bit more for vaginal birth or higher for C-section. How can any women really afford a abortion then or delivery period then? 

You talk about How does that (to put it bluntly) undestroy their body? or the trauma of childbirth? How does that stop the postpartem depression or the body disphoria.  Have you seen the side effects of both a hormonal pill abortion or a medical abortion? For hormonal pill, it is not unusual for a women having to go to the hospital because the bleeding does not stop, but continues to get worse. Some women become sick and mentally damaged seeing that amount of blood and the cells of the baby after cleaning up that mess, During the surgical abortion where they stick a vacuum up there, it is not unusual for the doctor to cause damage to the uterus and other organs that actuary harm the chance of having another baby in the future, along with bleeding, and causing tears that might need to be surgically fixed. So you will have to go to the hospital for surgery. which case is all traumatic in my opinion. and more of an economic burden now they have more bills to pay. (not saying vaginal birth or C-section is better they all have their risk too)

to your other argument, why cant an employer higher a temp from an agency? There are temp agency that people do sign up with to find part time work, they usually work part time or full time during a short period of work, do you think those short term workers would like to have that job for a bit?"

 Fauci treatment  by Trump was a total discraced, Humiliated by a Neandrathol  peace of shit.

 Trump was blackmailing  China for trademarks,  destroying the chip industry , and  fishing for info on the China lab science . Faucci may never get close enough again to know what the truth is about the origins of covid.

So, please pardon me if I'm not one of the folks this sub is supposed to be for.  But I just feel it necessary to point out how intellectually bizarre the rhetoric against Ivermectin is.

Now, I'm not an anti-vax guy.  I've had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine and have no problem getting a booster if it's necessary.  I was also one of the first people in my state to get COVID in March of last year.  But I respect everybody's choice about what to do with their own bodies.  I'm not taking a position against anyone's rights or decisions.  The point I'm making is solely to reveal what I believe to be an intellectual weakness in the anti-Ivermectin crowd's arguments.

The anti-Ivermectin crowd rails against it because it's ""not meant for humans"" and other similar arguments.  However, Ivermectin is FDA-approved for human use.  And do you know what is **not** FDA-approved?  **The vaccine.**  

So, here you have these people insulting your intelligence over the fact that some folks are taking a drug originally not meant for humans but that eventually became FDA-approved for human use and recognized as having legitimate, beneficial uses in humans.  But those same people are out there pushing crazy ideas like vaccine mandates and prison time if you don't get a substance shot into your arm that is **not** FDA-approved.  

I'm not usually one to just lay into somebody and call them dumb, but in this case, I think it's safe to say that many of these anti-Ivermectin people are, in fact, dumb.  At the very least, they fail to see the intellectual inconsistencies in their positions.  One can only assume that if those same people were diagnosed with a blood clotting disorder that they would refuse to allow a doctor to prescribe them Warfarin.  You know, since Warfarin is rat poison."

0,"That article is from July 2020, before the vaccines were released. Last updated in Dec 2020.

Herd immunity comes at a percentage 1 - The R0 of covid-delta is about 5. So, we need 80% of people who are basically immune to achieve it. Now, recent trends indicate that even vaccinated people can spread it if they get it, but they don't really get it very easily (that is, like 5% of vaccinated people get it and spread it). I don't know the math for compensating for that issue, but if 90% of people get the vaccine, I'm guessing we will be out of any real danger.

Note that the recent outbreak in Provincetown, RI, died out on its own due to herd immunity caused by a high vaccination rate. That's all herd immunity is good for; it won't prevent people getting it, it'll just prevent it from spreading exponentially in a population once people get it."

1,"On 6 Jan 2021 the Congress was discussing the possibility of an illegal election. Before the 1st protested state, Arizona, had the full evidence of the irregularities exposed... a fully orchestrated, illegal, domestic terrorist backed riot took place in the Capitol. The intent of the ""deep state"" was realized when the riot stopped the legitimate debate on the issue at hand. Congress was evacuated and the debate stopped. The Capitol was cleared of rioters, and later that evening, Congress returned and, as expected, the fire for finding the problem had burned out, as the ""deep state"" planned it. There are videos of Capitol Police waving the protestors onto the Capitol lawn and into the building. According to some, facial recognition software has identified ""Antifa"" members in the rioting crowd. As they did in the summer riots, normally peaceful people were antagonized by the anti fascists and followed along. The end result was attained... justifying the means. Debate stopped and Biden was certified by unchallenged slates of electoral votes. The Georgia challenge and the few challenges that came afterward received overwhelming votes against and the electoral protest procedure was halted in tis tracks. Not unexpectedly, there were soon calls from the left for V.P. Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the POTUS... and if he doesn't agree, we will start impeachment proceedings. The ""deep state"" has tried for 4 years to remove Donald J. Trump from office an they will not stop... even 12 days before the end of his term. ""He is dangerous!"", they say. ""He incited a riot!"", they say. The truth is, that with the intelligence that he still has access to... he is a threat to their illegal livelihood and has been for 4 years. It scares them to death that their truths may be revealed. For the left and the deep state, it is truly a matter of life and death to remove Trump. As Hillary Clinton said, (paraphrased), ""If that S.O.B. gets elected, we'll all hang by nooses."" Truer words were never spoken. Donald Trump was not as vindictive as he should have been, and he allowed them to slide. BIG MISTAKE!!!! A majority of the left and a goodly portion of the right are involved in enriching themselves from activities that are surely less than above board in the USA. They all fear the consequences. Some would surely face death for their crimes. We can only pray that justice will be served."

Ballot images prove the same ballots were scanned multiple times in Georgia







--------------------

First: Fulton County Concedes 19,000 mail in votes (90% for Biden) do not have legally required chain of custody.

Even under the illegally imposed consent decree Sect. of State Raffensperger and Stacey Abrams placed on Fulton County those votes do not count. They should have been set aside. 

This means - Biden lost the Presidential election and Perdue won by a margin that did not require a run-off. 

Second: Evidence emerged today that the Fulton County Election Board was staffed with Temporary workers from Happy Faces Personnel Group. That company is controlled and financed by STACEY ABRAMS. 

Fulton County residents testified Stacey Abrams owns 16% of ‚ÄòNow Account‚Äô, and that Now Account financed and recruited employees for Happy Faces.

The Election Counting in Fulton County was controlled by the main Democratic Operative in the State.

Third: There is a huge story breaking tomorrow... While Raffensperger was publicly claiming the election was beyond reproach, internal documents from his office show that they were aware of problems with Fulton county. 

Problem: Missing Batches Numbers of Mail in Ballots. 
Problem: Boxes of Ballots that did not have seals as legally required. 
Problem: Repeated counts multiple times in a row. 
example: 
Batch A 390 Biden 100 Trump 10 Libertarian
Batch B 390 Biden 100 Trump 10 Libertarian
Batch C 390 Biden 100 Trump 10 Libertarian
Batch D 390 Biden 100 Trump 10 Libertarian

- statistical impossibility, and Raffensperger ignored it. 





Georgia BOMBSHELL Analysis - Biden takes Minimum 98% of a 23,487 vote batch at 12:18AM - Impossible!


WATCH THE FIRST MINUTE

STRONG EVIDENCE OF FRAUD

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Biden's lead in Georgia is only 12,781 votes.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†This analysis is based on official timestamped election night data from Edison Research which was obtained from the NYT website.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†This batch of 23,487 votes went, at an absolute minimum accounting for all decimal places, 97.9779% for Biden.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†This batch was uploaded at 12:18AM EST on Nov 4 (election results began the evening of Nov 3).
‚Ä¢	‚Å†This is not a case of updating one candidate at a time; we can see from looking at the surrounding batches that Trump did not receive any corresponding entries.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†According to official data released by the state of Georgia, the county in which Biden received the highest percentage of total absentee by mail votes was Dekalb County at 86.39%.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†That makes this batch of votes extremely suspect, even if every single allowance is made with the minimum number of votes gained and assuming it's 100% mail in from the most heavily D county.

The ballots that comprised this batch should and must be obtained and independently audited (i.e. not by city officials) as soon as possible.

Nine witnesses of the recently completed Georgia audit including at least one registered Democrat swore to have seen suspiciously pristine, uncreased mail ballots, uniformly and perfectly filled out, almost always for Biden. In one case, a batch of such ballots included 500 ballots in a row all cast for Biden. Is there a relation?




Voter Group in Georgia Has Identified More than 50,000 Illegal Votes


GEORGIA: 2,056 felons illegally voted; 66,248 under 18 voted; 2,423 weren‚Äôt registered at all; 1,043 used a PO Box; 4,926 voted past the reg. date; 10,315 died before the election, 15,700 moved out of state, 40,279 changed county and didn‚Äôt re-register to vote

In Georgia, ballots where the voter ONLY voted for President:
‚Ä¢ Trump: 818
‚Ä¢ Biden: 95,801

Ballots where the voter voted for President and at least one other race:
‚Ä¢ Trump: 2,456,915
‚Ä¢ Biden: 2,376,081


Georgia recount worker with 20 years of experience handling ballots described an odd batch that stood out ""there was a different feel."" ""Pristine"" sheets ""difference in the texture of the paper"" with ""no markings"" and *98% For Biden


Georgia ballots rejected by machines were later altered by election workers to count 


Let's speculate....

1. They made it impossible to disregard mail in ballots


2. The software changed the votes

3. Mail in ballots were fabricated to equal the digital read outs

4. Ballots (both real and made up) were counted

5. Then the same ballots were recounted. 

Georgia Recount Witnesses Saw Trump Votes Counted for Biden Affiants also swore to have seen suspiciously pristine, uncreased mail ballots, uniformly and perfectly filled out

The more I think about the more I think this was going to happen at some point with chaos at the airport. It would‚Äôve been moral, ethical, and right thing to do and evacuate everyone who deserved to get out I think as the threat loomed and closing in the more likely people would see everyone else panic and panic themselves. It feeds off itself. 

I think the bigger issue is the intelligence failure. Was it lack of info, oversight, bad communication, bad analysis? 

I think a lot can be explained by the human element of how things have gone. The Afghan army just took off because they were basically expected to lose sooner or later. So whether that comes when the taliban shows up at their door or they try to hold them off, the soldiers were being asked to fight a losing fight and die for nothing away from their families. 

I imagine a few just said I‚Äôm out and then no one trusted that they had the support of their fellow soldiers so they just left too. Once the ball started rolling and the top people started leaving the dam broke. 

It may not be a satisfying answer but it was going to be chaotic and messy at best, and this is far from the best case, it definitely could have been much worse. 

The intel failures are what worry me."

1957 - Jim Crow was still in effect.  The 24th Amendment, outlawing poll taxes as a means of preventing black people from voting, had not yet been passed.  Segregation and ""whites only"" facilities were still the reality in most places, even though SCOTUS had struck down ""separate but equal"" in Brown vs. Board of Education in 1954.

LBJ is talking about giving black people a token victory with the watered-down 1957 Civil Rights Act, as a means of staving off white Democrats losing all of the above referenced issues immediately.  The ""Reconstruction"" he's fearmongering about is the period after the end of the Civil War, when northern Republicans ran the southern states to prevent the Democrats from recreating slavery without actually owning people - which is exactly what the Democrats did after Reconstruction ended.

1,"Ok, so to be clear, I gave you an opportunity to defend your statement that this table is false. And you essentially refuse to take it, saying you don't care to research the topic and based on your edit only spoke up in defiance of the information because you want to mirror republican behavior.

But like I said, and proved, above. When we disagree we often have evidence to back it up. We don't disagree because the information provided hurt our feelings.

Also you say stats can be and are manipulated. I 100% agree with you. I have an example.

The other day I saw a news clip that said, ""vaccinated people have a 99.999% survival rate. Unvaccinated people are 25 times more likely to die"" that sounds drastic! 99.999% survival rate vs 25 times more likely to die... Let's do that math.

100 - 99.999 = 0.001 (chance of death while vaccinated)

0.001 x 25 = 0.025 (25 times more likely to die while unvaccinated)

100 - 0.025 = 99.975% chance of survival for unvaccinated people.

Yet people are losing careers over vaccine mandates... For a vaccine that doesn't prevent you from contracting or transmitting. It doesn't even prevent you from dying. For an experimental technology (mRNA) that has never gone past lab trials before this year so there is ZERO long term effect studies.

To provide an example where a large event did cause some labor problems look at WW1. The war depopulated entire villages, but even that was due in large part to poor conscription and assignment practices. It saw around 20 million dead spread across Europe and other participating nations.

The black death also caused some labor shortages, but again it killed way more people. Estimated around 25 million.

Agree with u again, financial worth isn‚Äôt decided by you, it‚Äôs decided by the people paying you, and companies make less money the more they pay their employees. No one should be working for an unliveable wage, and since minimum wage hasn‚Äôt exactly continued to be proportional to the cost of living, many people ARE working for less than their worth. People are realizing they are worth more, and hopefully more and more people will realize in the near future. Maybe you don‚Äôt deserve a  $10 million salary, but you certainly deserve more than you make now, as does everyone else on the fucking planet. Your concept of financial worth works, but the people on the other side think everyone is worth pay as little as they can get away with.

Not everyone can just go work 70-90 hours of work or school, and I think the ‚Äújust get a job‚Äù argument is one of the dumbest and most impractical pieces of advice.

1,"> If i understand you correctly, the problem with 1. seem more of a social issue than economic issue.

No, its economic.  The amount Yang was talking about was $1000 per month, and Yang was talking about getting people off welfare by moving them to UBI.  Very few people can live off $12,000 per year, so they'd still need to have another source of income.  Nobody would voluntarily switch from welfare to UBI - they make far more on welfare - and if forced, they would riot.  So we're talking about UBI *in addition to* welfare.

> And with 2. has it been calculated before?

328 million people times $1000 per month is $4 trillion per year - which just happens to be about the same as our total Federal revenues.  It would leave nothing left to pay for the rest of government.  Even getting rid of welfare would just reduce the amount of programs you can't pay for.

> is it really doomed? Why not give it a try?

It is really doomed.  It has been tried, and the effects were exactly what conservatives warned about.  If the amount was high enough to live on, not only was it even less affordable, people simply stopped working."

It's a traditional shot, using the same basic ideas as many shots before it, [it does not contain aborted fetal tissue] ( and it's basically as effective at preventing death and severe consequences as the other vaccines.

Not sure who I'm trying to convince, but as you can tell, I'm on an immunosuppressant also. Looking into getting a booster, if I do in fact need one. Also know someone fairly close to me, arround that same age, that's refusing to get the vaccine because they ""always have bad reactions"" to things (nevermind how bad the reaction from COVID is likely to be, given their other medical issues).

Regarding if you're allergic or something, I think it depends heavily on the reason of the allergy. For example, I've heard that the delivery mechanism for some vaccines essentially use chicken egg or yolk somehow or another, so allergies to that will cause an allergic reaction to certain vaccines, the flu vaccine in particular, I believe (this is all stuff I've heard from others, not first hand knowledge). But I don't believe any of the current COVID vaccines are using a similar delivery method. J&J would be most likely, but I don't know either.

I do know one of the screening questions for getting the vaccine is to the effect of ""have you ever had a severe reaction to a previous vaccine?"" What they ask after that, or whether that's disqualifying by itself, I don't know."

1,"True or not, I don‚Äôt care. What I hate most about these stories is that they are all carefully selected. The reporter had an agenda or message he wanted to get across, and then he found the event to back it up. Surely there were things going on across the world that wasn‚Äôt this. Why is this the step he chose?

There‚Äôs a selection bias.  The media has the agenda and picks and chooses their evidence from a limitless pool of stories."

>Trump might‚Äôve wanted the troops out too but he started a process like he said and it wasn‚Äôt gonna be so abrupt that it would leave the Afghanistani people with no recourse which is what‚Äôs happening now.

If Trump were still in office we would have had the troops out by May, meaning there would have been even less preparation. How is having them out by mid-August ""abrupt""?

Seems like you're looking to blame Biden for anything, and you're willing to do a lot illogical mental gymnastics to do so. The fact is that hateful conservatives like yourself are going to blame Biden anyways, and it doesn't matter that this was Trump's plan to remove troops all along.

Now, the right doesn't have experts. Instead, they say ""don't believe the experts."" They've enshrined ignorance into their religion.

0,"4 Presidents had had their hands in this mess Biden is the least to blame he continued to tell Obama to reduce troop levels Obama didn‚Äôt listen to him and then later realized he has right and followed his advice. The huge failure was Trump bringing the Taliban to Camp David and negotiating with them without even bringing the Afghanistan government to the table. That gave the Taliban power and under the deal Trump had the U.S sign it doesn‚Äôt say that the Taliban can‚Äôt overthrow the Afghanistan government so what they are doing right now doesn‚Äôt violate Trump‚Äôs terrible agreement. Biden new it was a disaster and nothing to celebrate that‚Äôs why he moved the Sept 11 th date. Also the bottom line is the Afghanistan military doesn‚Äôt want us there. They will work for whoever pays them and if they can get two salaries you better believe they will. They have to fight for their country. Instead they give up without a fight and give weapons we have them to the Taliban and then join them. They have literally shot US soldiers in the back while we were trying to train them.

Fauci was and is a moron. He played the same ‚ÄùJust Say No To Drugs"" BE they tried in the 80s to scare people to avoid all drugs.

Will they support giving financial aid to mothers who can't afford the children that they never wanted? I don't hear any mention from them about what they are willing to do to support these unwanted children. 

Why are they silent about helping these unwanted children? Because they don't really care about the children. They only care about punishing women for being sexually active. They want women to suffer because those women aren't conforming to their conservative ideals."

0,"I think that is a very real motivation for many of them.  My parents, otherwise sane and reasonable people, refuse to give Biden credit for anything.

The thing is, this 100% anti-Democrat stance is new.  My parents are lifelong Republicans.  My entire childhood, they voted Republican.  However, they also understood that Republicans screw up and Democrats can be right.

They were vocally against Bush's decision to send troops to Iraq.  They were vocally in support of the ACA and said, numerous times, that they liked Obama.  They didn't always agree with him, but they liked him.

Then came Trump...

Ever since '16, my parents have gone full-out pro-right, anti-left.  My mother attended Trump rallies and talked about how ""compassionate and caring"" he was.  When the '20 election results were announced, my father kept saying ""*if* Biden is elected.""  When Jan. 6 happened, they were quick to say ""we don't know for sure that those were *really* Trump supporters.  They were probably paid actors there to make Trump look bad.""

Now that Biden is in the White House, every little thing is a travesty for them.  Biden could announce that he, personally, has found the cure for all cancers and my parents would find a way to blame him for putting oncologists out of business.

0,"[**War on terror**](

The War on Terror, also known as the Global War on Terrorism and U.S. War on Terror, is an ongoing international military campaign launched by the United States government following the September 11 attacks. The targets of the campaign are primarily Islamist groups located throughout the world, with the most prominent groups being Al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, the Taliban, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, and the various franchise groups of the former two organizations. The naming of the campaign uses a metaphor of war to refer to a variety of actions that do not constitute a specific war as traditionally defined.

0,"First, that was not day one. That was after Trump spent every single day of the pandemic up to that point politicizing it, as he has continued to do.

Second, saying that you'll take medical advice from a scientist but not a politician is not politicizing. It's using common sense.

Third, are you seriously proposing that the anti-vaxxers are taking their cues from only the last sentence of that statement and ignoring the first sentence? If so, they would have to be ignoring not only the statement itself, since doctors have told us to take the vaccine, therefore have taken it and recommend it, but also absolutely everything else have said and done both before and after that statement.

And has Trump ever told anyone to take the vaccine? He even tried to hide the fact that he and his family had taken it. Is Trump out there telling people to take the vaccine now? The vast majority of anti-vaxxers are Trump supporters. If Trump were encouraging people to take the vaccine, they'd be taking it.

The idea that the anti-vaxxers are Democrats who won't take the vaccine because Trump said to take it ‚Äî *that's* what's disingenuous. If you have even a shred of data that suggests that might be the case for any significant number of anti-vaxxers, I'd like to see it.

I honestly can't believe that even you believe that Harris meant that she wouldn't take the vaccine no matter what, simply because Trump took it. I mean, you yourself provided the entire quote. She obviously meant that if Trump's advice opposed the advice of experts, she'd take the advice of experts.

Unless your head is buried in the sand, you know that most anti-vaxxers are Republican Trump supporters. I don't even know why you're making this ridiculous argument.

ETA: It looks Trump was pro-vaccine while he was running for re-election. In December, he tweeted once to tell people to take it. His last day in office he encouraged people to take it but also said he respected their freedom not to take it. In March, under pressure, he repeated his ""take it but freedom"" statement. In July, in Arizona, while bragging that he was responsible for the vaccine, he repeated his ""take it but freedom"" statement again. So he's provided a tiny bit of sporadic encouragement."

From the things you said you liked, you are def more Democrat as Republicans actively want all those to go away.they hate unions. Hate regulations. Hate employee protections. Want no min wage. Want no osha. Want people working more hours and less days off. Democrats don't like big govt they think the govt should be there to help people when they need it and protect people when they can. Gop uses that to con people into saying dems want to control our lives. Which is what they want to do while claiming they are getting govt off people backs. Whatever that means.

Manchin is really the only democrat who can‚Äôt be pressured into caving.  Because he is retiring after this term.


So you figure out a way to keep the filibuster in name only but kneecap it‚Äôs ability to outright stop all legislation like a talking filibuster, a time limit, a limit on the amount of filibusters that can be invoked.


Then, you pass as much sweeping legislation as you can get thru with 50 votes, plus the VP, so that democrats can point to what they have accomplished to voters to motivate turnout


Most importantly you pass a voting rights act to prevent the GOP from gerrymandering, and voter suppressing their way to victory.


Then you have a concerted grass roots effort to ensure higher turnout (as we did in 2018)


In any case, even if we lose one or more houses of Congress in the midterms, we will have accomplished a huge amount.


Yes, Manchin and others might water down some of the proposed legislation but even the more watered down voting rights act that he supported was a game changer."

When a SARS virus enters your body it attacks your cardiovascular system, respiratory system and renal system. Arteriosclerosis, COPD, renal failure and other renal or cardiopulmonary disease processes exacerbate the virulence of covid; most of the victims of covid had some form of extenuating chronic condition. 

Additionally, it‚Äôs transmitted through aerosolized respiratory secretions (similar to tuberculosis) that can only be blocked using an N95 or N100 mask. Months of wearing a mask really wasn‚Äôt enough to stop the spread due to the extreme contagion factor coronavirus has. 

No one on the planet could‚Äôve predicted the virulence of the disease; except Fauci who had ties in the origin of it. During the history of humanity there hasn‚Äôt been a 100% effective way to deal with virulent pandemics. Under Trump‚Äôs leadership a 97% efficacious vaccine was produced; the fastest developed vaccine for a novel virus was produced through Republican legislation. The vaccine has undoubtedly saved countless lives.

If you are anti-science and have those pre-existing health conditions and decide to not get the vaccine, there is a good chance it could kill you. It‚Äôs not up to the government to force feed Americans on their decisions, they have the freedom to get it but every choice has a reaction and it may be negative but it‚Äôs still the basis of our country, individual freedoms."

I get it's a hypocritical situation.  He is a bad person. I upvoted the article. Can we be friends now?"
0,"It is very stupid. I agree.

Also it seems so silly that people feel they need to mention their political leanings when talking about the vaccines. It's not a political thing at all. Even the trump admin was really pushing to get vaccines out asap with operation warp speed. I actually thought the plan for operation warp speed was one of the few bright ideas that administration had. (unfortunately they never followed through on that plan). But vaccines aren't political. They weren't made by the government or by politicians. The science is solid as scientists have been working on caronavirus vaccines for over 20 years. They just used their existing knowledge to make vaccines for this specific strain of caronavirus. I don't even know what people men's when they say there is a controversy around the vaccines. There really isn't. It's just that a lot of people want something to be upset about. And are politicizing something that shouldn't be.

And to be clear I am not criticizing you personally. I am criticizing people who do make the issue of vaccinations political. As long as people keep doing that we will be stuck in the pandemic"

0,"I agree, though I think the ""false advertising"" you could MAYBE charge google with in such a case would be a really minor thing for them EVEN if you could somehow prove standing. Probably need a new law crafted for such a thing for it to matter in any way...

Google, specifically, is a rather interesting one in that it's SO large that it's literally impossible to police via human action (without dedicating like 20% of the population of the planet to working on it)  so any ""policing"" would almost have to be done via changes to the PageRank algorithm... which weirdly enough is an ongoing topic of scientific research. Pagerank gets published not via google's ""disclosures"", but in academic journals.

Currently there is a portion of pagerank which DOES delist... to attempt to stay within compliance of DMCA. This is public information and I don't think Google has ever disputed such a thing. Quite the opposite if anything--if you do a google search for torrents you will often see a ""Further results are blocked by DMCA"". They don't *HAVE* to put that there, it could all happen in the background. They do that on purpose.

Adding hate-speech or perhaps misinformation which has been labeled harmful to the public by the WHO or whatever to that filter might be controversial in some circles, but I **highly** doubt it would make Bing's marketshare rise much. 

There's a reason everyone thinks ""Bing is for Porn""... People know google censors so when that censorship matters to them they switch to bing. Then come right back to Google to search for ""literally anything else"" because, well... Bing is shit."

This belief that life begins at conception has been scientifically backed for years now.

There is a scientific consensus that life begins at conception, or at the very least, early in the first trimester.

1,"I‚Äôd just like to add I understand peoples reluctance as the covid death rates in kids are similar to the worst childhood illness (RSV, etc), though still low probability overall. I think one thing that people are missing is the long term consequences on a young child of a virus that attacks every body system. Early reports of long covid in kids estimate anywhere from 25-45% of kids who‚Äôve had covid (even mild and asymptomatic cases) have some form of long term symptom. And this is just a year and a half in. That‚Äôs the main reason I have my kid wear a mask. To protect her from the higher probability of long term health issues. 

Also I believe the main reason for mask the guidelines is to keep kids from catching and SPREADING the virus.

Plus if Harris gets 25thed into the white house between now and then, it's even worse because everybody will be coming out to stop her. That's why Biden only did the commission instead of just nominating new justices. Also Pelosi's commission isn't really moving very well. Even the social media platforms, facebook included are starting to regret propping up the democrats because now they want to come after them with regulations not to make them uphold free speech which they were afraid of under Trump, but to censor more than they can handle without hurting their bottom line.

0,"I can't say ""everybody"", though I'm sure there were such amongst them. No great humanitarians for sure. Here's a [list]( of those whom Trump pardoned. He issued clemcy to 237 individuals. There are two big things to notice in his record.The first can be summed up by the followng quote from the article linked above.

> Of the pardons and commutations that Trump did grant, the vast majority were to persons to whom Trump had a personal or political connection, or persons for whom executive clemency served a political goal.[2][3][4] A significant number had been convicted of fraud or public corruption.[5],

The second thng to note is that the USA has a government office, the Office of the Pardon Attorney, where people recommended for pardons are usually reviewed as to siutability. Only 25 of the 237 pardons went through said office."

0,"Seeing it on the news really, really doesn't qualify. If anything, that places a comfortable distance between you and those deaths. It enables dehumanization. It's one of the reasons 24 hour news media and social media are destroying our society. I've seen people die in person. Some while they were talking to me. That makes death real. It makes it something we will all deal with at some point. It's a shared experience in a weird way and it allows you to see other people as just that: People. Seeing it on a screen makes it entertainment. And that keeps all this shit going. 

So here's the choice:

One: We all realize that we've been sucked into this endless cycle of dehumanization and recrimination and we find a way to identify with each other and chart a course out of this that involves actually being able to see people we don't agree with as at least being humans worthy of decent treatment.

Two: We continue along this course. We see more violence. More dysfunction. More institutionalized psychopathy in the form of social media and in a generation or two, what started as your regularly schedule election year rioting ends up as a very short, very violent civil war. And nobody knows what happens after that. Not a lot of nuclear superpowers have endured a sectarian civil war. Should be a hoot, though.

There is no third option. We figure this out and proceed or we don't and just keep riding this wave of hatred, suspicion and degumanization until we start murdering each other wholesale."

Who has a doctor they trust and can afford to go see them, which is, sadly, not everyone. Vaccine hesitant people that could be reached may not be because of our for-profit medical industry. I wonder if there's anything that could be done for these people through outreach. 

Also sadly, the ""rational common sense"" thing isn't everyone either. Many are caught up in conspiracy theories and propaganda and would see a doctor advising them to take it as more ""evidence"" that the entire medical field was evil or corrupt. Anti-vaxxers need to be deradicalized first, then we have a shot at getting them vaccinated. But if we knew how to deradicalize en masse, we likely already would have.

1,"They identified him, or he did anyway. Gave an interview before Afghanistan,"
0,"I would recommend getting away from the theories and looking at what each party is doing right now. I like personal freedom and limited government; most people do. But I'm looking at what the Republicans are fighting for right now, and what the Democrats consider important, and I find that the Democrats win on both policy and morals.

Republicans are trying to wrest control by taking away voting rights and playing dirty. They invented a senate convention to keep Merrick Garland out of the Supreme Court in 2016, and they broke that exact convention, in a much more severe way (much closer to the election) in 2020. More than half of house Republicans voted to undermine trust in a free and fair election. These are things that should not go unpunished, so I can't in good conscience vote for a Republican today.

To address your point on limited government, here are some cases where the Democrats are fighting for limited government: Shrinking the military-industrial complex, keeping states out of abortion, ending the war on drugs, placing limits on police power, weakening state legislatures' ability to restrict voting rights and gerrymander, and stopping big pharma's abuse of patents to gouge people for life-preserving drugs. Democrats are in other instances fighting for increased regulations, but these examples are here to show it's not as black and white as Republicans = Small Government. And that's not to mention people like Abbott and DeSantis essentially mandating conservative ideology for local governments in their states.

TL;DR: Democrats have recently shown their respect for convention and interest in fighting for the majority, whereas Republicans repeatedly fight dirty for their donors and their core supporters at the expense of everyone else. For that reason, even if a Republican had a policy that I agreed with, I could not justify supporting them."
0,No one would help them. Can't have a world War with 3 countries. And they would probably end up negotiating anyway because they'd have no proxies to fight the war for them.

0,"I'm sorry, but no.

This thing doesn't have leaders. It has voices that cut through the din slightly better than their peers. This isn't a political movement or a nation state we can negotiate with or intimidate. These people simply don't trust anyone in government or media. They don't trust anyone whose message isn't aligned specifically with theirs. When these figures die, it is a literal nonissue to the people following them. 

Here's a prime example. This is a real patient I have transported multiple times. I'm not giving you his name or location or anything you can use to identify him. But this is a good look at these people's psychology if you're interested:

He and his wife are both in their early 40s. They have a 13 year old child together. Nice house, nice cars, nice jobs.... these people had a great life. But they're antimaskers and antivaxxers. So they all get sick and the Dad doesn't do so well. He ends up brain dead on a vent. One would think that this would be the shot across the bow his wife needed. It wasn't. Nobody in that family got the vaccine even after Dad ended up gorked. Nope. Not a single vaccine was given. Now, they all have it again. Dad, who is being kept at home on a ventilator, has active, symptomatic covid. Delta variant, even. 

That's not the interesting part. The interesting part is that literally every health problem Dad has is the fault of the hospitals that he was treated in. The brain death thing? Not covid. That was an inattentive nurse not maintaining the vent. Kidney failure? They gave him a kidney infection with a ""bad catheter"". Heart damage? They did a bad job with the central IV line. Literally every problem this man has is constantly dismissed as being a product of malpractice and not a well documented virus just doing the same shit to him that it does to millions of other people. You know, they won't actually say ""covid"" unless forced to. I asked his medical history and the family listed all these problems in detail..... and never once mentioned covid. Not once. 

These people are invested in this thing now. And they're invested in the worst way possible. You can walk away from money. Walking away from an online persona that everyone who knows you has been watching for over a decade? No fucking way, man. They absolutely will let their family members die. They'll let themselves die. They won't give a shit because if they die, at least they died without breaking. They fought to the absolute fucking end and never backed down once. So that's why a 13 year old boy is watching his comatose father slowly die while his mom loses her shit and screeches at everyone who comes near. 

Nothing is going to change them. Nothing is going to weaken that resolve. Some few will flake off and get vaccinated (and not tell anyone) and a few will get severely ill and claim vaccinated status to avoid ridicule because even with the insane levels of doublethink these days, even they can connect the dots there. But publicly change their minds? No fucking way. This is too entrenched. Conflict between these people and literally everyone else is just baked into their DNA. And they aren't really wrong about a lot of it. White people from Red states are the last people you can openly, publicly and acceptably hate. And it's been that way for generations. You can't expect people raised in that kind of environment to see the media or the government or even people who aren't from their communities as anything but a threat. 

We lost this thing a long time ago. We lost it when Lincoln died, really."

>She had also faced prior charges, including felony robbery, trespass, and contempt of court, stemming from an alleged violation of a domestic violence restraining order related to the same ex-boyfriend, but those charges were dropped. Prior to that incident in 2017 Jones had been arrested and charged with criminal mischief for vandalizing her former romantic partner‚Äôs SUV, but those charges were later dropped, as well.\[44\]\[45\]\[46\]\[4\]  
>  
>Jones also faced criminal charges in Louisiana in 2016, where she was arrested and charged by the LSU Police Department with one count each of battery on a police officer and remaining after forbidden and two counts of resisting arrest after refusing to vacate a Louisiana State University office upon being dismissed from her staff position."

Those are facts.

1,"I had it. 12 hours of symptoms. 

There are plenty of studies showing that surgical masks and cloth masks don‚Äôt work. In fact, even N95 aren‚Äôt so effective, because if they were, the US Army would issue them and not MOPP 4 gear. 



Virtually every study before the pandemic showed no effectiveness from masks. 



They had to get sloppy with their studies to make the case and it has a major replication crisis for studies of the last year. 

Surgical masks are used to prevent drops of saliva from dripping into the would while operating on, it has zero to do with aerosols and virus particles. It is because the surgeon is literally having his face down and right above the wound. So logically, they aren‚Äôt being used for the same reason between surgery and general public. If the virus was so deadly, why aren‚Äôt they required to be dumped in bio waste containers. 

Why if you had the virus would you get the vaccine? Studies show natural immunity is much better than the vaccine:

>**In addition, spike-specific IgG+ memory B cells persist**, which bodes well for a rapid antibody response upon virus re-exposure or vaccination. Virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are polyfunctional and maintained with an estimated half-life of 200 days. Interestingly, CD4+ T cell responses equally target several SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whereas the CD8+ **T cell responses preferentially target the nucleoprotein, highlighting the potential importance of including the nucleoprotein in future vaccines**. Taken together, these results suggest that broad and effective immunity may persist long-term in recovered COVID-19 patients.



You do realize that there are plenty of doctors who are telling patients to NOT get the vaccine. My doctor told me to not get it. Do you know more than her?

And it appears the vaccine isn‚Äôt working, it is a leaky vaccine and the worst time to give a vaccine that is leaky is during the pandemic.

Obama and the folks in Chicago remarked on the accomplishment, but the speech and tone focused on the work that lay ahead, and how it would take every single one of us working together.

Meanwhile in Arizona, McCain was extraordinarily professional and graceful in his concession, and he thanked everyone for their support. When he spoke of moving on and working with the President-elect in spite of their differences, the crowd erupted into boos. McCain never really had control of his own people after that. Once winning was out of hand, they reverted to their true nature.

And it only got worse in the 12-13 years since. I sure didn't predict this, but I felt in my soul we would face the ugly truth of what America truly is.

The way I see it is, the ""gay community"" (I use quotations because it's stupid to divid people and put them in separate categories based off stupid shit, like sexuality, and I refuse to give it validity.. gay or straight, we're still human beings and equals) has been hijacked by sexual deviants, sexual predators, pedophiles, pretenders, and people with severe mental illness.

I remember watching The Skeleton Twins and being disturbed through it. The brother (Bill Hader) is gay and had a relationship with his high school English teacher (Ty Burrell) back when he was a student. So he gets back in touch with this teacher as an adult and it's awkward and he (Hader) gets rejected or something because Burrell has gone straight or something. It doesn't matter what the fallout was because the point is that they were normalizing that behavior. They were humanizing the teacher who took advantage of the student and they painted it as if the student wanted it. That is the point of age of consent laws, minors don't fully understand the ramifications of what they are doing. They may indeed want it, that's the point, the law is there to protect them from their bad decisions. And the minor may not be traumatized by such an event, but it effects them. It's a line we shouldn't cross. It's one thing to debate which age it should be. 16? 18? 21? Each one is somewhat arbitrary. There is no magic day after which a person is truly mature. There will be those who are more mature at 16 than some who are 21... it doesn't matter. We need a hard line and to enforce that law. It protects the minors, but it also protects adults, giving them extra reason to say no if and when a minor might come on to them.

That crowd had blown through every barricade and doorway they'd come across as they pressed further into the building. If Byrd had tried to stop them with anything less than deadly force he would have quickly been overwhelmed, leaving members of congress at the mercy of a violent mob.

Unless you're of the opinion that crowds should be able to seize government officials at will, that should be a non-starter. 

I mean, just imagine if BLM demonstrators had forced their way into the Whitehouse and converged on the executive residence while Trump and his family were inside. What would you expect the secret service to do? Surrender the president? 

No. With every other viable alternative exhausted they'd use deadly force. Byrd had no viable alternative. It was justified."

1,"Fauci was well aware that specific research into bat cornovirus was taking place at the Wuhan Virology Institute. He specifically approved funding of this type of research. Yet, early in the pandemic he pushed the line that the virus spontaneously popped up in a wet market in the same frigging city where they were studying this specific thing. 

He knew, he lied, and he may very well have been the cause of the entire massive catastrophe that COVID19 and will forever be.  It's not a stretch to make this claim. 

It is entirely possible that the man who was instrumental causing the deaths of over 4.5 million people and the loss of trillions of dollars in economic activity is in fact the same man that is being celebrated as a hero by people like Trevor Noah, John Oliver and others. In fact, there appears to be solid evidence to this.

Someone needs to ask him why he pushed the story that COVID 19 developed in nature when he was very well aware that research into that specific type of very unique virus was being funded by the NIH in the city where the virus originated."

He laid down his life protecting innocent women and children fleeing from certain tyranny and death. He covered for his brothers and sisters in arms as they made their way to safety. He put himself in harms way to get the most vulnerable people out.

Doesnt change the fact that his death is sad and senseless, but he did not die in vein.

Forget the war in Afghanistan and the withdrawal. He and the others that died had no control over that. 

They served with honor and paid the ultimate price for others. Definition of hero.

0,"No doubt.

If the goal was to withdraw and avoid fighting the Taliban, I don't see how Biden had much choice. 

Even if the WH and DoD thought there was a chance that the Afghan government would collapse, if we had taken precautions with that in mind, we would have further eroded the legitimacy of the Afghan government, much like Trump did with how he negotiated with the Taliban.

And so while it was awful that the military and government collapsed, actions taken to prevent that would have made it even more likely. 

In other words, Biden was right. It was always going to fail unless we stayed there to prop it up."

When I was in high school gays were called faggots, which I never approved of. I‚Äôve always believed that being gay is not a choice. If it were a choice, many individuals would choose not to be, just to avoid the severe harassment that comes with it. Pedophiles of course are predators, and need to be sent to jail. There they can get a lesson daily on what a predator is by the inmates. Most hardened criminals hate pedophiles, and will teach them what it feels like.

Drones can keep on station for days and watch for particular people, then fire missiles. We are going to soon have autonomous robot soldiers with live ammunition. Nobody stands a chance against these things\*.

Unless there is a split and the military joins in the action, any real attempt at armed rebellion will be quickly quashed.

So, stop worrying so much. The bad guys know this just as well as the good guys. They aren't going to risk real armed rebellion. Also, there just aren't enough of them. They put on pretty shows, but the actual numbers are very small. The only thing they could pull off would be insurgency, killing civilians. If I was black and lived in Mississippi, I would move immediately to someplace like new york or california.

However, a nation reconciles these differences the way Biden is doing it. By treating the root cause, which is economic. All these so-called 'wedge issues' are excuses for anger for people who feel marginalized and can't find a good job. If we fix that problem, this anger problem melts away.

Also, tax FOX news out of existence.

I am not sure if you are asking specifically about younger people, but I think it is a fairly good chance that Amy Klobuchar will be the leader of the Senate Dems at some point, and if Warnock manages to hold his seat he will be a pretty iconic US Senator. 

As far as the Squad goes, I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if AOC left politics, or at least left elected office. She has not been especially productive in Congress (though neither has Bernie and he‚Äôs been there forever so idk), and has started to do some of the same things that she criticized her first opponent for like not holding town halls in the district. Maybe she will end up surprising me, but I‚Äôm not confident. Ilhan Omar had a substantial gap in votes between herself and Biden in 2020, so I‚Äôm curious to see how long she holds on and stays in Congress as well. Ayanna Pressley I suspect is eyeing Markey‚Äôs Senate seat whenever he decides he‚Äôs done. 

I‚Äôve always been a Pete fan and agree that he is a very likely Democratic nominee for president in the future. If people would listen to him, I think they would be pleasantly surprised by how progressive he is. He literally ran on the idea of abolishing the electoral college! Another important thing to keep in mind about Pete is that the most powerful Democrats seem to think he‚Äôs a big deal. Obama, Jimmy Carter, Joe Biden, etc. That matters (even if it really shouldn‚Äôt). Jason Kander and Conor Lamb probably fit here as well. I would love to see Kander get involved in politics again."

Democrats are enthusiastic about regulating the drug industry, yet hate it when the Republicans regulate the trade of cannabis.

Guy outside of the Library of Congress claiming to have a bomb was just that a claim.  He didn't actually have one.  Unlike those that might soon after crossing our porous southern border.  You think an insurgent is going to get the directions wrong and request a conversation?

Media saying that MAGA is the biggest threat and not the porous border that may have allowed the next insurgent force free access?  Got it.  

They schedule riots now?  Someone should tell the BLM this.

Fear mongering voters and putting policies in place.  Oh, snap.  You believe Congress is MAGA.  Damn, son.  No those are mostly elected officials.

Do you really expect the beheadings of women to take place in Texas because they obtained an abortion?  Broadcast on public access or will it be a pay per view thing you think?

These people aren't ripping our nation apart.  It's the media and the current Presidential Administration.  Oh, wait.  Forgot about Putin.  It's actually the Russians.  Dropped my MSN script.

Your failing to see the disconnect because your not seeing the forest for the trees.  Step back and look at it from a broader open border perspective.

Poverty is the biggest threat to our nation.  Poverty causes people to loot, rage and kill.  Starvation maybe added to that list if these government programs to destroy farmers crops and lifestock continues.

Remember, this is all occuring in cities that defunded their police.  That was a Democratic cry throughout the campaign and Democratic cities are suffering.   

Now, remember Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeff Epstein?  Seems once they started talking, we the people got shut out.  Claims of Congressional sexual misconduct were floating around and suddenly silence prevailed.  It became a conspiracy theory and a group called QAnon was created.

The next day, Louisiana State University made a similar demand of its students and faculty. Within about 24 hours of the FDA move, other major employers, such as Chevron and Goldman Sachs, rolled out new vaccine mandates. In a novel twist, Delta Airlines announced that it would impose a $200-a-month health-insurance surcharge on unvaccinated employees. Regardless of the reasons for their hesitancy, unvaccinated employees will literally have to pay for it.

Because lets be honest here, the only way the United States is going to get past Covid is if vaccines are mandated and Republicans can stop using bullshit arguments to score political points."

What he said was, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a nice ‚Äúnews‚Äù skirt‚Äù‚Äî  They played a clip of Dore saying, (this is not verbatim) ‚Äúi made her feel terrible, and ashamed‚Ä¶ I did that‚Äù ‚Äî then the clip stops and Cenk calls him a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù. Right after the clip cuts off, Dore finishes his comment by explaining how terrible it was that he made her feel that way, and then he apologized. 
‚Äî‚Äî with that said, I‚Äôm voting for Newsom, don‚Äôt like Elder, but I‚Äôm very curious about what he said after the clip stopped, because it was very abrupt. Elder doesn‚Äôt seem like he is advocating for paying slave owners reparations. The point he seems to be making is that it was legal to have slaves, so if reparations were paid out, an argument could be made for the slave owners receiving reparations as well. He didn‚Äôt sound like he was advocating for that, but just making a point on reparations as a whole. If I were to make a guess, he was making an argument against reparations, not making a point that slave owners should be paid as well."

Could we, should we do better? Of course. It's absurd that it's not 100% of eligible people. However, how will shutting down improve vaccine uptake? If anything, shutting down will spread things out while also selecting for more contagious variants, allowing those mutations to take hold as a larger percentage. Again, unless you have some future intervention (i.e., a vaccine), you're kicking the can down the road.

It will likely also set Republicans deeper in their ways. These people clearly need to see it firsthand to do anything about it. 

So again I ask, what exactly do you propose we do? We are already making moves towards mandating vaccines in all the environments we can. Are we then supposed to shutdown and hope Arkansas spontaneously vaccinates itself?

After the last year I'm absolutely shocked that there are still large numbers of people our there who don't acknowledge the massive human cost of shutting down the We've become completely accustomed to massive intervention with little-to-no quantitative reasoning.

That being said, it's been far easier for me as a nuclear advocate to convince a right winger to support nuclear power than to have a left winger support nuclear.

The left bludgeoned the right with emotional appeal and NIMBYism to shut down our stance on nuclear in the general public, meaning that the only options left if you knew solar and wind wouldn't do anything would be to either be silent and keep voting... Or throw your hands in the air. It's so easy to bring right wing republicans who don't believe in climate change back to believing in reasonable stances on environmentalism as long as A) it's incremental and B) you validate their concerns. Same thing I've done with most topics.

And, to be honest, if the right says don't spend money and not solve the problem, and the left says spend more money on something that won't solve the problem... I think not spending money is still a better option.

It's so irritating if you look at it and see how the the nuclear regulatory commission called a lot of the anti nuclear attacks ""leftist trash"" all the way back in the 80s. If they let us keep going we would have been like France and this wouldn't have been an issue."

If you look at a [population growth map]( you'll see that it is mainly R dominated states that are loosing population. Not only that but heavy D areas of R states are gaining population, for example in Montana:

7 counties are gaining population, 5 of them contain larger cities (for Montana): Bozeman, Billings, Missoula, Helena, and Kalispell. One of the remaining counties is just to the South of Missoula (some of the suburbs spill over) and the other is mostly a fairly populous Native American reservation. Native Americans vote heavily D in Montana.

I agree that we should help others in community but that help shouldn't come from a government robbing me to pay someone else. I'd rather use my own money and donate in charities for that.

(2500, 8-18-21‚ÄìT: 9:30 AM)
A Nation‚Äôs Civil Struggle and A Prince: ‚ÄúWe Have a Prince, a True Dedicated Son of the Nation of Iran‚Äù
One of the most effective defensive movements against the misguided, powerful dictators and authoritarians is peaceful ‚ÄúCivil Struggle‚Äù. It definitely energizes powerless people to stand up for their human rights. Dictators normally take advantage and abuse herd mentality and do not understand nor consider our designed ‚ÄúHuman World‚Äù, our ‚ÄúHuman Project‚Äù and our ‚ÄúHuman Characteristics
‚Äù. Therefore, they run our ‚ÄúManmade World‚Äù to suit their own agenda. It is evident that, they have different understandings of Man and Existence. As an example: In 1979 Iran Crisis, such dictators inhumanly supported the barbaric, anti-Iranians, anti-women, ant-civilizatio
n ‚ÄúKhomeini‚Äù in day light in front of everybody‚Äôs eyes. Sadly, compliant humanity is always sacrificed, when ignorant leaders brain wash people with their own noncompliant agenda. On the other hand, it is so difficult to awaken the victims who have defiantly been brain washed. Their sustained psychological scars prevent them to listen to reason and logic. As you see human individual life is full of juggling. But, it should never be contemplated as a game. Nevertheless, our human-progress keeps developing mysteriously. Designedly, the development of our human-progress depends on Time and our Awareness. Among human complexity and lack of awareness, ‚ÄúHuman Project‚Äù keeps developing through human individuals‚Äô intelligence and sacrifice. Our dear Shahzadeh has always been recommending the peaceful ‚ÄúCivil Struggle‚Äù against the terrorist and anti-human regime in Iran. Let‚Äôs see how the ‚ÄúCivil Struggle‚Äù works. The effectiveness of the ‚ÄúCivil Struggle‚Äù depends on two major variables. 1) Are people in Iran ready for ‚ÄúCivil Struggle‚Äù movement? 2) Are the supporters of the present regime in Iran ready to listen and learn? Determination of the two conditions is complicated and depends on awareness level of people in the entire ‚ÄúManmade World‚Äù. We do have potentials to enhance people‚Äôs awareness. We also have power to repair all the damages made by ‚ÄúKhomeini‚Äù supporters in past 42 years. But, what we do not have presently is time to waste. On the other hand, human individual life is also transitory. During last 42 years we have been neglecting and regressing human-progress and wasting human productive life. More life is going to be ruined if we remain silent and do not stand up. We know that our Prince from forefather Kourosh with understanding, experience, and compassion can serve and save Iran. Unfortunately, some political conditions and stumbling blocks are preventing Shahzadeh to go to Iran. We are certain that Shahzadeh has already realized that Time is of essence and Iran is sinking fast. Therefore, we believe that Shahzadeh knows that his attention to the following A and B ‚ÄúCivil Struggle‚Äù is essential. We also believe that Shahzadeh should aim higher than become Iran‚Äô king, rather to become an unforgettable hero in our human life forever. We believe that our Prince with his wisdom and support of Seemorgh (Phoenix, the Ancient Wisdom) can originate wiping out the anti-human virus ‚ÄúIslamic Ideology‚Äù from Iran and human body. We believe that Shahzadeh is the Hope and has the inherent insight to revive Iran‚Äôs rich culture and civilization and bring peace and harmony to Iran and the rest of our ‚ÄúManmade World‚Äù. We believe that, in name of Ferdowsi, Shahzadeh would definitely accomplish the noblest human achievements and become the shiniest Hero in human history. Without any doubt our ‚ÄúManmade World‚Äù will at least profit of the results of the following C, D, E, F, G, H, and I.
A) Conquer the hearts of defenseless simple Iranian people by acquiring the name Kourosh instead of Reza.
B) Alert and make people aware of their designed ‚ÄúHuman Rights‚Äù which have been oppressed during the outdated ‚ÄúIslamic Ideology‚Äù, by converting from Islam to Zoroastrianism (The Path of Kourosh and Zartosht).
C) Will open people‚Äôs minds and facilitate our human-progress development.
D) Will enhance people‚Äôs awareness.
E) Will enhance the quality of human life.
F) Will raise human education level which million schools have failed.
G) Will empower individuals and the Nation to become productive and creative.
H) Will provide human guidance for mentally-perple
xed powerful dictators.
I) Will hopefully drive people into the full designed human living////// of Nation‚Äôs Civil Struggle and A Prince Struggle‚Ä¶......

0,"If I had to go into Weld County or some other hotspot frequently I'd obviously wear my mask, and I would be more worried.

I wear my mask in grocery stores now and even when there was no recommendation if the staff was still wearing it, etc but it is not required anywhere except healthcare settings where I am and our community spread is very low (the lowest it has been during the pandemic).  So while I wear it in very public places, I get to enjoy a lot of unmasked activities here with very little risk to myself or others.

I am very careful, I'm sorry you are not doing well which is why I specified that I was lucky to live in a pretty solidly blue area.

&x200B;

I do have a lot of privilege, I would not be fired or not paid if I was sick and I live in an area of Colorado that is both very democratic and has a raising cost of living (mostly because home prices are skyrocketing).

Democrats voted for sick leave in the state (which might not help you), and if reconciliation passes will have federally mandated sick leave as well.  Obviously no one wants to get sick, but everyone does get sick sometimes.

I have loved ones in the hospital for non-covid reasons something that would have wracked my nerves during the pandemic, but they have such a good handle on it here and all the healthcare workers at the facilities they are at are vaccinated so I'm not worried for them and neither are they (even though they are elderly).  It is a wonderful feeling.

The fear is gone for me and my family, and I'm not going to be sorry.  I'm not spreading any disease by not engaging in public and private activities that I wouldn't have before.  I get tested, I'm vaccinated and I associate almost purely with people who are also vaccinated.  I wear my mask when appropriate, but the virus where I am is not being hit as hard as it likely is in your area.

I'm sorry for you, but I'm not sorry that I feel safer for me and my family because of the steps we took and our community took to slow the spread of the virus.  After last year I'm going to enjoy it while I can, taking all safety precautions but not because of fear for myself and the people in my family.  Vaccines work and are worth it."

Sydney however has had an out break of Covid 19 D the state there is trying to get it under control, thus no large gatherings. The protesters were told not to go, as gatherings spread Covid. They went there with the intent to break the laws. We have been fortunate in Australia to avoid deaths from Covid and are proud to say only a few deaths not 1000s of deaths that followed uncontrolled riots like the US. Perhaps the way fwd would be to tell protesters they are banned from wearing masks then they would protest that by wearing a mask."

0,If you are going to ‚Äútake a knee‚Äù on the vaccine stay home if you get sick.
0,"When we shut down in March, it was because we didn't know what was going on and needed to hit the emergency brake. When we applied COVID measures after in 2020 and beyond, it was to buy us time to get to a vaccine. Every time we shut down it was because something would change in the future.

Now I ask, what will change in the future? What is the point of applying COVID precautions that come with their own mortality risks in the form of socioeconomic decline, missed education, and rising wealth inequality?

People will say to keep the hospitals from drowning in patients, but at 0% vaccination and the areas doing nothing all of 2020, the doomsday scenarios never materialized. Busy hospitals, yes, but not a catastrophic collapse. Now we've got a vaccine that more than half the population has taken, disproportionately by the elderly. I just don't see the hospitals collapsing. Getting very busy? Yes, but that happens every year.

So there seems to be little chance of true given the vaccines are preventing hospitalization and death and mitigating disease in many ways. We have a vaccine that is wildly effective and protects nearly everyone who takes it. Why *not* let people make that decision for themselves? Fuck it. I'm vaccinated and I won't die of COVID. Others have chosen not to be, and I'm not sure I want to hamstring my life again for their sake when they clearly don't care."

Most outlets that reaches our circle Amnesty International, CNN, NYTimes, BBC, & The Telegraph has reported one sided stories that coverup or sympathize with the TPLF (the aggressor) by appealing to their ethnic base despite them even targeting their own who disagree.

Let me just give you a glimpse to what I'm referring to:

* NYTimes + Senator Coons makeup stories to blame the Ethiopian PM as cause.
   * [
* The Telegraph jumping through hoops to blame Ethiopians of Genocide.
   * [

There is so so so much more - if you know an Ethiopian talk to them and they'll tell you. At the moment MSM isn't reporting the facts (at best cherry picking & downplaying). I'll be doing my best to TLDR the series of events - I'm just one dude trying to clear the misinformation.

Seriously talk to an Ethiopian. Ask them about news coverage. Ask them about the Democratic Party & Biden. If what I say is a lie you'll see it reflected in their words.

However even if their using the country of origins laws you would still have to wonder why Denmark has a low rape count? Do they have extremely strict laws or are they hiding their cases from us? Does Denmark stack up in comparison to other western countries(where the laws would be somewhat similar, obviously there would be some differences between them all) and would that show us something vastly different in comparison?

Also, if you were to look at the stat through a different lens like ""ohh well Denmark is just more civil"" or something of the sort then suddenly this has a vastly different meaning to what is presented as truth.

When Trump was saying let's make friends with Russia, I began to think that Trump really wants to free America from the control of the Deep State because making any deals with Russia is what the Deep State doesn't want, be they Neocons or Democrats. Trump acted like Democrats were preventing him from making friends with or even talking to Putin or having a negotiation, meanwhile he imposed sanctions after sanctions against Russia. Then, at the end of Trump's term, he truly waged a massive anti-China information campaign, similar to the one Reagan waged against the USSR. What this tells me is that Trump wanted to fool everyone that he is a nice guy who wants to make friends with Russia and others. This tells me that he is still down with the people who are interested in regime changes in Russia and China and are not interested in negotiations, which means that Trump isn't any better than Bush, Obama, Clinton, etc. He almost fooled me. I thought that Trump was against the DS, but he was with the Neocons. If he wasn't with the Neocons, then he was surrounded by them, which means that he just couldn't really do anything from the get go and he wasn't in control of anything.

Do you think the Taliban gives a fuck if the world considers them legitimized? Does that someone remove power from them if they're not? They're the de facto rulers of Afghanistan regardless of what Trump has done. This sort of narrative as a means to attack Trump is so worthless. Democrats did the same shit with North Korea as if to imply that the Kim regime wouldn't be in charge if Trump didn't meet with them. Diplomacy means you speak to whoever is in charge, even they're the bad guys. Don't fault Trump because Democrats are too weak to try and solve things that required speaking with the enemy. No peace treaty would've ever been come to if we were to abide by your mindset.

Do you actually care or are you just using it to negate the last 13 lives lost?

>I am sorry for the 13 soldiers but many more American lives(and dollars) will be saved by Biden ending the war.

He could've encouraged Obama to end it during the full eight years they were already in office, then. All it took for Biden to end the war is for Trump to have planned everything out and for Biden to just allow it to actually happen."

Hey, remember when Fauci told everyone not to wear masks for COVID?

...and then later he told us he'd lied to us to manipulate us, because he didn't want people buying up all the masks?

Remember when he lied about the percentage of the population that would have to be vaccinated in order to attain herd immunity?

...and then later admitted he'd lied in order to get more people to get vaccinated?

What other lies have they told us, and not admitted to yet?

Why is the government pushing so hard to get people to take a barely-tested vaccine, that the creator of the technology has said people shouldn't take, for a disease that kills 0.5% of those it infects (concentrated among the elderly who have multiple other health conditions)?  ...especially when we now know that there are animal reservoirs for the disease so it will never go away, and we know that the vaccine is a ""leaky"" vaccine, so fully vaccinated people can not only still be infected and transmit the virus, but they carry viral loads as high or higher than unvaccinated people?

Why are we insisting people be vaccinated when the disease is so contagious that most people have already had it (and never knew it because the symptoms were so mild), and natural immunity after having had the disease is far more effective (and lasts longer) than the vaccine?"

1,"The declaration of independence was a document explaining why British citizens were overthrowing their government and included specific examples of abuses by the king to justify why they were doing it to gather support from other British subjects living in the colonies and other European powers.

The Constitution was created to create a new constitutional republic to replace a failing confederacy of states. It includes a blue print for how this government should operate and how it can be changed through constitutional amendments. All states ratified this through a vote making it the new law of the land.

The bill of rights were added later through the amendment process established in the constitution because it was the law of the land. 

There is no, we declared independence so you can legally do it whenever you want clause.

But I get that this is still up for debate, the fact that there is no consensus leads me to believe that the only ethical choice is to assume that it begins at the beginning. If I'm wrong, and life starts later then that's a goalpost that could be moved, the only known consequence is that a few more people were born that otherwise would not have been. But if it turned out that life does start in the womb, and I was an advocate for abortion, then I would have also been an advocate for murder.
I think the fact that you feel that the unborn carry the same value as a tumor up to the point of birth is a pretty solid indicator that there won't be much of anything we can agree on regarding this matter.

You mentioned enforcing a POV on people who do not think the same way. Generally, I'm inclined to agree with your sentiments. But this isn't something like insisting everyone worship my god, or wear specific clothing, or mandating some other inane subject that conforms your life to mine. To your average conservative, it's about preventing the murder of those who cannot advocate for themselves. I know we disagree on when life begins and probably even on whether or not that actually matters, but I would like to think that maybe if you saw it from a different perspective you would understand why there's so much passion from the right on this issue."

The War on Terror, also known as the Global War on Terrorism and U.S. War on Terror, is an ongoing international military campaign launched by the United States government following the September 11 attacks. The targets of the campaign are primarily Islamist groups located throughout the world, with the most prominent groups being Al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, the Taliban, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, and the various franchise groups of the former two organizations. The naming of the campaign uses a metaphor of war to refer to a variety of actions that do not constitute a specific war as traditionally defined.

0,"I had the same question. On Twitter, Neil says that he derived it from the following two numbers:

* According to the CDC, about 1000 unvaccinated persons die of Covid per day.
* According to unnamed polls, about 25% of Republican voters are unvaccinated while 5% of Democratic voters are unvaccinated.

Assume that there are the same number of Republican voters as Democratic voters and that everyone is a Republican voter or Democratic voter. (Of course, that's not true, but it's probably a reasonable approximation.) Then 25 / (25 + 3) = 83.3% of unvaccinated persons are Republican voters.

Assume that the percentage of Republican voters among unvaccinated deaths is the same as the percentage of Republican voters among unvaccinated persons. (Seems pretty reasonable: the virus doesn't know about political affiliation, but maybe there's some hidden correlation that makes unvaccinated Republicans more or less likely to die from Covid than unvaccinated Democrats.) Then the number of unvaccinated Republican voters dying from Covid is about 1000 \* 83.3% = 833 persons per day. Multiply by 10 and round down to obtain Neil's number."

You cannot fail to save with malice aforethought and despite taking every reasonable action still murder the person. That's just nonsense because the malice aforethought part is contradictory to the actions trying to save another. Doctors aren't perfect and fail to save people all the time and it's not murder. So why would it be any different for the unborn child that you suggest abortion be legal so that they can be killed? It doesn't make sense. Either the child is going to die regardless what you do and you can save the mother, or the child lives and the mother lives.

So no, the law doesn't need to make any exceptions for this. If you murder the child, you should be punished. Period."

At CPAC they were [celebrating Biden missing a vax goal]( and as the excuses for not getting the vaccination have gotten more and more abstract, it really just seems like for most people, it's either about scoring a political win against the administration or, more basically, just refusing to do anything a Democrat would like them to do. 

The whole group is just betting on the idea that if they are among the people who don't get covid, or who get it and don't die, that they can play the whole thing off like it was an overreaction in the first place, and therefore it's Biden's fault the economy isn't better or their kids' school can't stay open. They think about everything (even stuff like vaccines or the climate) in terms, so they feel like if they can somehow ""win"" this political fight, then the virus won't be as bad or something. The problem, of course, is that that's not how it works. You can't stop a virus from replicating, even if you convince everyone it's no big deal. 

The flipside of this strategy is that it's another concession of the center-right part of the party.

>Ultimately it comes down to this. You either believe the unborn are not people, in which case you can do anything you want to it. Or you believe that the unborn are people, in which case you can do nothing to it. I happen to fall on the latter side of that, so I find it highly unethical for society to encourage, engage in, or allow abortions barring certain extenuating circumstances.

I get that you think life begins at conception, and while I think that is not grounded in science in any way, I'm not trying to make you change your mind, despite what you may think. However, it's one thing to think or believe something, and quite another to force that on people that do not believe the same as you. No one is making people have abortions, but people are making other people carry a tumor for 9 months because the end result of that tumor is another person.

The GDP per capita of Detroit is $52,900, and the GDP per capita of Michigan is $47,500. The folks in Detroit work significantly harder and produce much more than their fellow residents. The GDP of Detroit is $237 billion while the GDP Michigan is $537 billion. A city of 675k residents produces 44% of the total GDP in a state of almost 10 million. WTF are the other 9 million Michigan residents doing???? Obviously spending all their time on Q and trying to kidnap democratically elected governors doesn't leave much time for working. 

&x200B;

But hey, how mighty white of you to go bashing them. And if the **kc** in your name refers to Missouri, that state has a GDP per capita of $47,400 -- quite a bit less than the hardworking progressives in Detroit.

0,"Sorry I‚Äôm not talking about military parents, I‚Äôm referring to the national child credit that goes to every child 18 and younger that Biden implemented at the beginning of his presidency. This is a separate issue than Biden and Congress passing a budget that spends billions of tanks and war while a fraction of that on the US. Can this change? Yes. Has it ever happened before? No.

As for sources:  Congress has passed 36 bills under Biden. We‚Äôve got bills changing post offices, bills increasing veteran and police funding, a bill to redefine the jurisdictions of Eastern North Carolina, and then Juneteenth Holiday and the Asians Hate Crime bill (which again increases funding for police.) since March. While none of these are inherently bad, certainly none of them are huge wins when compared to, say, the destruction in Afghanistan or the giant emissions coming from the military. Almost $700billion this year for ‚ÄòDefense‚Äô spending while the entire infrastructure bill isn‚Äôt even twice that when it‚Äôs supposed to be for 10 years.  Also source for US military pollution 

I mean if you think the US changing the name of a Minnesota Post Office is a huge win you do you. But every passed law since the stimulus has failed to give wins to the public, while the budget gives billions more to the military than, say, making sure everyone has healthcare and doesn‚Äôt die from COVID."

So what are you suggesting? The US government should have  told everyone a couple of months ago that you need to leave, because we don't think the Afghan government can stand on its own? That would be a terrible thing to do."

Reports I saw indicate that many in government and their military did bravely fight back.

What they were up against is an insurrection as can be expected of Donald Trump. All who want to march into the capital had until at least May to come get their free gun and be trained how. Without his muddling the Taliban would have remained destined to be a relatively small group on the run, from the Afghan army and their allies providing backup support when necessary.

By the time it was Joe Biden's problem it was already too late to prevent an eruption of organized chaos. But like on that does not mean we have to give Trump's insurrectionists control of the White House, just so none get hurt."

The only way to win at that time was to shift right (but not as far as the GOP) or keep losing elections. That‚Äôs how American political parties operate.

To explore,  Reenginer and conquer mountain that could doom mankind.. To accomplish respect from our great minds to be slandered and disrespected by Trump,  Jordan and board fools.. This and be treated with no respect by a blow hard criminal gaslighting fool like Trump.  , Then stay devoted to your country to listen to a guy who recommended bleach and tide pods to try to out do you.

Democrats want to force everyones' children to be social justice warriors for leftist causes at the expense of a basic education, that hate traditional values, hate the Constitution, and are ignorant of civics.

I would go so far as to argue it is intentionally misconstrued so we cannot defend ourselves from our country, and instead, use it as a way to enforce government oppression.

But we don't even need to remove it from the constitution. Even Scalia wrote that we have every right to restrict personal gun use. Just that the constitution is not written in such a way as to ban it by default.

0,"The problem is Pakistan.

They have several problems that the Taliban being in power mitigates:

* The majority of Pashtun people live in Pakistan, but they're a minority in Pakistan.  They are, however, at least a plurality in Afghanistan.  By giving Pashtun nationalists free reign in a neighboring country and setting that country up to fail, they weaken calls for Pashtun separatism.
* Pakistan is surrounded by enemies with stronger national identities and stronger economies.  Yes, even Iran's economy is stronger than Pakistan's--their per capita GDP is 45% higher than Pakistan's (though Iran would have difficulty invading Pakistan due to the terrain and their lower population).  By having a weak, subordinate state to their north, they're hoping to be able to focus more of their defenses along their border with India.
* Pakistan's poor economy means that they needed foreign capital, but it's not like they produce that much that foreigners want to buy.  They're not India, with well-developed Internet infrastructure and schools that churn out relatively high wage coders and managers.  They don't have a strong extraction, industrial, or service economy.  In fact, their core economic activity is *still* farming, and a plurality of their workers are agricultural workers.  Their primary exports are low value clothing items.  As a result, they spent the last 20 years playing the Americans off the Taliban for anti-terrorism funding from the Americans.  They needed the Taliban to be the bad guy so that we'd keep giving them money for nothing (and their chicks for free).
* Pakistan has poor international market access.  They have very little coastline, very few sea ports, and of the four countries they border, they have openly hostile relations with two of them.  They need *a* market for their goods.  A state with friendly warlords gives them that.

For as long as Pakistan remains embroiled in a cold war with India and isn't exporting high value goods or resources, they need the Taliban.  The Taliban provides them with a market for their goods, a buffer state to reduce the amount of border they have to defend, and a potential foil that they can use to get defensive aid from the international community.  

As a result, this *was* unavoidable.  There's no better Afghanistan without fixing Pakistan's problems.  And the reality is that their cold war situation is *popular*.  People there legitimately see India as a very real and existential threat, and it's not like they're going to make nice with the Iranians any time soon."

states had a statewide program and  more than 350 localities across 44 states have enacted and developed ‚Äúfree college‚Äù
policies‚Äîgenerally known as college promise programs 

The Tennessee Promise Scholarship requires high school seniors to apply for it, Complete the FAFSA and do 24 hours of community service (8 hours per semester) to receive free 2 year education

* As a last-dollar scholarship, Tennessee Promise funds the remaining balance of tuition and mandatory fees after all other gift aid has been applied. The amount of the Tennessee Promise award is based on the other gift aid a student receives.

308,000 High School Students have applied for the Program in the 5 years its been around, but just 28.8% have followed through to receive funding

* 60,000 didnt complete a FAFSA Form by graduation
* Of those that completed the Fafsa, Only 41% completed the community Service

Tennessee Promise has enrolled over 88,000 students since its inception in 2015. In that time, it
has helped Tennessee students cover over $115 million in college costs.

------
In 2015 57,696 students applied for the Program	

* 16,207 completed the Community Service and all required documentation to receive funding and enrollment
* 7,781 have dropped out of the Program and Community College
* 3,302 Graduated Community College paid for by the state to enrolled in a Tennessee University

------
From 1999 through 2019 Kentucky Lottery proceeds paid for 2,337,400 for total awards of $3,368,299,981 

So...yea there is free college already for most students, People just dont want to go to community college or do the work for a free education

------
In school year 2017‚Äì18, the national adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR) for public high school students was 85 percent, the highest it has been since the rate was first measured in 2010‚Äì11.

100 Students in high School

* 85 Graduate High School

* 55 Go to College

* 33 Graduate College

* 23 Graduate College and 3 College Dropouts with Student Debt

* of those 5 hold most of the Student Loan Debt

* 3 went in to medical or Professional Post Doctorate school

> Men with bachelor's degrees earn approximately $900,000 more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates. Women with bachelor's degrees earn $630,000 more. Men with graduate degrees earn $1.5 million more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates. Women with graduate degrees earn $1.1 million more.

* Lamborini, Christopher R., ChangHwan Kim, and Arthur Sakamoto. 2015. ‚ÄúEducation and Lifetime Earnings in the United States.‚Äù Demography 52: 1383‚Äì1407.

Add on to that already $700,000 in excess earnings a Tax Bail out of $10,000-$100,000

Talk about a Bailout for the 1% not the general public

-----
Meanwhile 4 out of 5 Americans will be married at least once in their life 

The average wedding cost $26,720 in 2016 according to the Wedding Report

When I was stationed in Italy we renovated a Hangar there. The Italians had to come in and inspect the progress because if and when we leave it would be turned over to them. Afghanistan, was just a drain because we were paying for everything.

People also don‚Äôt understand the wear and tear on equipment over there. There‚Äôs no permanently assigned fighter aircraft there. Everything comes from deploying units. A normal sortie time is about 1.1 hrs at home station. In Afghanistan they‚Äôre up for hours, some jets coming from Diego Garcia or UAE so they‚Äôre out of harms way. That‚Äôs cost per flying hour and tons more scheduled maintenance. Not to mention the cost to constantly move troops and support equipment in and out.

We‚Äôll still have a presence in UAE, Diego Garcia, and Guam after this. Staying in a place where our guys are constantly mortared isn‚Äôt worth it just to have a presence.

The Trump administration set the Afghanistan debacle in motion, we all know this.

They knew it was going to happen.   Trump is a moron but some of the people around him obviously were not.

Forcing refugees and asylum seekers to stay in Mexico during the Trump administration so that large numbers amass across the border and all processing of asylum requests was ground to a halt so that when Trump leaves office they start migrating in huge numbers to create an immigration crisis. It was planned this way.

The Texas abortion ban is a heinous, disgusting law and blatantly unconstitutional.  But it was intelligently crafted and carried out with precision.  And there was orchestration between lawmakers and the courts.  The appeals court cancelled a hearing suddenly without explanation and the Supreme Court refused to block the law from taking effect because of a standing issue which the law intentionally creates.  Instead of blocking the law until they heard the case (which is standard protocol), they chose to create chaos."

The autopsy on Afghanistan was started the day we directed our resources at Iraq rather than Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Taliban.  We could have trained Afghans for forty years and the Taliban would still have taken over the country in no time.

Afghanistan is a creation of the British and the local tribal elite of the country under colonialism.  The disdain for the Afghan upper classes by the lower classes within those borders imagined up by the British has been exploited by extremist Islamic clerics for 100 years.  This wasn't something that just happened with the USSR's failure there or the US's attempt at training an army who didn't see women's rights as a patriotic cause to defend the construct the British gave their elite.

The Afghan region is first and foremost tribal, secondly religious.  We refused to accept what the British and Russians learned before us.  The next phase will be a civil war within the ranks of the Taliban that balkanizes the old map and it will be one  Moscow and Beijing cannot ignore.

It has to do with it being necessary to point out that as an attack on Trump - which was how it was intended - it is a poor one.

That said, they weren't ""cages"", but the holding facilities were necessitated by Democrats refusing to secure the border or deport the illegals already here.  When you have a million people a year (probably 2 million this year) crossing your border illegally, you have to put them somewhere if you aren't going to immediately deport them.

Legally, we *could* immediately deport them - but because the Democrats will not allow that, we have to hold them for trial.  ...except the Democrats will not allow that either (beyond 20 days), so they get held in temporary facilities until they can be placed somewhere.

Because they're often alone, or with traffickers rather than their actual parents, that adds a level of complexity - especially when the traffickers claim to be their parents.  Sex trafficking of illegals and illegal alien children is quite common.

What **should** happen is they should be immediately deported, which would solve the whole problem."

And white privilege  might exist, but the overly simplified heuristic that is used when discussing white privilege deeply flawed. One can't assume that just because  someone is white, they are automatically  privileged. There are so many many variables involved that may increase, decrease, or nullify any actual  privilege that just talking about it in such broad terms of all white people compared to all minorities as privileged or oppressed is completely useless and ultimately causes more conflict than help resolve anything."

However, while its rare for cabinet secretaries who've never held national or statewide office to get to the Presidency, Buttigieg looks like he's doing an excellent job building up his Washington relationships. He keeps doing that, he'll be a strong contender in 2024 if Biden doesn't run for reelection and will almost certainly be the frontrunner for 2028.

  
Another strong contender is Andy Beshear, the current Governor of Kentucky. He doesn't have Buttigieg's DC connections but he does have governing experience and in a deep red state. A big part of this will be whether Beshear can get reelected in 2023 or not. If he can, he'll almost certainly be a contender for the Presidency in 2028.

  
Conor Lamb and Katie Porter are probably the two House Democrats with the future national prospects. I think both will likely need to build up their political careers preferably with Senate or Gubernatorial experience but both of them are probably our strongest options for winning over swing voters and competing in purple states (both a must for the White House).

The GOP literally lied about the tax cut helping middle class people get more money back in their pockets. Meanwhile, the debt exploded and people who were already insanely wealthy got more freaking money."

0,"You are right about everything you said except ""Taliban militants were almost gone."" They were growing steadily for decades.

How long do you want us to waste our time there? 20 years was way more than enough. We got Bin Laden and we eliminated Al Qaeda a decade ago. 20 years and trillions spent and the Taliban took over the country basically overnight. How much more time should we have spent there? We could've been there another year.. 5 years.. hell, we could've been there until 2133. Biden already pushed the deadline from May to September. How much longer? Should we just be there forever? The fact the Afghan government fell to the Taliban so incredibly easily is all the proof you need that us being there makes 0 difference and was a complete waste of time. It just shows that no matter how we did it, no matter when we did it, no matter who did it, the result of our withdrawal was going to be the same. It's horrible what's going on there and my heart goes out to the Afghan people (and my friend, especially, who is having a seriously rough time dealing with this). I just think it's disingenuous to blame the Afghan people and it's completely ridiculous to blame Biden.

My one criticism is that we should've evacuated more people while we still could but reports are saying that the Afghan government didn't want to evacuate people en masse, to avoid a panic. Hindsight 2021, I guess.

Even with the extreme media backlash, both parties attacking him relentlessly, left and right attacking him relentlessly, the military industrial complex in full propaganda mode, Biden is sticking to his decision and I agree 100% with everything he's said and support him 100% on this. It's the best thing he's ever done, period.

With the money we spent on this war, we could've given free K to Phd education to every American and every Afghan with a trillion to spare. Let's focus on making the world a better place now and stop nitpicking after the fact."

0,"I had an idea that seems doable. It started by trying to think of a political action based way of finding out what exactly is being taught in schools, which ends up being a grilling of curriculum that can be a chore for schools to supply all details of. Then I went in reverse, so it's instead a useful and easy scientific method based questionnaire. 

A list of schools that are either receiving or qualify to receive these vouchers, would be required. Florida taxpayers already have the right to know these things. Then send each school a questionnaire with a dozen or so quick science questions that will sum up how much they do teach. There would be no mention of Critical Race Theory or questions about what they teach in history class, but the currently first of the questions would still (through the power of science) provide some insight into their overall integrity.

It would be peer reviewed enough to make this a solid ""what scientists say"" where all else is likely science fraud where there is no scientific theory to teach just pretenders who just bully others. Like in a court of law the defendant must speak for themselves, not be kept hidden so that their political enemies who have no testable theory at all of their own can speak for them.

It's possible for religious oriented schools to do well in explaining basic concepts. Where they are that precise in how the ""theory of intelligent design"" stands in regards to what theories must explain (or else have only a premise for a theory not theory to explain how ""intelligent cause"" works).

I have an elephant in the room with educational topics galore, so if that's the ""intelligence"" related framework schools are OK with then I have to be honored by their scoring by at least their planning it into future lessons. Public schools could likewise make that how they settle that controversy, but teaching nothing at all can to some at be seen as a good thing and for that reason I'll be OK with that option too. There is something in the way science works that makes it possible to go that far, without going out of bounds of science. In the way the question would be precisely worded they can get the simple logic that keeps them safe with respectable scientists. Writing a question to account for that exception seems fair to include so the questionnaire is not biased against by not. It just happens to be one of the things I'm most passionate about in regards to getting the simple logic of how science works exactly right or end up endlessly fighting over almost nothing.

For now I'll start with the most basic questions of them all, easy to preliminarily word. One to account for ID can take at least hours or days for an acceptable preliminary question. At this point I'm going over why I should, or should not, include something that would likely be a surprise to not get penalized for teaching its status as a scientific theory like I have long been practicing, in evolution related forums. In this case it would have to first be presented in what may be the toughest scientific arena on the internet for such a thing so that you can trust that it's not an issue, where it is most likely to otherwise be.

In any case as long as schools are delighted to respond back, those who teach none of that would rightfully have the ""what are they hiding?"" question working against them, even though it's possible to have been lost while going from one person to another not intentionally left unanswered. 

\-----------------------------

*This questionnaire was made to be a fast and useful way for you to provide an idea of what your science curriculum covers, and is intended to make it easy for a school that is doing right by scientists and the scientific method to right away make you look good, without having to supply exact lesson plans and schedules to be searched for faults. Each question is worded to be specific enough to hopefully be a teacher's helper in regards to what exactly is most important to teach, out of thousands of things that you could possibly teach to add detail to these core basics.*

*If any of these questions led to being added to upcoming lessons then for due credit please indicate ""plan"" and grade level instead of leaving blank or writing ""none"". Filling learning gaps right after finding them is an indicator of scientific integrity. At least one of the questions is not normally in K-12 education recognized as necessary for a fully functional understanding of science, no penalty for indicating one or more was just filled. Unlike politics the scientific method expects adaptations to new knowledge, the following questions and possible answers make it so it's not like a political grilling you dread.*

&x200B;

At what grade level(s) is the evidence for Out of Africa Theory explained in a way that students know why it is beyond reasonable doubt true?

At what grade level(s) is the evidence for common descent (i.e. fossil, Darwinian evolution by natural selection genetic theory) explained in a way that students know why common descent is beyond reasonable doubt true?

At what grade level(s) is it explained why witnessable though fossil and genetic evidence beyond reasonable doubt concludes that ""evolution"" is a ""fact""?

At what grade level(s) do students learn that theories explain how something works. including how the witnessable through fossil and genetic evidence ""process of evolution"" works?

At what grade level(s) is the evidence for evolution theory explained in a way that introduces basic concepts of chemistry such as in [Nature - How Did Life Begin?](

At what grade level(s) is the (Albert Einstein spent time developing) model for at least a few minutes (no test required) mentioned in a way that students know why Big Bang Theory does not necessarily conclude that something came from nothing?"

0,"The biggest threat to America is what Communist 'active measures' did to America's values. The Yuri Bezmenov interview explains best: 

From Europe, that process where incrementally a people slide towards socialist thinking and opposes freedom what we Europeans have long lost is a site for sore eyes. We do not have free speech, well we do if you do not test it's limitations, and we do not have the right to bear arms, although we have great weapons factories, just not for the citizens. The citizen is at the mercy of thieves and carjackers in breaking and entering cases. Good luck, the police will arrive and help you pick up the pieces until the end of the shift.

 Our wages are directly taxed monthly, in fear of we not paying the due amount, which is very high, over 55% on high incomes, and taxation levels are not following indexation, which means wage indexation can get you in a higher tax bracket. But we do have healthcare, which is on a high standard. We usually do not have a choice for alternative medicine. Those fees are paid in full. And our college tuition is fair, but if you speak up, your name is in the papers and the SJW dean kicks your subsidized ass out.

If you start your business and become 'indepentent', you sometimes do not enjoy the social safety net employees enjoy, but your stil pay those taxes nonetheless, the cost of being an entrepreneur. If you are unemployed, you will get a monthly allowance, but you will need to have proof of your job search intentions. 

We do have multiple parties. Good luck with voting for a nationalist party. If that party gets a good result, so-called liberal and socialist and green parties, who sometimes lost the election will form a government together, so the losing parties can end up governing you anyway. Great to have voting rights. Well, ""if voting worked, it would be illegal"", as the late Alan Watt said."

The Northern Alliance is already re-forming to lead a resistance to the Taliban.

It's not that they didn't want to learn to defend their country - they were abandoned by their teachers, without the things that it was known they needed to continue fighting.

1,"So that‚Äôs a pretty broad brush statement.  I‚Äôm looking for examples from your perspective , but both parties are very, very guilty of this from a wide scope view.  And it‚Äôs really unfortunate to watch.  Kind of a slow motion car wreck.  

Socialism and communism are very different things that have gotten badly overlaid and misunderstood thanks to the media in large part and our own education system not informing people about what they actually are. 

One of the big aspects of socialism is government spending for the common and collective good.  To no small degree we are a socialist country.  I can‚Äôt think of an advanced and democratic country that isn‚Äôt.  Road building, public hospitals and schools (both could be a lot better), environmental cleanups and regulation.   This is all improving the lives of everyone living here to some degree or another.   Medicare and social security for the elderly are other examples‚Ä¶ needs work, but the concept is sound and drives down the cost of an aging population when you look at the total cost balance of getting old, a process that really sucks!  Prevention of problems is a great thing and has a clear cost benefit. Textbook basic socialism doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt be rich.  It does mean poverty and severe want shouldn‚Äôt exist in a wealthy country. That makes sense to me.   Finland is a fantastic example of this on a small scale (about the size of 1 state in the USA).   Yes, handouts are not the way, but neither are kids who are hungry (which I‚Äôve run across to damn often)

Communism, if it was ever actually implemented on a large state level, tries to make everyone essentially ‚Äúequal‚Äù.  The ‚Äúperfect‚Äù view is everyone owns everything.  The Soviet Union was theoretically a communist country.   But is was actually an oligarchal dictatorship with some people being far more equal than the vast majority of other people (to put it lightly).   

The thing I worry about from both parties is the tendency toward dictatorship coupled with the willful twisting of the rules government operates by and the equally willful ignoring of the actual interests of the people they represent.   All while drumming up fear in the constituency with lies and illusions.  Too much fire and brimstone politics.   Not enough attention to the countries real needs.   I don‚Äôt know anyone over 65 who isn‚Äôt a basic fan of Medicare and social security and paid into those systems most of their lives, at least partially earning the payback.  Improve them?   Oh yes.  Drop them.  Oh no.  The power grid in Texas is another example.   The repeated and now routine flooding of Miami.  The list goes on but we talk about distractions and petty things.   

Sorry.  This got into a bit of a ramble.  

Thx"

From what I've seen, socially, they don't differ much.  Both wings support awareness, inclusivity, and sensitivity when it comes to race, gender, and sexual orientation, at least on the surface.

It's economically that they widely differ.  Progressives are all about better pay for lower level workers and having the corporations and executives pay more in taxes.

Neoliberals, however, were a wing that gained prevalence from the Reagan era and were strengthened in the Clinton era.  As such, they are more conservative when it comes to their policies.  They support Supply-Side Economics, a Reagan policy.  Thusly they tend to indulge corporations with lobbying and backroom deals.

Presently it's the Neoliberals that have a lockdown in the party.  And that looks to not diminish in the near future.  Historically speaking though, in the long term, society always goes more liberal.  As such the Progressives could gain more of a foothold in the next decade or so.

Ideally, you'll want a Neoliberal who's slightly more to the left than most others.  Someone that can appeal to both camps within the party.

Buttigieg MAYBE COULD do this.  He's among the younger politicians, the fact he's openly gay can draw some more Progressive voters.  But he's been shown to compromise on the more left policies, which could turn off said Progressive voters.

AOC has much energy and enthusiasm with a down to earth beginning as a bartender.  But her policies may turn off the moderates and Neoliberals within the party.

This right here is why the Democrats lost in 2016. The majority of the country is pushing left, and for whatever awful reason you think it's a good idea to stay center-right, and court Republican voters that will never vote for a Democrat in a million years. These ideas aren't radical, they're just modern ideas that most every other developed nation has already implemented. A modern socialized healthcare system, structural and massive police reform, a green new deal that shifts our infrastructure to green jobs and boosts the economy. The planet is literally on fire due to climate change, the Republican party has been taken over by literal fascists, and you're here complaining about how Democrats aren't conservative enough, Jesus fucking Christ."

I would assume it extends variably to the rest of the country, but only speaking for my area, the major problem seems to be key industries not recovering fully hold back others. The biggest one I hear from prospects  is childcare. Many childcare facilities that existed pre-covid don't exist now. And the ones that do charge significantly more than they did before, because supply is low and demand is high, so they can easily. Everyone knows childcare is expensive, but when it goes up 30 or 50 or 100% or more over a year, many of the people who were working just dont make sense anymore unless they get a raise or a different job, and thats IF you can find one that can and will take your money. Theres waiting lists everywhere for childcare.

There's been a return somewhat to having a stay at home mom or dad in many families because working where they worked before is now negative money. Our economy has been used to having more adults in the labor force, as opposed to a single household earner. A return to that in any significant percentage easily continues the trend we are in now.

White privilege is the truth that, if one of those people were black, their life would be harder and they would have to deal with more issues than they do currently.

1,"If you took 200 billion from Bezos and just handed it out to all US citizens, it would be about $600 per person, one-time.  It wouldn't change anything drastically.  The scale of government spending is so far beyond the ultra wealthy it's obscene.  My point is the ultra wealthy are not the problem or the solution.  They're an inevitable result of a global economy in my view.  They aren't necessarily evil or good, but one thing that's pretty universal is that they have changed the world on a global scale.

The exception to the above being when special interests and lobbyists are pushing policy not in our best interest with billionaire dollars driving policy.  We used to call that corruption or at least a conflict of interest or ethics violation.

I have no idea how to fix it, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, so hold my beer:

1) Remove the power and money from DC by drastically decreasing federal spending and returning power to the states.  I'm thinking decentralization of this power makes it harder to corrupt and more accountable to the people.

2) Cryptocurrency may be a game changer.  I'm sure with its own set of unforseen consequences.


I don't know what the numbers are currently, but Biden was proposing something like 10 trillion in spending over the coming years.  For my household, of which, I'm the only income earner, if we naively just divide 10 trillion by 330 million citizens, then multiple by the number in my household, that's about 150,000 the government is spending of my earnings, on my behalf.  The reality is worse, because the bottom 50% aren't effectively paying federal income tax (though of course they pay other taxes).  I'm sorry, I have better things to spend on than supporting bloated, inefficient government.  That's only proposed new federal spending, I already pay property tax, sales tax, gas tax (presumably for 'infrastructure'), local income tax, state income tax, medicare, social security, and the corporate taxes, etc built into the good we buy.

All things considered, the bureaucrats are probably really close to controlling more of the wealth we produce than we are.  I am not against all taxes, but the way I see it the bureaucracy in DC is effectively a parasite which is bleeding us dry with debt and wasteful spending.  I don't know where all that money goes, but I'm certain obscene amounts are being wasted or even being spent on causes directly opposed to the interests of the citizens paying for this mess."

1,"I am from a Suburb in Sydney, NSW. Every morning at 11am all the MSM televise our Premier, Gladys Berajiglian ranting and raving about this Delta virus and the dangers of it. We went into lockdown on 26 June 2021 and as of Monday 23rd August, she placed a curfew, no one allowed out of their home between 9pm -5am. when this Delta outbreak began, she said 1,000sands are going to get the virus and 1,000sands are going to die. So far 130 have passed away, and I would be confident to say 100 died of old age and the rest died of other illnesses other than Delta. They even listed a 15yr old boy as a Covid death who was in Hospital for menningacoccal.
It is absolute Tyranny in the state of NSW. We are not even allowed to protest, the Government has given the Police force all powers to make sure of that.

1,"I agree, banning abortions causes more problems than it solves. Having said that, the overwhelming majority of abortions are done for pregnancies that occurred due to an accident.

You also just used the exact same argument that the loved ones of Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, and countless others have used. Did you defend them the same way?"
0,"Yep‚Ä¶and they have been pretty damned successful in doing so. Hell, they have dedicated television networks(Fox, OAN, Newsmax) that rarely(if ever) criticize Republican policy, in fact? They spin everything towards the GOP regardless of the merits or faults of GOP actions. Those same networks demonize Democrats on virtually everything.

Now, the right will say that the ‚Äúmainstream media‚Äù is the LIBERAL media, but that‚Äôs not true. They criticize Dems as well as Republicans. Look at the withdrawal from Afghanistan for example. Both the right wing media and the mainstream media are lambasting Biden for it. But, what no one(especially on the right) is saying is that Trump was the one who negotiated the withdrawal with the Taliban. It was supposed to be done in May, the Biden administration was able to get an extension to better organize it‚Ä¶.

It obviously wasn‚Äôt a long enough extension, but could you imagine what it would have looked like in May?

EDIT: another factor in this is human nature. Change(even good change) is scary to people. When people get nervous or fearful, they tend to draw back into the ‚ÄúDevil we know‚Äù stance. Combine that fear with the aforementioned right wing media groups stoking that fear, and this is another reason.

Because of all this, it always seems like the GOP can do pretty much whatever they want when they are in power, and the Democrats are always walking on eggshells. Because if they go too far or too fast? People panic and vote GOP the next election cycle‚Ä¶then they lose everything(again)."

0,"I listened to a couple episodes of Joe Rogan's podcast a couple months ago while at work. Wanted to see what all the hype around this guy was. I really only knew him from the sitcom ""Newsradio"" and ""Fear Factor"", time killers on NBC back in the day. So I listened, and his interviews where serviceable, and he had no great insight into anything with his commentary. Like most of his show was pleasant enough background, but the level his listeners think he's so smart and the $100 million dollar is baffling. Like he wasn't even a good entertainer really. Like Rush Limbaugh was a horrible man, but his show could be entertaining, and he was a brilliant broadcaster, if not a great commentator who would often say horrific things. However he could stretch nothing into hours of content. Rogan doesn't even have that going for him. So, basically, I don't get this guy at all. However, on a larger scale, he has gotten dangerous and Spotify needs to pull his contract."

0,"1.  Volunteer with your local chapter of the Democratic party.  Party planks and platforms are often written by the small number of people who bother to show up.  Having been involved with local democratic politics throughout my teens and early adulthood (I've had to stop since it's considered a conflict of interest with my current job) I can assure you, the people showing up are not always the people we want writing the party platform.  Most the people showing up have big financial interests in getting certain things done.  If we want democracy to work, we need to be more active in it.

2.  Vote in every election, especially at the local level.  The local level has huge influence on your day to day life, your vote carries more weight at the local level, and our next national level candidates have to get their start somewhere.  Voting in every election also means doing your homework.  Get to know the candidates.  For my most recent state delegate primary, I had a chance to talk with both the individuals on the ballot and got a solid feel for both.  It was clear the less funded guy was better to me, but he lost pretty decisively.  So few people do the homework so the woman with the slick mailers won.

3.  Run yourself.  As I already said, democracy only works if we work it.  If the people running aren't getting the job done, then someone else needs to step up.  And frankly, I'd rather vote for the reluctant candidate running to do the right thing than the person who really wants power.  I'm afraid of people who want power.

You'll notice my advice has nothing to do with this particular issue.  That's because if we don't get the foundation right, we will never be able to get the big stuff right.  It's all hard work I propose, no easy answers I fear."

0,"If any of you actually end up doing that, here are some tips on how to effectively poison a dataset. First, realize the most likely reason this website exists is to collect bounties on people, so the main goal is to make it too expensive for this to be profitable for them by making it impossible to distinguish between real and fake data.

1. Erite the reports yourself.. Don't use automated scripts to write the fake reports. Even if they're done pretty decently, this will make it way easier for them to filter things out. It could be from massive influence of reports at certain times, common patterns in language uses that the script writes, etc. Basically, they're easy enough to detect that it will only waste a little time assuming they have at least a few competent tech people behind the scenes.

2. Don't use names like Ted Cruz or Trump or anything like that. Even I could filter that shit out of a database. Even if they don't have the best help over  on the backend, they'll still Barely even be annoyed by something like that regardless of how many reports come on with those names. It barely takes any effort to remove anything with the word Trump in the name field from the database.

3. Most importantly,, you have to make them sound plausible. Now, don't give anyone's real name, that could lead to them getting harassed, death threats, lawsuits, etc. What you need to do is get a random, but jot obviously fake name, and description.

To repeat, the thing that will do damage isn't a large volume of fake reports, it's reports that can't be reliably deemed as junk data. There are plenty of tools to mitigate or negate the effects of DDOSing and hacking the website, but an effectively poisoned dataset has ko easy fix."
