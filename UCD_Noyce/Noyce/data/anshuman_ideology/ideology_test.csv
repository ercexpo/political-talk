1,""". . .Let's stay newsy. . .""   Apparently CNN doesn't report the news. 
[As if we didn't already know that.] 
Instead, they are instructed from the top to ACT ""newsy""."
0,"THEY are not undermining the US Constitution, but the politicians are.  And by allowing these corporate goons to exert such control, they are curtailing the rights of Americans.  And this will continue until enough Americans have 'had enough' and rise up to do something about it.  We'll see."
1,I’m seeing that the Democrats own the FBI as their own personal law enforcement agency. Name needs to be changed to Corrupt Politicians Bureau of Investigation 😡😡

1,"Constantly reminder that a cover up is needed to show Bidens AMERICA is going to change AMERICA.
I truly think Bidens AMERICA is not able to sell his plan of chaos.
Maybe China version is what he wants."
1,"Fair point. The Senate went through all that trouble with their parliamentarian to determine they could run a second reconciliation bill this fiscal year to ‘modify’ the earlier reconciliation bill, and….. nothing. I typically prefer divided government because nothing gets done. Turns out single-party rule under Democrats is pretty similar to divided government."

1,What’s wrong with the left ? Are they mentally ill and don’t know between right and wrong ? What if the terrorists blow up his house ? Is he still gonna defend them?
1,Republicans need to be frantically working to ensure that democrats and the are never allowed to steal another election. There is no other item of importance. Otherwise - get used to it.
1,"For sure. But we in turn also need to include what Native Americans did to each other. I went through high school thinking that the natives were all peaceful, nature loving victims. Not to disparage natives- I'm partly native myself (but not Cherokee), but natives, like Europeans, warred and conquered each other too. And yeah, when we got here, we fucked them over. Humans gotta human."
1,"Hey - the GA legislature can overturn the results of the vote! Don't ignore that one, it's the worst bit in this bad bill.

And stop with all the lies and be constructive."

1,We want Voter ID! Why is that so hard for the Democrats to understand... the 2020 election fiasco double proved for us all how badly we need it...
0,"Always great to hear from Ken KKKuccinelli. The same guy who said, on TV, that the poem on the Statue of Liberty (...give me your poor, etc...) only pertains to white people. Big surprise he is on the white supremacy channel."

) this guy would never be senator. Mike Lee needs to go too."
0,Real Lee Collins I think all that red hair dye has seeped into your thick skull. I bet you think Amy Schumer is hilarious.  You've clearly been drinking the kool-aid... don't scream when Trump is your President once again. You'll be okay.
1,I remembered this morning; George W. Bush getting the RFID going.  Now we have Elon Musk wanting to put a chip in our brains so we can be tied into a computer.

1," Sama Hi, do you have any articles or sources of illegally lowering identification for mail in ballots?
From my understanding, they probably won’t send you a mail in ballot unless you are already registered. Also, if a change is through a law, is it illegal? I’m pretty sure states have some authority over their voting laws, depending on what it is."
1,The left who accuses everyone who doesn’t agree with them of being intolerant. This same left tends to be super intolerant and racist to say the least. How embarrassing it must be to be that hateful

1,"Trueee.Like I'm so baffled how they can even defend people like stalin and Mao.
Also pretty weird how they will give the US so much shit for overthrowing leftist govts in the Americas yet will forget how many revolutions and reforms were crushed brutally by the Soviet Union.Like that was the cold war.OFC both the US and Soviet Union were dickheads 
Recently,some even defended China instead of Hong Kong.
Like,they need to sort themselves out."

1,"Yes, he's a Democrat. Only Republicans get arrested."
0,"Here are my predictions:

1) There will be a circular firing squad among the GOP candidates that'll leave them all so damaged they'll never be viable statewide candidates again.     
2) The recall will lose so badly the smart money among GOP funders will never back another statewide candidate or issue in California.     
3) The recall will lose, but the top candidate among the over 100 candidates will be an independent, Libertarian, or Green Party candidate."
1,Sav  Democrats in Pennsylvania gave new meaning to the phrase 'nothing to see here' when they covered-up the windows with cardboard.  It's on video.

1,"Can't deploy US troops unless the President declares a certain type of emergency like a national disaster, insurrection, times of war, and under a declaration of Martial Law....to list a few. 

Joe's handlers wouldn't have any of that shit going down in their country! Hell no. It would look bad on their resume."
0,Would be nice...spent 12 years on Texas saying every election cycle is rhe one...done with that. Move to a state you want...life is short and living in Texas as a Dem makes that existence intolerable.

0,"This is 100% the biggest flaw in our system, which the liberals promised to fix in 2015 by replacing first past the post with proportional representation. Doing so wouldn't have been beneficial to the liberals though, so they dropped the idea entirely."
0,"+mrruud010133
The man who held up the sign didn't cause this, the Trump supporters who attacked him did, & especially the person who said something about a gun.

1,I bet what these outlets hate most is that they will have to pay if they do not give back our former president's free speech. Makes me smile.
0,So you have a problem when people use uppers or does Trump I using uppers not count? Why do u think Trump sniffs all the dam time. FYI using drugs as you get older should not be looked down upon.
1,Almost like the same measures that help against covid help with the flu.
1,"Yeah, I worry his momentum is going to fade by 2024, and his health. 

He started the MAGA movement; that's good enough. I'd say he's done his part and took enough hits from it.

Time for someone new who they don't have a bunch of racists stories manufactured and ready to smear with"
0,"What?  The concept of a pre-existing condition was invented by insurance companies to exclude certain people from service.  It has no benefit to anyone, outside of shareholders of insurance companies.  

Discrimination based on previous illnesses should be illegal, there’s literally no benefit to anyone but the profiteers, and it’s incredibly harmful to anyone whom it is used against to justify denying coverage."

0,And the left would have anyone foolhardy enough to believe that they'll be winning back the House of Representatives this November.
1,Thank you so much for the vid. That young man did steal the show. If more of these heartwarming stories would be on national news there would not have the divide in this country. Trump 2020
1,This just proves your a political hate group! Do you really think other groups need special handling because they’re not as capable as you! Stop with your hate and thanking others are below you.
1,"trump didn’t attend the inauguration so that means the swearing in is not legitimate! trump is still president and Biden will be arrested by Secret Service for impersonating a President. It’s all part of the plan! 

- for all intents and purpose this is a joke. 

Fuck trump and fuck the idiot q morons."
1,They ready have. No one cares. Americans have learned to do nothing. Millenials are commie pinkos.
1,This absent minded old goat needs to resign and let someone that is well and has the knowledge of what to do take over-and NO nit that dingbat VP- SHE IS WORSE THAN HIM-2024 should take back the Senate and Congress and that will shut down all these hair brained ideas old Joe wants to do to try and declare he has done in his 47 yrs of nothing' Him and OBUMMER ARE TWO WORST EVER....
1,"Absolutely! He was totally on point, and was one of the most sincere sounding politicians I have heard in a long time. I think and I hope he captured the ears of fringe conservatives with his straight shooting approach.

DeSantis is balls with a brain. His sparring with the press is a cross between Trump and McEnany, and desperately needed. Frankly, however that ticket looks - it might be this country's last hope."

0,Most of the migrants are coming from Catholic countries & they don't believe in abortion. This republican narrative is completely false.
1,These are soulless anti American domestic terrorists. They need to be removed. If the government is going to continue to allow this to achieve their socialist agenda then Americans will end up stepping up to protect themselves and take matters into their own hands as per the constitution.
1,"First guy:
In general the more people that are in a position of power the better.....

No pal.... The more people in a position of power the more we lose our power as normal citizens!

1,Funny how this camera man was able to avoid the coverage of Alex Jones. Right side covered it.
1,"Excellent!!!  She should be forced to unblock her Twitter followers.  The court’s ruling needs to apply to ALL public officials, equally.  If it’s good for President Trump, when it’s good for Representative Ocasio-Cortez."
0,"Gaetz seems like a sleazebag. That said, the issue in court is likely to be proving that he knew the girl was 17. Gaetz and his friend both say she lied about her age and claimed to be 19. I have no idea about the credibility of the claim on either side, but the burden of proof is on the prosecution."

1," Hale Wrong.  Those were Democrats burning crosses.   Democrats oppose liberty at every turn.  Then watch as leftist thugs censor social media, invent thought crimes, and attack the 2nd amendment.  Now they want to enslave you to the Chinese and corporate America for a buck.  You will be replaced.  Same thing goes for establishment Republicans.  Worthless, the whole lot! May God bring moral people to bring about justice."

0,This is why nobody takes conservatives seriously.
1,The court is useless. Always giving the criminals the upper hand. They failed when it came time to save America when states illegally changed the election laws and now continue to fail America by ensuring our country is invaded by illegal aliens....
1," Patterson More whites are shot by the cops than blacks, but you won't know about that because it doesn't fit into the ""racist police"" narrative which the media and the left force feed the public every day!"

1,"I wish. Unfortunately, since they got away with cheating in the 2020 election, they will continue to cheat and win all future elections."
0,"All your comments have done is reinforce my beliefs about modern conservatives. You are willing to spite yourself and the states that form your core base as long as you can drag poor people down as well. This is a hateful and bitter ideology. I make decent money so your proposal would personally benefit me and I would still never support disenfranchizing millions of people, because dragging fellow Americans down for my own political gain is a cruel and evil thing to do."
1,If the news says they are being equal on their reporting. Why do all the liberal press say exactly the same words every report they do?
1,"This is explosive!
My thoughts at this point are: the Democrats must have known that the response from Trump would have been a lawsuit and investigation like this, given that their (democrats) fraud efforts were so blatant.  They must have realised that all of this would become public knowledge at some point - so how do they expect to counter this? What's their next move here?"
1,"So, suggesting Biden might want to investigate police violence because police should not be abusing citizens in the course of their duties is not good enough? Are Republicans not scared enough of Biden, so you have to put a little ooga-booga on it and bring up Obama?"

Your opponent is arguing against ""paying for other people's healthcare,"" despite having no clue whatsoever regarding what risk pooling is or what insurance does. Insurance of any kind, for any reason. Including the kind you can buy off the blackjack dealer.

NYC is a hub of business and tourism and education - thousands of people from nations across the globe come to this city every day - that’s why they got hit right at the beginning and so bad NOT because their Governor downplayed the seriousness of the disease !
1," Yoho Yes by an MIT professor.  The post office has also patented Block Chain voting.

1,"That’s exactly what happened.  This guy did one of his undercover recordings that highlight the political bias of CNN, and now Twitter is protecting CNN by preventing the story on their platform

Those are the exact facts.  And everyone in this sub is ok with it because it aligns with their own political biases

1,"As much as I think that Trump was a great president, I don’t want him to run in 2024. I’m tired of defending his stupid remarks. 

I’d much prefer Ron DeSantis to run. Ron is like Trump but he speaks better and has less stupid blunders. I don’t think Trump can win either, his reputation has been tarnished. 

Assuming that the 2020 election was fair, Trump lost for two reasons: 

Trump kinda abandoned the populist rhetoric that got him elected in 2016, his entire campaign strategy in 2020 was just calling Biden a socialist.

The second reason was that his blunders almost overshadowed his campaign, I really didn’t like some of his rhetoric but I still supported him.

If Trump wants to win in 2020 he really needs to bring back his 2016 campaign style and be more careful with his bad phrasing."
1,"The only ones supporting the PLANdemic any more are the politicians.Isn

1,"White leftists shamelessly use minorities to hammer white conservatives.

1,"even though fuck manchin this is a good development. 

the article is silent about it, but the Gates Foundation is one of the primary lobbyists to keep the IP in place. the PR from it is so good because everything in public viewpoint is how Bill Gates predicted this pandemic, is putting fourth money to protect humanity from this in the future, etc. Meanwhile working tirelessly to protect the IP and fuck poorer countries because that's muh property."

1," Bidén Sorry for misunderstanding. No excuse who ever it was but too many black hoodies, face covering and backpacks to be Trumps supporters.

1,If the election was won fair and square by Dems.....then why did they attempt to stop the AZ election audit by filing lawsuits and lost all of them in court and now have called on DOJ to stop the audit. It appears that the Dems are trying to hide something in AZ. Once the democrats win begins to unravel it may not look so “fair and square” anymore.

Georgia's voters are getting a taste of real leadership for the first time in a long time, and the GOP should be very, very scared for their future in this state.

Edit: I can also vouch for ATL and Savannah, OP. Progressive and cool af. Once we flip the state legislature next year, GA will reach its final east-coast-California form."

Get the distinctions right."

1,"Half of the world might've been mocking Trump's bombastic personality and unconventional style, but they were still taking him very seriously, particularly our adversaries (China, Iran, North Korea, unorganized Islamic terror groups like ISIS, and sometimes Russia).

I haven't seen anecdotal evidence of ANY country, even those who are our allies, of taking Biden seriously. And our adversaries and enemies, particularly China, do not take him seriously at all, as evidenced by the bold lecturing China gave US diplomats in Anchorage recently. 

Biden's gaffes, flubs, confusion, extended absences and ""senior"" moments aren't just noticed by the American public and media. Other world leader's are taking notice, and most assuredly planning on taking advantage.

Sure, Trump had his bloviating, outspoken, off-the-cuff and, sometimes, clownish moments, but adversarial nations still refrained from crossing him bc they knew he was very serious, very confrontational and oftentimes aggressive. This has yet to be seen in Joe."

Honestly if they need to reelect him it kind of walks over his legacy. 

Trump was a one term president and that's all he needed to be. 

He completely altered and helped correct the political fabric of the world. 

To reelect him is to say he couldn't get it done the first time around. 

I don't agree with this, we need a new person a new approach to keep expanding the mission."

Come to think of it they're also rather active on several subreddits such as as well.  Most of the ones downvoting you will be either bots or the 50 Cent Army who mainly get paid for writing pro-China stuff but they will also do it for the Democratic Party and against Republicans.

1,"Is the division actually worse? If we go back 20 years people weren't anymore involved in debating each other.

MSM went from being biased to the left to full on propaganda. So yes sources of news are no longer unified among the population.

1,lol Bill never paid a dime himself Fox did lol. And those were defamation settlements basically because the accusers couldn't prove shit in court but if they went public with their bogus claims it would have had an impact on his show's ratings and pressured advertisers to withdraw their ad buys.

Guess it depends how you define fair share. 

The 400 richest people pay a lower effective tax rate on each dollar than the bottom 50% in the US. If we're defining fair as a percentage rather than gross figure, would be a good place to start. 

Corporate welfare and Gov't handouts are another place where the system doesn't seem to reflect a fair distribution of costs or benefits."

1,"No it's not. Even without the legal process - Trump can actually still win this. The coming recount might be enough. Not to mention what the SC will say if massive fraud is properly proven. Anyhow, we all wonder - what kind of a heart does it take to celebrate an election won by fraud? Feels good? Not that I think you actually have a heart, but still.

0,"There's loads of footage taken live from the riots by the Trump supporters themselves showing people in body armour. Some also wearing helmets. There's even a few in gas masks.

Why deny reality?"
1,"364 people were killed by rifles in 2019 according to fbi. For comparison, 12,000 people die every year falling down the stairs. Being concerned that “mass shootings” are an epidemic in this country is a media gaslighting narrative"
1,"Needs to be put away, very dangerous. Can you imagine if he doesn't get help, many will suffer and die. Can't let the liberal courts let him go free."
1,"It's isn't even any sort of awareness. The second line is the most basic argument literally every leftist makes. 

What this demonstrates is that these guys don't ever listen other arguments and just argue with strawmen in their echo chambers all day. They are dishonest bad faith arguers who only like hearing the sound of their own voice."
1," you advocate peace as Buddha while calling the other side ""tea baggers"" making it derogatory <-- not cool... the R who are saying it goes too far haven't read the legislation. If you are an immigrant the law says you have to have have that green card on you at all times period. Don't like what it says then change the law that has been in existence for over 70 years  Legislation does NOT imply what U suggest regarding the park or walking"

1,"So..? What racist rhetoric is he getting at? My kids are past that, thankfully. These days days I would rather have a choice of my kids going to a private school, not an indoctrination camp run by the liberal teachers union. Biden wants to add 4 years of school, teachers don’t even want to go back..🤔"
1,"Another Democrat using the 3 letter gov agencies to take out their rivals. Sound familiar? Let me give you a hint... Hitler, Stalin, Pol-Pot, Amin, ... get the picture? Every single/marxist regime in history has used the government agencies to take out their opposition. Their doctrine cannot stand the light of day, or criticism! It fades when exposed!

Where is the MSM? Crickets!"
1,"Excuse me, but according to the left, ALL religions are right-wing! And if Joe Biden supports abortion in any way, shape or form, then he is a very poor example of a Catholic! Same for Nancy Pelosi!"
1,"All they ever talk about is Covid. Immigration, economy, diplomacy of foreign Nations are never of topic. Tax and spend is all they will ever do. Impeach the entire cabinet."

1,I can see it in the dark bags under his eyes that Bill always had even when he was young. Also his chin and his nose. If you look at his twitter there's a couple of side by sides that stand out. Also consider that if Bill Clinton knows for sure he's not the father he should have had DNA a long time ago because the rumor has been dogging him for a long time and it's bad for business.

1,It wasn’t Trump supporters that invaded the Capitol.
0,">One reason for this is that DNA is included, so is Trump trying to hide bastards? Or keep them from suing for a slice of the pie?

It probably has something to do with E Jean Carroll, a woman who has been trying to get a sample of Trump's DNA for a long time in order to prove that he raped her. They've been fighting in court over his DNA for quite some time now. With Trump's lovely track record when it comes to women, I'm sure there are others."

0,The whole world can see election fraud.  I'm in Europe and this is blatantly obvious.
1,If people understood that their choices matter and they have free will the Democrats would have no platform. They need people to be angry at an invisible enemy to push their agenda.
1,There is only one reason why they banned Trump from social media and that is he taught America to pay attention to what the Dem party is really all about...he tweeted the truth something the Dems fear for the people learn...Thank you Trump for your enlightenment🇺🇸
1,"As a Canadian, I see our country fighting the problems because of our “liberal” government."
1,If the election was won fair and square by Dems.....then why did they attempt to stop the AZ election audit by filing lawsuits and lost all of them in court and now have called on DOJ to stop the audit. It appears that the Dems are trying to hide something in AZ. Once the democrats win begins to unravel it may not look so “fair and square” anymore.

1,"Nothing has changed. Otherwise, we would have a pile of Democrats in prison right now. The letter agencies are extremely partisan. The evidence is in who gets investigated and who doesn't.  
  
The fact that you said the double standard has been changed is not apolitical. Indeed, it's **very** political. Again, look at who is getting raided and who gets softball interviews where they're not having to give statements under oath. There's no question it's political in nature."

1,"IMHO-- I think that the best thing that Trump can do right now is: To do every thing in his power to flip the Senate red and flip the House red by a large majority for 2022 elections. Then he can work on 2024. By doing this, his efforts to win the House and Senate will make him unstoppable for 2024."

1,"If they seriously planned on a coup, they would have been heavily armed. As far as we know, literally no one was armed. Considering most of these people own guns, that just doesn't make sense that this was an attempt to overthrow the government.

This was an angry mob, definitely, but by comparison to the hundreds of mobs beating people senseless over the summer, it was comparatively tame."

0," Anding Just a reminder, the courts have thrown out 40 cases of voter  fraud so far. Some of the judges are Trump appointees. None of these allegations have held up in court thus far. Just because you want something to be true, doesn’t make it so. You need CREDIBLE evidence."

1,Not really. The Klan were Democrats too.
1,If this is normal we are in deep 💩. The man has done nothing in the 50 odd years he has been in government and now he is the savior of our country. I am old but I am not senile. And this is certainly not giving Americans any hope for our next 4 years. 😞😞

Well, technically whites still make a majority, but the amount and diversity of minorities, and the historic relations between all these ethnicities and races in America could be a problem for the messaging of a SocDem party in America.

Both of these counties comfortably voted for Obama before shifting hard to the right and voting for Trump in 2020.

Also insurance companies are motivated solely by profit, when they deny coverage or make essential drug subject to “prior authorization,” this means absolute hell to the people on the receiving end, and it’s all related to insurance profit.  Insurance is a cancer on healthcare in America, and it’s caused massive problems and even preventable deaths for millions of people."
