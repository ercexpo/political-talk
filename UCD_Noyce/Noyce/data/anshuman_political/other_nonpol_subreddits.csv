Congrats on the purchase man. I am looking to sell at least two of the vehicles in my flair and get a 2002-04 z06. Found a 2004 with 105k miles for 18k and I am debating. It is red and I really want to get a blue. it seems like you love your Z06

"I could see that sentiment with Hail to the King to an extent but have you given The Stage a listen? It was weird for me at first but it’s grown to be my favorite of theirs by far. Nightmare is really the only album that comes close. 

Their earlier stuff is still amazing but, outside of City of Evil and Nightmare, it hasn’t aged very well. To me, it feels less like they lost their soul and more like they’re growing up and their music is maturing with them. 

It would be weird if they went the Weezer route and just kept writing angsty teenager type songs like what got them big. The Stage is them at their most focused and progressive while still firing on all cylinders. It’s like the back half of City of Evil but trim some of the fat and bombast and give it a more defined theme. I love it so much."

Very offtopic but I was looking into a 2018 Mazda 3 GT 6MT how do you like yours?
"The one main thing lacking from the base Maverick is cruse control. Though if you're just stop and go commuting for the most part (rather than just highway cruising) I can see regular buyers still getting it.

Obviously that missing cruise control can be answered by the aftermarket, but not a lot of new car buyers are comfortable with that (probably more for the fleet buyers for that aftermarket add in)."

"You're missing the point if you think the cost of the pick up truck is some sort of counterpoint. A small 2 seat coupe destined for the track with bad gas mileage should not be slower, let alone a half second slower than a truck designed to haul brings, trailers and work people. And yes, I can absolutely compare fwd cars to rwd ones. Being rwd doesn't make it magically in a class of its own, especially considering those fwd cars beat it around the track too. I myself went from a MS3 to S2000 and then MS3 again. I know people that are opting to get the Si instead because of fuel economy. Rwd be damned, if the car is lacking in important areas, it doesn't matter."

"I agree with you on some points - who the hell asked for the Kona N? Do people really walk into car dealerships without a prior expectation of what they want, and then get impressed by the Nurburgring inspired badge slapped on a grocery getter? I could’ve seen an argument for it’s existence if it had AWD or something, but as it is, I personally don’t see the appeal.

The alt type R comparison is pretty valid - though in my eyes they’re different enough to coexist in a similar market space. That being said, maybe I got lucky, because I got my Veloster N for under MSRP with little to no hassle (just waiting - because I wanted arguably the most desirable spec, performance blue, post-mid cycle refresh with the manual transmission). Meanwhile, every type R in a huge radius of me was being treated like some special super car. I couldn’t really find a brand new one south of 50k (with some being north of 70-80k, comical), and the used ones were costing 10k+ over what I paid for my N. Even if I liked the R more, I couldn’t have justified that. There are much better purchases at that price point, IMO.

I think the Elantra N will do well enough, better than the Veloster did. It’s not my cup of tea, but the interior looks like an upgrade to the Veloster, and it is surely a bit more practical with four doors."

A coworker who was in high school was in the market for a first car (that her likely wealthy parents would buy) she googled safe cars and found the 2016 Mini Countryman on a list.

"I'm interested in seeing their enthusiast offerings. I can see the Lynk & Co 03+ being popular with Volvo fans and maybe even sway some WRX buyers. Makes me hope that Geely will give Proton enthusiasts a bone, but L&C's crossover lineup looks convoluted and confusing though. The upcoming MG ev-roadster will be interesting to see.

I recently learnt that the Buick Verano Pro GS has a 1.5T engine making 181 hp... and only has a CVT. No idea about its track capability (if any). Nice looking sedan, but I doubt the GS would satisfy buyers in non-Chinese markets."
"I wouldn't agree but to each their own, there's still a difference between something like a mustang with back seats and a Corvette even if they are both front engine manual cars. Each model of car has a following, and front engine manual Corvette's will be sought after.

Your remark that a Front engine manual corvette won't be a classic because they made so many? What about all those old 60-70s car. They made them by a boat load to, guess what? Classics, all of them. The front engine Corvette and the manual Corvette is dead, it doesn't matter how many they made, they will become classics."

"I don't think it would be. Driving enthusiastically is very inefficient. If it takes 15 miles to get to ""the fun roads"" or ""the beach"" or whoever you want to drive, you now only have 60 miles to enjoy when you get there. If you are driving with purpose that could cut down to about 25. That is like 30 min of fun driving before you have to turn around and go home."

"This too--the low trucks of the '60s-'80s (like the low cars) were the aberration, not the norm."
Doubt you'll see a big HP bump. The Supra got one because the B58 engine was already putting out those larger numbers in other cars and was likely under rated in Year 1.

"I grew up in these cars and I still adore them.  In high school 3 of my buddies had them all with manuals and my parents both had them as well (moms was an auto dads was a cobra).  

They are so much fun to beat the fuck out of even though they aren’t really fast at all.  The shifter feel and sound they make is awesome for what they are.  I miss all of those cars."
"Honestly though, i swear not even 1% of this sub actually takes their cars to a proper track. I don't get why it's always an arguing point on these subs. Most hardly push their car around turns enough for it to even matter.

"So you really think something needs to be used every day to justify its existence? Really?  Hell something doesn't need to be used even in a quarter of driving scenarios to be considered useful.

The fact is that most cars will likely see some highway use. Especially in america where we are a nation connected by a highways and interstates and people generally live pretty spread out. In this country people have come to expect cruise control in consumer vehicles and even irregular usage of a few times a year more than justifies adding it for the overwhelming majority of people."

"I realize this is an extremely unpopular opinion around these parts - but the GTI. Don't get me wrong - the GTI is great, and probably has the right amount of hype for what it delivers. The problem is the regular Golf. It was even more true 2016-2018 while the Golf had the 1.8T with 180hp and the GTI had the 2.0T with 210hp. For 99% of GTI buyers, the regular Golf would have cut it just fine, for significantly less money. I feel like the regular Golf was ever even mentioned. It was to the point where you'd see people ask ""should I buy a GTI or a Focus ST/Civic Si"" (makes sense) but also ""should I buy a GTI or a base model Elantra"" (u wut m8).  But the GTI hype train was so strong that ultimately NA market won't see the non-GTI Mk8 Golf because we collectively forgot they exist.

TL;DR - GTI good. But regular Golf is perfectly good too, and idk that the GTI is more gooder for the price, for most people."
Most trucks these days have shift up and down buttons.
"I think at the very least the resellability of the GTI makes it more attractive than the regular golf. Usually the base models initially depreciate incredibly quickly in comparison with the GTI. When I bought mine it was the cheapest in the country with under 100k kilometers (I got a great deal because the dealerships have been closed for months and the market hadn't gotten crazy yet) and it was still 5k (cad) more than a similar condition non GTI.

Having owned one in all honesty there's no reason to buy a golf that's not a GTI. There are quite a few issues that you would not have if you bought a Honda or toyota, and it cost a lot more to fix the issues than it would on a Ford or Chrysler. So if you're not interested in the performance there's better cars to buy."

"Honestly it's a very straightforward process! The hardest part is finding a dealer with an allocation for what you want (note some brands like Honda don't do orders at all). You may have to call around and it can take some time. You just call and ask if they have an allocation to order the model you want. Basically you just choose exactly all the options you want (via the build configurator online) and send them what you want. 

You then decide on price (for orders it's usually hard to negotiate....your leverage is kind of gone. Do not let them mark you up though. MSRP should be what you get charged, if not less) Then you have to usually put down a 1k refundable deposit, but for rare colors or hard to sell options it may be 2k non refundable. These deposits count towards your down payment too. 

Of note is that rebates and discounts only apply upon delivery of the car, so any summer sales etc they are having may not apply when your car is delivered. 

From there you get a tracking number (production number or VIN) and wait for the next 5-8 weeks. The tracking number shows all the steps it goes through manufacturing and delivery. On the date of delivery you sign off, submit financing, any rebates etc applied, and drive off like any other car! 

Just be prepared to wait, and know that it really is quite a bit harder to negotiate. Realistically custom ordering is not an option for saving money or getting the best price. But it does result in maybe saving money by not paying 7k for an option you don't need that's on a similar model on the lot. Though it really is a rewarding experience. At the end of the day, it's a car built with the options YOU want and it's made for YOU. All in all I think its worth it and good fun to try once! Tracking your car getting built is really fun :)"

"I feel like the Focus ST and Focus RS need a mention here.

The regular 2.0 ecoboost isn’t a bad engine by any means, but it’s the archetypal definition of a normal engine.

But paired the excellent clutch and shifter of the ST and it’s quite the entertaining car and acceleration feels effortless, for lack of a better word. 

Likewise, the amount of fun the RS is able to coax out of the 2.3 ecoboost should be illegal.  Obviously that has a lot to do with the drivetrain, but it’s one hell of a complete package.

I’m a die hard NA v8 guy but the ecoboost focuses have made me change my entire perspective on what a good turbo car feels like... and a lot of that has to do with the clutch and shifter feel.  By far the best manual transmissions I have ever driven in an “economy” car."

C7 just looks like every other Corvette of the last 25 years… which if that’s your thing great.. but the change is great IMO.
To each their own. To me the C8 looks like a super car while the C7 looks like a plastidipped vette. Hopefully the Z06 C8 sounds a bit better though.
I drive a matrix xrs with the auto and it kills the fun. Driving around the issues the auto introduces can add some fun but overall it's a boring car with a boring transmission. If I were handed 10 million dollars I'd probably see about getting a 5 or 6 speed automatic installed.
I'm listening through your music now. So far I'm digging it. Thanks for the tunes

Yeah but I brought up the Matrix for a reason - everything smallish with a manual that Toyota made during that time period was very light compared to now.  That Matrix only weighed about 2600lbs as well!
Yea ive been meaning to yank the engine and trans and find something to throw it in after a rebuild. Itd certainly be fun in some old crown vic.

That would be a likely explanation. I can’t help but feel like if they had brought a traditional 4 door hatchback instead of the 3 door it would’ve sold better. I guess we’ll have to see how the Kona N sells but I feel like it’s a very niche market since the average person has no idea what N is. The Elantra N seems promising but I just can’t get over the looks

"A 4x4 is objectively worse at 4x4 and towing activities. 

This is seriously pointless offer a less useful transmission on a utility vehicle. 

I’m not sure if you’ve ever wheeled but modulating a manual up a steep hill is a good way to burn up your clutch and is not nearly as precise. 

Also the 4x4 electronic systems don’t work well if at all on a manual car. 

Same thing with towing. An easy way to destroy your clutch on take off. 

Not to mention basically nobody would buy these"

I don't think its the amount or placement of the red in that Volvo that makes it look more modern. Its the fact that it isn't using shitty fake shiny leather that looks like vinyl. Throw a big screen in that RX-8 and  sand the shine off that leather and it would look reasonably modern.

"Great steering too, it's a really solid car for the money. Needs a LSD though. 

Big mistake not allowing buyers to purchase the manual with the tech package and an absolutely baffling choice to eliminate the blind spot monitors and rear cross traffic warning, which was standard on lower trims. 

Great shifter, gear box and nice, short, tight clutch that you can feel grab and the release point, but the engine feels grainy and strained with the manual and the DCT is almost too seamless and artificial, feels sort of like a CVT, even if it makes the engine feel smooth and the powerband creamy."

I'd write an in depth response as to why poor people like me are excited about affordable fun cars that aren't 10yr old molested g35s, but as you've said in many of your videos, you're spoiled by your experiences in incredible cars so I'm not going to bother.

"My teenage daughter asked me about Good 4 U. I think its fine. Basically inoffensive pop-punk. I guess there always has to be someone riding that sound. Avril wasn't the first, but she was probably the most popular. I enjoy that sound.

But I didn't realize that Rodrigo was also behind other songs that I've heard on the radio. She's got some range. Definitely some talent. Hopefully she grows out of super-processed studio music and brings something more real down the line. For now she's fine. Kind of safe and mediocre but I think she could be a lot more. 

And she is getting overplayed. That may sink her."
"Had one of these as a loaner and wasn't impressed. I hated the interior and that touch pad. Felt like you were pretty much just buying the badge and I'd rather get something from a non-luxury brand for the same price. 

Edit: I don't mean to imply this is a bad car or that I'm comparing it to other higher priced cars. It's just not for me. In general I'm not a huge fan of the entry level luxury segment because for me personally I'd rather save the money and/or get a higher trimmed VW, Mazda, etc."

People paying $15k over sticker for a Telluride gets me too smh.
I said this after Tom Petty left too soon: the next 20 years are going to straight up suck for rock n roll.
"I can’t speak to the strength of the brand, but as the owner of an Elantra GT N-Line 6MT I have to say I love the product. Nice chassis, great shifter (no rev hang!) and just enough power to have fun while also being very practical and economical. Shame it’s already out of production with no hatchback successor planned."
The engine is from the Infiniti Q50/Q60s.
Can you further expand on why manuals are good for hill descent? I've also never done 4x4 so in my head going downhill safely probably consists of being in neutral and using the brakes to modulate speed.

"It has to do with RPM.  60mph in 4th gear is probably around 3000 RPM.  If you downshift to 3rd, your RPMs will jump to 4000, which is still below the 7000 RPM redline.  You'll be fine.

Money shift happens when you're in 3rd gear at 6500 RPM and accidentally shift down into 2nd gear instead of 4th.  The RPMs exceed the 7000 rpm redline and breaks stuff."

"I don't think N is a joke, it's hardly 5 years old as an idea and has only been selling cars for a little over 2 of those years. Not to mentioned they only have 2 models on sale in Europe and 1 in NA. They simply haven't had the time to build a following, although people who have bought them are generally pleased because they offer a great deal of performance for a good entry price. And there's the key factor: price. Some of the fastest FWD cars on sale and in history and they aren't luxury brands that aren't affordable for average people. It doesn't have the prestige of luxury performance divisions because it isn't, which brings me to my second point: Albert Bierman and the rest of the gang at N are doing to Hyundai what he and the folks at M, AMG, and Audi RS did to their lineup which is to make performance variants of their regular models. I don't see any criticism for those performance brands, rather only praise. So what's wrong with creating such a model for people who don't make over $50K/year but want a new performance vehicle? I think N will enjoy a lot of success and they will rightfully earn it."

"Personally, I heard about the upcoming Elantra N before I heard that they were making a Kona N, and since the Elantra N has all the right stuff I'd want in an enthusiast-friendly daily driver, the Kona N sort of blew right by me.

If the question is about whether the Kona N devalues the N brand as an up-and-coming performance contender... honestly, I don't think the average person is gonna pay much attention anyway, unless they're at a dealership and notice a weird bright-blue crossover-thing with a wing on the back. But I don't think the average person is gonna walk out of a Hyundai dealership just because they've become aware of its existence.

And if the upcoming Elantra N is as good as I hope it will be, then the existence of the Kona N is of no consequence. Non-car people don't care, and car people will always have opinions that don't actually affect what they choose to buy or not buy."
"His first review was pretty positive too, he just was not feeling the dealership network which he repeats in pretty much all Kia-Hyundai reviews and that it isn't quite in the Type R's class from the mechanical point of view.

His ""mistake"" was making the Chernobyl reference in the title that everybody took as him being down on the Veloster N."
Latinx? PASS
Every Jason Cammisa vid I’ve seen looks like it was produced by BuzzFeed and a target audience of 12 year old boys with ADHD.
"I should clarify here, I mentioned being a fan of the ITR and honestly it was *the* car that got me into cars. A coworker/friend had a Phoenix Yellow and that coupled with playing Gran Turismo and other games with that car and other reasonably attainable ones (like the NSX) fueled the passion. 

For the JDM and EDM markets, Honda continued with several other R models (Accord Type R, Accord Euro R, Civic Type R, etc) but the US market didn't get them. When the S2000 was released it's certainly not a 'R' model like the CTR, ITR, or NSX-R it is a special vehicle and I've enjoyed owning it for the past ~11 years or so. 

I'm new to German vehicles but the GTI and Golf R have always been on the radar as well as M and AMG vehicles. I have several friends that own those and so I've gotten to experience them and own a Stage 2 Golf R. 

Hyundai hasn't done anything to 'wow' myself or most of the market from what I've seen that would sway me to their N vehicles. If I wanted a FWD performance car it'd be the CTR without any hesitation. As you stated the CTR is both more practical and a better car than the Veloster, why would I choose the Veloster? 

Same for the [Elantra N](https://www.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/vehicles/2022-elantra-n), why would I choose that over the CTR? 

I didn't even know about the [Kona N](https://www.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/vehicles/2022-kona-n) until this post and I can definitely say I don't have any interest in it either. The Golf R has proven itself to be incredibly capable and quick - though it is at a slightly higher price point ($35k vs $42k). 

For the Integra, nostalgia is definitely playing a part of the interest. I test drove the TLX Type-S and while I wanted to love it the car was just okay. For the money the M, AMG, or IS500 vehicles are more appealing. 

Competition is great, but the N lineup just doesn't do anything for me to change up my current vehicles."
Stupid question but didn't the Type R have overheating and transmission issues?
"Dried up puke hidden under the passenger seat that I couldn't see or smell during my initial inspection before purchase. Note to potential buyers, move the seats up and town while checking a car out to look for any of these hidden things."
"It's more than that though, the drummer is the whole underlying mechanics of the music. Ringo is *amazing*, and I dunno what it takes but there does seem to be something you need to get people to hear it, that without that drumming the whole recording has no centre and the performance of ""the song"" has no consistent momentum.

If I could describe it better, maybe it wouldn't take having to do everything all the way up to almost learning drums to get drummers to play in time consistently for 2 1/2 minutes, haha. *Some* people have metronomic timing just in their blood flow, but so far of the even tempered people I've met, none of them were drummers.

I've learned to practice guitar real slow and with a metronome, and that's helped me keep drummers in time. 

Ringo on those Beatles recordings is why that fucking recording exists. 

So Charlie Watts, mate, ""never a flashy drummer"", Rolling Stones are a flashy as fuck band, and their ability to express ""the song""'s entire muscular structure is Charlie Watts."

The Veloster N is manufactured in Korea.
"Hang on. If the automatic is rated by Toyota to do 6.6 sec (can't recall too well), how is the manual going to be doing 5.6-5.9 sec just out there on the streets (where no one launches)? Part of the reason manuals, sometimes, get a quicker 0-60 is because of the ability to launch them more aggressively. I just don't see it doin' sub 6 very often. Toyota says 6.1 sec. 

Being NA and manual means its got a more linear powerband (now more than ever) and will benefit most by trapping higher in the 1/4 mile - turbos usually have quicker 0-60s due to low end torque - more low and mid range than upper rpms.  So my take is this will be faster in the ET and trap slightly higher vs its auto counterpart.

I still stand that out there on the streets this will range in the 6.3-6.5, maybe 6.2 sec. (Good temps, DA, traction)."

"Right, so a V6 Camry competes with the new 86 in 0-60. Standard unmodified minivans, not so much. The 2020 Sienna was 1 second slower.

"> Is this really the best Ford can do? 80k F150 in 2024? 

Compared to 0 Cybertrucks forecasted by Tesla in the same year?  Doesn’t seem so bad to me."
"In terms of looking at historical precedence for vehicles like this, there’s very little evidence this would be a hit. Previous attempts at pushing similar vehicles have failed sometimes pretty spectacularly and the us market often doesn’t look favorably on buying smaller vehicles. Compact trucks went away a decade ago due to poor sales and unibody designs have never sold well. It’s honestly still up in the air as to weather or not Ford can actually push midsize truck buyers into a smaller vehicle or convert cuv buyers to the utility of a bed vs covered storage with this. 

On top of that the fact this sub though it would be a smash hit is sometimes a great indication it won’t. Lol. 

Jokes aside. I think Ford has a really compelling offering here for a lot of buyers but it’s by no means a guaranteed hit."

"I’m not sure where you got that info from.  The Gen 4 Escape FHEV is rated for 200HP and 155lb-ft of torque total, while the Maverick is rated for 191HP and the same 155lb-ft.  The petrol engine in the Maverick is rated for 162HP and 170ft-lb on its own, while the Escape’s is 168HP and the same 170ft-lb.  

The entire difference in horsepower is more than accounted for by the petrol engine’s lower peak figure.  Judging by the fact peak power arrives 650RPM sooner in the Maverick, it was probably tuned differently to give it a broader torque and power curve compared to the Escape’s version."

"Oh hey it's Gooseman.

I'm all for more enthusiast models. I feel like the N branded cars all absolutely ace the soft-qualities that enthusiasts like. Lightweight, functional infotainments, the classic Korean suite of features, LSD, non-dead exhausts, MT offerings, and DCTs for the autos, and most importantly affordability. 

However, I also think the N brand misses the mark in terms of allure and prestige. There's just something about it that doesn't convince me it's a serious performance brand - and doing what you're saying - adding it to obscure vehicles like the Kona isn't helping. Hyundai should have established N's prowess and seriousness first before making performance variants of appliances. They should have focused on the I30N Fastback (seriously that car is fucking dope why don't we get it), Elantra N, and topped it off with a G70N as a halo car/rwd sport sedan to show what they're capable of."

"This is literally what I’m trying to say, idk if I’m coming off unclear?

You said there was some historical precedence working against the maverick - I’m saying it’s fuel economy and base price is separating it from past midsize and small trucks. I’m trying to say this is an entirely new add to the current market."
"You’re actually on point with something. IIRC the top trade-ins for Tesla’s were like the Honda Civic, Honda Accord, and the Toyota Camry; your usual basic sedans. So people that were in say, a Honda Civic for X years get into a Tesla and immediately are blown away because it looks upgraded from their old Honda or Toyota. But yea, if you were coming from a Porsche or a BMW you’ll feel disappointed in what Tesla has to offer, outside of being electric…though even that niche is disappearing as more electric cars from other brands appear. 

I once read here on Reddit that Tesla’s are luxury cars for people that have never owned or sat in a luxury car before. I think that statement still stands."

"Jetta TDI strangely. My dad owned a 2010 (yay dieselgate) growing up.

That DSG was a great gearbox. I always loved riding the torque wave and shortshifting it at 2000rpm. You could shift it fast too, BAM BAM BAM BAM. The shifts were perfectly smooth regardless of throttle posistion or RPM and the gearbox felt incredibly well matched to the engine. Even today, I drive new cars that have worse shifting characteristics compared to that thing. 

And considering it was an ecobox diesel, it was actually a pretty peppy car, especially for the time before every car had a 2.0T gas motor."

"Most SBC engines are not inspiring, especially in stock form. People don't love the LS1 in my car because of how much fun the engine is or how good it feels; they love it because it makes good power and torque in a good package and is reliable and affordable to maintain and fix.

But - even the LS1, LS2, etc with a T56 or TR6060 are an absolute hoot. Put it behind a 4- or 6-speed slushbox and they're meh on the fun scale. Wind one out in 2nd or 3rd? It sounds and feels way more fun. Excellent transmissions, they let you shift at redline, stout, good feel (with a good shifter, anyways), etc."

If someone has a total commute of 30-50 miles in a day and they are worried that in 4-5 years that new EV tech would vastly out-pace their vehicle in terms of safety and performance then this would be a decent lease car.

"It is skewed here, I know. But it looks like the Bronco Sport sales numbers have been very good so far. 2021 sales are over 60,000 so far.

My wife's VW sold more than that just last year. We saw one about a month ago. And when someone gave us crap about the VW, it's made in Tennessee, while my Buick came from Germany. But blind support for 'Merica."
"Of the last dozen plus street racers/lane weavers I’ve seen, 80% were Infinity G series cars, with the remainder filled in by Nissan sedans and Honda Accords. One brand new Ecoboost Mustang about two months ago, and one GTI wanted to see if the TTS was competitive. (They were *exactly* the same.)

The G series drivers looove to see if they can take my RS. They can’t."
Thank you! Finally someone other than me. OG or 1997?
"I own the 1.6t Kona. Anyone who talks shit about the Kona simply hasn’t driven one. Technically it is a cuv but it drives like a sporty hatchback. Calling it a small suv (like a lot of car reviewers do) is a joke. It’s barely taller than most hatchbacks or sedans. With its stiffer suspension than most cuvs or hatches or sedans, it actually handles quite well. If you forget the marketing, it is for all intents and purposes a sporty hatchback. It drives as well as a Mazda3 from my experience. The N version should be fantastic.

Also, OP called it obscure, but there’s no way that’s true anymore. I see tons of Konas on the road these days."

However, for my money, I’m willing to bet that they’ll just call it the Challenger, and that’ll be the successor to the current iteration."
"Not junk. The previous owner though ""oh boy! Long life oil? I guess this means that I dont need to check it ever, either?"" And then proceeded to not check the oil ever. On an engine that is notorious for burning oil.

"This. The telluride was sold out constantly *before* any kind of shortage. Same issue with the carnival now (though now one *could* chalk it up to the shortage, it, like the telluride, it's the highest rated minivan on sites like motor trend, car and driver, etc, so maybe a column A/B kind of deal).

The front engine manual corvette is now a classic in much the same way as well... nope; it's the same as any other domestic FR manual.

"Thanks for your reply.  I was fortunate enough to spend a few years with the M2C but took advantage of the current ridiculous used car market.  While the M2C is amazing, it's a lot of power on the street.  The BRZ seems like it would be loads of fun, great for the occasional track day, easy to maintain etc. (and less than half the price).  I only had the pleasure of test driving the BRZ once and it was around the time when the first gen was released.  I remember it feeling like a go-kart.

If nothing else, the BRZ's seem to hold their value well (like most Subarus).  I'm excited to see what the G87 M2 will bring, but that's 1.5 years away.  There aren't many options in the RWD, manual transmission, I need backseats category.  BRZ, Camaro/Mustang, M3/M4, CT4/CT5 Blackwing, 911.  

The BRZ seems like it would be a lot of fun in day-to-day driving without hitting ""i'm going to get arrested"" speeds."
I’ve emailed a Subaru dealership about pre-ordering/reserving the BRZ (same car as 86). Assuming Toyota has the same policy it can definitely be done but I didn’t get that far into it.

"The hp bump won't happen imo because of several factors. If it's much quicker, they're concerned about losing sales from the Supra, just as Subaru is from the WRX. Personally I doubt many are cross shopping those cars but look how long it took Porsche to bump up the Cayman power to 911 levels. Secondly the lack of power was always the biggest complaint about the twins, and they haven't addressed that til now, and that was more with a powerband improvement than a big power bump. Personally I think Toyota killed it with this car, it looks great and we all know it's a great starter, build-as-you-go track car. And possibly the end of an era before we see 4000lb plus ev's masquerading as track cars."
"I think you should rank your requirements—especially functional ones versus aesthetic ones—as it’ll help a lot in your search.

The facts are that the industry in general is favouring larger grilles, sleeker rooflines, and is moving from sedans to CUVs as the default family car. 

So while I appreciate that you prefer a more squarish sedan, you need to rank that preference above and below the other stuff—mileage, reliability, space, comfort, driving dynamics, etc.—in order to really suss out what’s most important to you.

For example the 2020 Volkswagen Passat has a squarer trunk and smaller grille than most new-ish sedans, but it’s also an objectively inferior vehicle to the Honda Accord, Mazda 6, or Toyota Camry/Avalon. Each of those have larger grilles and more raked rooflines, but are almost universally recognized as better cars to live with as an owner."

"I'm a very good driver: defensive and attentive. 

However, I failed my first driving test. With our scoring system, you were allowed max 10 points off. I got 14. 

* 5 x 2 pts for right turns where I didn't shoulder check (which is sort of silly in the small town where I took it since there is rarely a need to actually shoulder check, especially on right-hand turns looking for cyclists that you would've seen as you approached them ...)
* 1 x 2 pts for hitting the curb on a parallel park (in my defense, it was a FWD manual and I juiced the throttle a little much and slid on the fresh spring snow)
* 1 x 2 pts for being in neutral too long (I think it was something where I was gearing down to slow down on a left turn off of the highway and an opposing vehicle was turning right; they cancelled their signal right when I was shifting down which meant that I needed to be back in the same gear)

Long story long, we all do it and it really has no bearing on how good we are as drivers in the long run. You're taking a test with minimal driving experience. Picture it this way: by the time you hit 30, less than 7% of your driving experience occurred between ages 15 and 16 (assuming you get 1 year of learner driving prior to taking your test)."

"I was debating calling it 300-350 ish so I would believe that's about the upper end. I just have reference from my own personal engine in the same ballpark. I'm sure the more recent ones can do a little more. Generally I was only thinking stock engine with a supercharger slapped on and maybe a tune because by the time you have enough money for the turbo and engine management you're going to blow past the top end of that horsepower limit and probably be under priced still on the race engine you would need to build to make 500hp in a small engine with a supercharger. 

It could still believe this particular car isn't getting the most out of it, I missed the 222 part. That does sound low."

"But that's what I'm saying, it's just about numbers, it doesn't really matter when you're driving if you can reach 60 mph in 2nd gear or not.

I don't necessarily disagree with you, I was saying for years that they ought to have a trim level of the twins that came with better tires, if only to consistently beat the ND at the track in the magazine tests.  They eventually put the Michelins in a sport package in the later model years, and now the Limited trim of the 2022 car will have them as well."

"Thats difficult and at this point I'm not sure. I absolutely want the natural two tone tan interior and the limited dark green matte colour Cadillac is offering looks great and would go very well with the interior(but it costs 4k). 

I also love bright colours and they do offer the same bright blue that the C8 has, however I don't think that colour works very well on the CT5. I think my options are limited with the tan interior, I might go for for the Wave Metallic blue as that would work nicely but I've had so many blue car's I kind of want to go a different route. Maybe the orange? Rift metallic would be a safe bet or the Infrared but I don't really like dark reds. I think I may bite the bullet on the Emerald Frost Matte paint if its still available or flip a coin on Orange vs Wave Metallic Blue

Who knows."

"I truly believe that the Veloster N will become a cult classic and appreciate in value over time. Maybe not appreciate back to MSRP or go over, but I could definitely see them hanging out around $20-25k once people realize how great of a car they are. It will depreciate like a rock and maybe hang out there for 5-10 years, but I bet after that it’ll start climbing. It will get nowhere near the CTR though. The N brand doesn’t have the historical significance behind it like the Type-R badge does.

For the record, if I did purchase the VN, believing that it would be an investment would not be a reason. I’m not *that* dumb."
The recent Bolt recall should make it clear to legacy auto that batteries are not at all simple. A battery pack is not like a gas tank. EV motors are where the simplicity lies. All the complexity and challenge is in the battery module. The battery supply issue and the *quality* of the battery packs will make-or-break legacy companies. Rush production and QA too fast and run the risk that you've built a bunch of potential fires and a complete recall. Do it too slow and careful and you're not competitive.

"There's a not insignificant chance that they've got a new MR sports car coming.

They've been running a series of prototypes with this sort of tech for years now, under an RM moniker, and they've reportedly used their partnership with Rimac to develop the electric version. Whether Hyundai pulls the trigger and actually launches the car is another matter, but they've been testing the design for a while."

"My mom just bought a Bronco Sport Badlands yesterday. It is their first domestic vehicle in the last 30+ years:

Car history:

* 
Volvo 240 wagon

* 
Volvo 740 sedan

* 
BMW E38 Sport Shorty

* 
1st gen Toyota Sequoia

* 
Lexus LS430

* 
Toyota 4Runner

* 
Lexus LS460 x2

She wanted something to replace the 4 Runner given it is at near 200k miles, and is used to the look, visibility, and seating position of boxier body on frame SUVs having driven that and the Sequoia for 20 years.  However, they are getting older, so she wanted something easier to get into and they have downsized to a place in the city, where the maximum length that can fit in their garage is about 185"".

They also go to the beach frequently and want better gas mileage and driver assist features for that trip, and the ability to occasionally take it offroading in the sand while there.

Especially when considering the length requirement,  I basically said you should probably just get a RAV4 prime or a CX-5 or something, and somewhat ignore the modest off-road requirements... But she really preferred the overall package of the Bronco Sport.

Ford really has something in my opinion in these tiny, unibody, tough looking cars with good on road manners and low starting prices.  The Bronco Sport and the Maverick are going to dominate high school parking lots in affluent suburbs for a decade to come in my opinion, and win over some more affluent older consumers like my parents, downsizing as they age."

"That's exactly it. Both models are built on the Fiesta/global B-car platform, but the EcoSport was engineered specifically for the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) and other ""developing markets"". So it's cheaper to build, but less refined. I should note that this sort of thing is very common among brands--look at any car brand, and chances are they'll have between 3 and 6 crossovers in the subcompact-to-compact range, all for different markets and price ranges.

Looks-wise, the newer Puma is also better IMO. The EcoSport looks like a previous-gen Escape that got squished front-to-back. Judging from reviews of the Puma, it seems that that would be a nicer model to bring to the US, but it would probably cost too much to import vs. the Indian-built EcoSport. One thing I do like about the EcoSport is the higher ground clearance (7.8"" vs. 6.3""), and the available rear-mounted full-size spare tire, even though that's dead weight for most drivers."

"Branding has been a huge issue on their end. I own a 21’ Veloster N DCT, it was hell to acquire. Every dealership I went to, they wanted $40k+. Why? Don’t be Kia, guys. “It’s the one of three in the state. You won’t see a deal like this.” Saw five more that day. Luckily, I found a good dealership and got it for MSRP. I like hanging around there, talking to the techs, asking questions. They’re confused on the branding too. 

I asked “hey, do you guys have any idea when you’re getting an Elantra N?  

“Yeah we have one on the lot!”

They proceeded to bring me to an Elantra N-Line. We got to talking, they expressed their problems with the fact that Hyundai came out of the gate by calling the VN the Veloster N-Line, the hastily changed the name when they came out with a fleet of N-Line cars spanning across their different models. 

“Oh but hold on, we have a Kona N coming in later today.” It wasn’t, it was the Kona N-Line. 

Here’s my issue, and this is more of a problem with Genesis, but their dealerships are not set up to sell performance cars, or cars that MSRP above $50k. Nobody wants to buy a showroom GV80 sitting next to a 2012 Elantra with 140k miles. Nobody wants to wait in the service room for their $70k car with a poor paint job and ripped chairs. I’m sure there are dealerships that incorporate a Genesis section, but as it is right now, most I’ve been to have been Hyundai dealerships, that also sell Genesis. It’s not just a problem with their Genesis integration though. Multiple times Hyundai techs have mistaken my car with the turbo, or even the base model. There’s no information about these N cars coming into sale’s hands, besides “it’s got red accents!” 

The dealership network desperately needs an improvement. As Hyundai cars are improving, their environment isn’t. They need a special N sales team, and to segment their dealership by Hyundai and Genesis."
Did you hope for it to be sporty when you bought it? Why would you drift a genesis sedan?
"If its the white Supra I think you're referencing, it wasn't just tires and a tune and hardly a repeatable time. It had a stripped interior and exhaust removed, then added a downpipe, drag radials and tuned it on race gas. Still, it took a lot of attempts to barely edge into the 10's. With mods, tuning and street worthy tires, its more of a mid 11 second car."

"Congrats on taking advantage of the current crazy state of the market and congrats on the CTR! 

I also have a '19 CTR and the rev hang definitely sucks sometimes but you'll get used to it. I ended up disabling it with Hondata. I love how forgiving it is especially around corners. You'll notice a huge difference in traction and ride quality if you decide to throw some PS4's on it. I know you said you won't have the car long, but I'd also recommend getting lighter wheels as the stocks are heavy at 29lbs each. I also hated being so paranoid of every tiny pothole with my stock wheels.

Since you said smoking on the job: the trade-in scavenging turned into a game for us. Every time one came in, me, the porters, a few of the techs, and the wash guys would all go on a cigarette (the regular nicotine kind) break while the wash guys rifled through the car looking for goodies. Drugs usually went to the wash guys since they were minimum wage and couldn't afford their own, cash was usually split between anyone who showed up to smoke."

"Congrats on the CTR! 

For me, the CTR is one of those cars that I really like the idea of and I love to see them around. However, I don't feel like its something I could get myself to spend my money on. I really like the C8 and its on the list of potential cars I'd actually like to buy in the next few years once the prices relax a bit buuuut I do have a bit of hesitation due to no manual transmission being offered. I feel like eventually I may get a bit bored with the thing without being able to row some gears. 

I spoke to a friend of mine with C7 and C8 experience and he mentioned that the C7 would likely be the better choice for me. Bit more raw, especially on the z06 trim."

"Stupid question, but can I use my car’s spare tire when the other three are different from what my car initially came with?

Edit: the spare tire has also been sitting for the past five and a half years untouched. Should I be concerned with using it given its age?"
"This was in 2019. I left and went back a week later. We started to talk price and they just said - lets bottom line this. I knew 24-25k was a good price for the car. I drove out with it that day.

A week later I thought to myself ""I could have gotten the Autobahn"" but I was so focused on the 35th... Oh well, I loved it for two years and then traded it in when I wanted a change."

"The original was still selling for 90k in the mid 2000s, why would it cost the same or less with inflation 20 years later?"
"Yeah.  If GM can release a much larger, 1,100 HP electric Hummer for $115k, Dodge doing the same for an 80-90k Hellcat replacement is highly reasonable.

I will admit I'd miss the exhaust note, and the intoxicating whine.  However, the most Dodge thing possible would be making their electric engine intentionally be louder."
Stones only end when there are no Stones left. Glad I got to see them all in 2015 and to another show coming this year.
"You'd see it from the front of the vehicle, looking through the grill. Usually on the driver side by the accumulator but it could be anywhere. A few years ago it got so prevalent at my dealer the stock couldn't keep up and got back ordered. The people who Honda wouldn't cover under warranty (before the tab came out for it) actually got their cars back faster because they could get an aftermarket condenser instead of having to use an OEM part for the warranty. It's a slow leak when it happens, and will take a good amount of time before the lack in A/C performance is noticed."
"Cars I think have about hit their limit, any faster and they'll be posting negative 0-60 times, in a sense, going back in time. I think I'll buy a Chiron so I can see my grandmother again, lol"

"Nah, Bill Ward just left the band. A couple of other Sabbath Drummers have bit the dust in the last 40 years though."
This was my introduction to the band as well. What an amazing cover.
"I tried to buy a Veloster N and the dealer refused to even let me see one without committing to purchasing. I should note this was just before the market went crazy - based on my research, I should’ve been able to get one for just under MSRP. I had pretty much sold the car to myself but I refuse to buy a vehicle without a test drive. I conveyed this message to 2 salespeople at my local dealer, yet to this day I’ve not even sat in one. 

If it wasn’t implied, I love what Hyundai is doing with N Performance. I wish I could experience it first hand, but unfortunately, I’m stuck essentially bad mouthing their dealers while positively referencing cars I have no experience with. Here’s my quick opinions on each model that is/will be available:

Veloster N: Add a 4th door and I’d probably buy one without the test drive honestly. However, I recognize that defeats the purpose. Unfortunately I feel the Veloster only has 3 doors to say it has 3 doors; simply to be quirky. I’d also like to see an i30N but… not available in the US.

Kona N: Will be dead on arrival. The lack of AWD was a huge mistake by Hyundai especially when AWD will be available on lower trims. Trust me, I *recognize* the reasoning for not offering AWD, but it is a huge mistake given the assumed target audience. A lack of a manual also makes me upset but I’m a manual nerd and I recognize that, so oh well. 

Elantra N: Will be a primary factor as to why the Kona N will be DOA. It looks like it’ll practically be a FWD WRX with more tech. I hope to see a lot of these on the roads but I genuinely worry given a lot of peoples experience with Hyundai dealers. 

Like you, I hope for their success, but we’ll see how the future treats them."

"Maybe that's what is.  Pop has been so mellow the last year and so hearing something upbeat with an edge stands out.  

I guess the basis for my wondering where she came from, is that the local MN radio was playing Brutal for the last couple months, but then realizing that the national pop station was also playing her music too, ...well it's not often that happens."
"Their time has passed but they will go down in history as one of the greatest rock n roll bands ever.  So, really, they will never end.  They will go on forever."
Yeah when i looked at the numbers i wasn't as upset either
Just.... all of them. As long as we're wishing.
"PSHHH no offense I was debating whether you should fix the brake lines n run it for a few, but a damn lumina?? Ur lucky that things still driving. I personally have horror stories with their reliability. Sell it while it works and tell them about the rust.

"> Their point is that Ford knows the Lightning will be super popular. 

No, his point was that Ford cannot catch Tesla because their single vehicle has a lower capacity than two of Tesla’s combined.  He made a bad faith argument, and I responded in kind.

Regarding your comments on Lightning production estimates, see my [other response](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/pa858g/ford_increasing_lightning_production_due_to/ha3kn1z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) to his post.  80k annual is not a number Ford settled on because they’re happy with it - that is the upper limit of what they’re confident they’ll have the batteries for.

> Tesla is forecasting 0 Cybertrucks in 2024? 

Am I supposed to interpret the total lack of updates post-reveal, and the absence of a firm launch date even as the tentative one slips by, as anything else?  Even the one-man-PR-department won’t commit to a sales or production figure prediction, despite having no qualms about doing so for other models."
"Shouldn't be an issue if you're good at palming the shifter and letting the centering springs do the work guiding you into gears.

Still not super common, but probably significantly more likely to occur if you death grip the shifter and try to forcibly tell it which gear you want."

"I don't get people complaining about this being a car for ""badge snobs"". Literally, just compare any \~35k crossover with this and you'll find this much more premium. Of course this isn't as good as your 70k e class, but it's a very competitive product in its class."

"> Sure, but it isnt a muscle car

Except that no one can or will ever agree on what a ""muscle car"" is vs. a ""pony car"" etc. Its been a hot debate since the 60's when a clever suit coined the term. One thing I have never seen, is the rule that a muscle car HAS to be gas powered.

Speaking of words meaning things, here is a couple of words for you, opinions and facts. 

You disparage people here for not knowing the difference, but you roll out your opinions and present them as facts.

 Maybe you should examine the meaning of these words, instead of declaring Dodge is dead and that electric cars cant possibly have any character? Just a thought."

"> Could you do a R-1 shift while it's still rolling backwards pretty quick to trash the transmission though?

Not in a manual. I don't know about automatics, but I've put a manual in 1st gear while the car was still going backward. In one gymkhana in the Miata there was a V path, first reverse, then forward. I was still going about 20 mph in reverse when I put in the clutch, moved the shift lever to 1st, revved up the motor, and popped the clutch. The rear tires obediently spun. There were no engine, transmission, or any other mechanical problems. Buuuuut... With the front tires rotating backward at 20 mph and the rear tires spinning forward at 5,000 rpm (about 23 mph), the computer decided the ABS sensors must be giving false info and disabled ABS. I got the car headed forward, crossed the finish, then hit the brakes. With all four tires rotating the same direction at the same speed, the computer was happy and reenabled ABS. So no permanent issues and only a short term ABS/computer error."

"It's like how a good personality can make anyone 1-2 points more attractive, a manual can make a fairly boring car more engaging.

I had a Camry that was pretty ok, mainly because of it's 5 speed, and that was helped because it was geared so high as to make it quiet and efficient on the highway.

The volvos I had had good nice transmissions felt solid and the gears where were you wanted them albeit a bit short.     They were boring, including the transmission, but it was part of the whole package.    It was more fun to have that ""slow car fast"" thing with the ""eurpean sports car"" feel with a manual in an otherwise big boring car.  

I had an F150 that had a 300-6   that was made even better by what was effectively a 3 speed manual.  (granny 1st)  Gobs of torque meant gear selection didn't matter which was good because there wasn't much selection.  It'd have been boring with an auto though.  The manual made me feel like I was some tough guy truck driver.  

I had a chevy truck with an auto, but that was ok because it was well behaved for an auto.   The auto went along with the general plush nature of the truck and the little v8 was ok running the torque converter.   That was about the only auto I've had that didn't make me wish for a manual.


I wonder if it's not as much about the transmission making the car good, as a bad transmission can make the car bad.   

My Caravan would have been a dandy car, but the slushy transmission detracted from it.      

The 80's Hondas I had were good, in spite of the transmissions being akin to stirring rocks with spaghetti noodles.


I had a Spitfire that was hampered by a crappy transmission.  It'd grind if you shifted it too fast, so you had to shift slowly and deliberately.   Coupled with <50hp that needed to be shifted a lot, made it so it looked more like a sports car than it was.    The MG I drove was similar."

"Financing with interest isn’t “losing money” if you have money invested. 

If you put 10k in an investment earning 7% annually and got a loan for 10k for 3 years @ 5% you would make 2% off that loan in the first year. Then because of compound interest you would make even more money the 2nd and 3rd years. 

So say you finance a $25k car at 3% for 4 years. Invest that money you have into an index and make over 4% a year for those 4 years. 

The lower the interest rate the more money you profit but as long as you get a loan for less than you make off an investment you come out ahead. I have averaged around 10% on my investment over the last 5 years. 

Now on to your next point. You can still get a loan to buy privately. Go to a few different banks and give them the info on the car you want to buy and they’ll approve you for a loan. Just like if you went to a dealer. Explain to them you’re buying privately and they’ll explain what you need to do. 

If you’re parents want to put in some money great. I would try to explain to them that giving you the money to invest would be a better use of the money and helping you pick out a good car and getting a low interest rate on a loan you can afford would be more beneficial for you long term. 

Paying cash for a car is just poor use of money. In 7 years your $25k would be worth at least $50k. In years that $8k car will probably be worth $4k."

Hyundai's design head, Luc Donckerwolke, worked for VW group for a long time and designed the Lambo Murcielago and the current Bentley Continental GT among other cars. So Hyundai/Kia are finally coming out with attractive vehicles that aren't just copies of other cars or anonymous blobs. Combined with their reasonable MSRP and good feature lists, it's a winning combination for sales. The markups are ridiculous but the design really draws in average buyers. The telluride is very popular with suburban moms."

Basically you’ll be fine if you’re thinking about what you’re doing. Almost all money shifts happen when people are drag racing or trying to really aggressively do a pull. My thing is that if you have the manual, you’re there for feel over speed anyway. Why not just take your time with your shifts and enjoy them?"

Applaud BMW for not baking in understeer.
I had a 19 Si and could not drive that car smoothly for the life of me. The clutch felt like nothing and trying to rev match was impossible because the same throttle input would give wildly different results. The last manual I drove before it was my 04 Mach 1 Mustang and it was definitely a night and day difference compared to the civic.

I did hear one with an aftermarket exhaust that sounded really great.  I was shocked at how good it was.
They looked modern in 2014 but the minimal changes compared to other cars made it look outdated very quick
"Yup.

I can trade my nearly 2-year old truck into several places for up to $5k over what I paid, let alone the 20 months of payments.  And I'd do it, but the pickings are very skimpy, so I'd have to custom order and wait 2-3 months.

I imagine the OP may have done even better with a harder to find C8."
"no rear climate controls, no alcantara headliner, no full leather on every surface, no rear wheel steering, no HUD augmented reality navigation. That dealership really stuck doug with their base model benz"

"I dailied a 350z for 12 years, for the past 4 or 5 years of that, I switched to a square setup and the traction control didn’t like that, so it was off with the TCS the minute I turned on the vehicle. It never once did anything evil. Rear popped out once in the rain unexpectedly when I was being kind of an ass, but it’s sooooo easy to catch oversteer in that car. Every other time the rear came around it was because that was my intention. I’m not gods gift to driving, that car is just easy to control if you’re any good whatsoever.

Unfortunately, there are lots of people who are just no good whatsoever at driving."

">let alone a CUV. They said it brings awareness and excitement to that buyer demographic. Now I maybe nuts but who goes into a Hyundai dealership and goes OMG I have to have have a Nurburgring tuned Kona.

There is no doubt that the CUV market is so hot right now (and this likely will continue for many years). It makes much more sense to focus on a fast, ""sporty"" CUV than a dismal hatchback that is clinging to the showroom floor by it's life support wires. 

The image of ""sportiness"" sells in the CUV market. At the very least it gets people into the doors. ""Ooooh, that's the really fast SUV that I heard about!"". This is the type of reaction that Hyundai is *planning* to get from the market. 

And personally, I would enjoy having a performance CUV especially one on the smaller end of the spectrum. While the tepid versions of the Macan/GLC/Q5 are appealing, I don't *need* something that big (granted that the Kona is, as far as I remember, literally the same size as a Golf). 

In the end I can see why Hyundai would focus on the hot market rather than the dying one."

The first thing that comes to mind for me (if you don't want a manual) is the Dodge Charger, either base model or Scat Pack. You get more horsepower per dollar than most other cars on the market rn, and they don't break the bank new or used.   


A Subaru WRX might be what you want. I love the manual but I've heard great things about the CVT and it's often hailed as a very ""fun"" car to drive even if it isn't the most over the top in terms of horsepower. My guess is that if you did get this one you will also want to purchase a new or used Accessport and do a Stage 0 tune(stock) which reduces rev hang, ups the horses a little, and generally tends to wake the car up a bit.

Group A: H/K is the brand that makes those cheap looking cars, the ones with the beige exterior and cheap cloth interior. The image of the cars are ripped seats, broken AC, sun faded knobs. Because that’s all they’ve seen of the cars when they took their first glance at them. The H/N’s of today are unrecognizable, for that image is engraved in their minds. 

Group B: they’re surprised. When H/K came out of the gate with the Telluride, redesigned Santa Fe, Hyundai N, they all did a spit take. Wow, the Elantra looks… good now? Myself, I even considered trading in my Veloster N for the upcoming Elantra N. A lot of Group B is buying these cars now. Every other car is a K5, every other car is a sonata or Elantra. Every other car is a Tuscon. I can be walking along the street, immediately look to the left and see 4 H/K cars. 

Their dealerships, for the most part, suck. Like I’ve said, they don’t know what they’re selling, and they’re not set up to sell upmarket items. The communication doesn’t seem to be there. Kia failed to tell dealerships not to markup the Stinger by $30k, and they lost it. Hyundai forgets, or fails to tell sales what the N brand actually is. 

I remember hearing from my dealership “why don’t you trade your VN in for a Sonata N-Line?”

I'll agree that that the driving dynamics  from the better suspension and LSD are not necessarily things a commuter would notice. So it really comes down to whether getting a noticably faster car that looks better (subjectively) with nearly no drawback to fuel economy is worth the premium.

"> I think at least cars aimed at enthusiasts (like the 86) should definitely have more interesting colors inside at least.

I agree.  I did some research and you can get 18 different interior options in a Cayman currently amongst the various colors/leathers/sport seats.  It's 32 in a base 911.  Say what you will about Porsche option costs, but the volume of options is awesome.  Heck, there are 16 different versions for an M3.   

Obviously it would be insane to expect that kind of variety with a car that is literally half the cost at best, but I'd think they'd be able to swing at least one alternative.  Expecially so when they've already got the materials elsewhere in the lineup.  Red floors in a different region as shown above, or the Camry can be optioned with red leather in the US if they'd rather go the seat direction instead of floors.  You already have the physical design done, and have apparently been able to source the materials based on other models/regions... seems like the hardest work has been done already.  Personally, I'd love to see a light gray interior (a la Rav4/Camry) to be optioned with the Trueno Blue already planned for the 86."
I think that’s actually what will happen with this car. No way it stays at $35k. Prices will crash by the end of the model year.

I'm being sarcastic--note my flair. It's more controversial to *like* crossovers on /r/cars than to dislike them.
Anybody in or around ATL knows it’s G37/Altima’s or E46/E90 3 series. Literally 10 minutes ago I saw a Blacked out E90 Sedan doing donuts at a park during kids baseball practice.
Isn't the new BlackWing an LS?
They really lost a lot of what made them special musically when the Rev died. I still like their music it just doesn’t have the same flavor anymore.
My girlfriend is super stoked to get one. I'm excited to check it out. Hopefully Ford doesn't bungle the launch like they've done a few times recently.
"First, it increases the cost of the car unnecessarily. Second, the 964 uses a derivation of the G50, so it’s not that big a step backward.

The G50’s a good transmission, but so is the 915."

No it really isnt, it's a YOU thing. Over 40, loved muscle cars my entire life and I have no qualms about Dodge evolving and pushing the boundaries of automotive evolution."
"My problem is that between Load and Reload there's maybe 1 album worth of good songs, definitely not two.

"I won't be tuning out the revhang, I'll just live with it since the car won't be around for more then 12 months most likely and I won't really be putting a ton of miles on it.

However My AC is being finicky but I didn't notice that it made a difference if it was on or off with the revhang, still did it."

What's the public consensus on Hyundai/Kia like these days in the States? In NZ and Aus they're a top tier brand in terms of sales and reputation - essentially seen by the public as Toyota but better value. When Americans think of Hyundai/Kia do they still imagine cars like the shitty Kia Spectra on Doug Demuro's channel a few years back? And are the dealerships a noticeable step down from the Japanese and US brands?

"If your purposefully buy a worse version of a car, then it sure doesn't seem like they care about the car all that much"
Caught him live in a tiny venue in Manchester (UK) on his tour for A Sailor's Guide to Earth. Incredible show. He lost me a little with Sound & Fury but Tyler Childers has kept me going until Sturg went back to his roots :)
Your C8 was my type Rs colour hahaha. If I had the money I'd get that colour for sure.
">The old style ranger I would call small.

So it's a good thing this is effectively the same size.

I do not, but if I did, what difference would it make? Personal attacks aren't helping your argument."
I put 93 in my M5 and 87 in the Tacoma.  Don't see myself getting rid of either vehicle anytime soon either (plan on keeping the M5 forever).
"I'm always amazed at how little research people do ahead of time, or what certain factors play into what car people buy. I mean, besides mortgage/rent, car payment(s) can be the 2nd or 3rd highest expense in a household. 

Had a friend buy a new car a couple weeks ago, it was a random Saturday and more or less a random ""I think I'll get a new car today"" situation. Her crossover was old, and she talked about a GLA or a CX-5, compact crossover stuff. She ended up buying a VW Tiguan, which is fine. When I asked her why the Tiguan over whatever else, she said they drove through parking lots to see which crossovers she liked the look of and she just liked how the Tiguan looked, so that's what they got...

We in /r/cars can be so focused on specifics of vehicles, which one is ""best"" in whatever category you might be looking at... meanwhile people are out there buying $40,000 vehicles based on parking lot drive-thrus."
"It seems like they were good cars but were marked up so much that you might as well buy something much better. As a result, only a few real enthusiasts got them."
"she has, this persons just bitter and can’t use search engine"
I’m on a list at one of the big dealerships for a C8. My guy says it will be about 2-3 months from here til it’s time to order. Been thinking that a CT5 Blackwing might actually be my play.
"First thing first, situation matters. If you make 6 figures, but you live in Silicon Valley, Manhattan, a nice part of the DC metro area, then stack a few kids and maybe a partner than isn't making much, then you aren't making a lot. But if you are making 6 figures, are single, live in rural America or with your parents, then you have a lot more expendable income. 

With that said, the other poster was right. About 30% - 50% of salary is generally reasonable. If you have more to spend, it's probably best to not put it into an asset that depreciates that much. 

And I can sympothize on car prices. I make right over the 6 figure mark and was living in a high cost of living location and felt like it was an extreme stretch to get a  top trim Stinger. There were some big discounts, so it was about 40%-ish of my income. My justification was that I love cars and have always got an ultra practical base model of anything I drove for like a decade. So it was the one time I spent money on a fun car. It's great, but a Camry would have also been fine."
This album was phenomenal
"All the modern 5 - 9 speed automatic transmissions attached to base 4 cylinders. 

The old 3 and even 4 speed transmissions were the origin of the slushbox moniker, take 15 - 20% of the power out of a 100 hp engine and you were left with a glorified lawn mower.

Modern computer controlled transmissions may not be perfect but they are one of the big reasons manuals are in decline."
Decades? My penny farthing takes offense good sir.
"I only discovered them 3 years ago and went through that same question. They mustn't have been that big otherwise we would have known about them earlier. Since then, October Rust has become one of my favorite albums ever and I listen to it probably every week. I've been discovering a lot of great bands from the 90s in recent years. From the top of my head, other amazing bands that never got enough recognition are HUM, Failure, and Monster Magnet."
"Yeah, on this side of the Atlantic it's Golf GTIs, Audi A3s, and 10-15 y.o. BMW 3-series."
"A lot of the popular swaps have kits you can buy to reduce the amount of required fabrication. A Miata would probably be a lot but I think cars with more engine bay room would be a lot easier to work with. Also, not doing a turbo would simplify it too."

"I said the same lower down, at 35k you are hard pressed to find a better option in the same class/category/AWD.   Call it badge-bait or whatever you want, but compared to a Ford Edge etc this just feels better and drives better. Reviews says pretty much the same."

"I know i kid who bought a rebuilt title G37 coupe with 170k miles, dumped probably 3k in mods including a tune, and then blew the motor....... and then spent 5k having a fresh motor put in. Mind you the car is probably worth 5k fixed."

But to say Mazda haven’t delivered on the tech you mentioned is just wrong
"Obviously it is easier for conservatives.  We are awash in great music from lefties.  While some of the messages are tedious, and most of the lifestyle choices nearly the opposite of what we hope for our children, I listen to them anyways.  Since fewer musicians are conservative, and only a minority of those would admit it publicly due to the backlash, a leftie can exercise their bias by avoiding the few right wingers who are out of the closet without a substantial loss."
"I remember at the time they got the nickname ""Nirvana in Pajamas"""

"It's the perfect car for a huge chunk of the market. It'll probably cost less to own than a gas or maybe even a hybrid SUV. The cost of charging up is so small in comparison to gas that there's not really a ""big car"" penalty. It has the locking frunk so you can go to to multiple stores on weekends without leaving stuff open in the bed. It obviously does have the bed for the rare occasion you need to move a large item. It'll be a boon to fleets that run around town during the day and can charge all night. The only use cases it's not ideal for is if you regularly travel beyond its range (including if you tow a camper or boat) or if your fleet runs around the clock."
"When it comes out. Right now, the numbers are hypothetical. I'm not doubting Elon because this mother fucker put his money where his mouth was. The Plaid is insane. I would do unimaginable things to be able to launch one. I bet he'll pull his crazy launch figures out of his ass somehow. But Elon takes forever to release cars and I'm still waiting to see an independent test launch."
"in 6 years i've never had to re-align the gears in my mk7 GTI except for the few times i disconnected the linkages to do some work. If you find yourself having to re-adjust your gear shifter, without having touched any of the linkages, then something is wrong."

" lm excited for the Kona N because it's the ultimate compromise in a way that fits into my life. My wife strongly prefers to drive a suv/cuv, so instead of getting a boring Rav4 to share as our daily we can get the Kona N. She gets the form factor she wants and I can drive the car without falling asleep. And I'll keep the impractical rwd coupe as the weekend car.

The only other vehicle I can think that fits that niche is the Porsche Macan which is way better but also easily double the price. Anyone have other suggestions that won't break the bank?

Also /u/savagegeese has the best YT channel of all time. Pls revamp patreon so I can vomit more money at you."
"Damn shame Peter didn't become as big as Cobain, Cornell or Layne Staley. He had a pretty good singing voice for sure. The song ""Nettie"" gives you a good idea of how good of a voice he had. Also, regarding the goth chick shit, I did kind of notice that in the r/typeonegative subreddit. There were a few posts of goth chicks wearing chokers and Peter Steele t-shirts."
"I don't know if 'overhyped' is the right term to use in this specific instance, given the massive divide over the car before its release. I guess it would be 'polarised'?

"Hahah, both are outliers but I didn’t want to go with the most popular song."
"It is just power supply and heat management after all. 

Plenty of scope for better cooling and power supply to motors, and all the mechanical handling tuning options are the exact same.

The major issue is that demanding too much out of a fuel system just causes the engine to stop - pulling more power out of a lithium battery than it is rated for usually ends in an explosion."

Much happier with the Z06, and I picked up a 500 Abarth for daily duties. The Z06 and Abarth combined are less than what the Civic costed lol."

Insane car but Carbahn doesn't even list numbers with 91 octane."
That immediately rang in my head before I even got to your comment. Well done!
"Maybe a dumb question but, what makes a manual feel great? Only ever driven the car I have now"
"Huh, the 300 has front and rear locking discs, and the front suspension is double-wishbone of all things (rear is multilink). Plus a ZF 8-speed. It ain't quick, but it actually seems like a decent ""budget"" alternative to the Wrangler or Bronco.

The Leapmotor should've been a knock-off IDX. The liftback shape does not do its design any favours.

Why did L&C/Geey make another brand that looks exactly like L&C cars? I don't understand its positioning in Geely's brand structure. It's a cool EV sports wagon though.

MG has been advertising their low-cost race models in the UK for a while now. Now might be a ripe opportunity to test the waters in outside markets (like Australia) with the 6 X-Power. I didn't know that it was a hybrid.

Very interesting overall. I'd probably still stick with Japanese or even SK brands for a variety of reasons, but Chinese cars have come a long way. I'd go for something Geely/Volvo-based if I had to get a Chinese car."
"The current TE1 platform uses third-party IP.  That means royalties on using batteries and motors, and having a supply chain at the mercy of a third party.  We’re seeing the limitations of that approach right now.

The TE2 architecture is going to use Ford-developed battery and electric motor tech.  It will be through a joint venture with SK, but Ford is still joint holder of the IP, so they can pocket more of the proceeds from Lightning sales.  Having more control over the process also means Ford can force the establishment of dedicated BlueOvalSK factories for TE2 batteries, eliminating the current bottleneck."
Wonder how much it costed to do it that way.

"Definitely. For a band like the Rolling Stones, who have been playing since before my father was born lol, you have to have someone who can keep it afloat, not in a talent way (not to say they were lacking it!), but more in a ""big brother"" figure type of way.

Charlie Watts was that guy. That quiet cornerstone that kept the Stones Rolling. May he Rest with the great ones up there!"
"I would definitely draw the line at an openly white supremacist band like Skrewdriver. Everything else, it kinda depends... Canceling Eric Clapton for something he allegedly said, while coked out of his mind, four decades ago, feels like an overreaction to me. And Morrissey didn't really say anything worse than any of my conservative family members. If I continue to hang out with them, it would be hypocritical of me to stop listening to The Smiths. 

I really cannot think of any mainstream artist I wouldn't want to listen to because of their personal opinions. Kanye or Ted Nugent... I just don't like their music."

"I don’t think it started that way.  There were many great bands and great albums.  But by 1988, 1989, it got homogenized and became self-parody.  But I’ll still rock out out to Motley Crue, Skid Row, Guns, Warrant, etc once in a while."
Yeah also I want one with an extended or regular cab and an actual usable 6-8 foot bed. They should have just had a two front door version.
It'd be more likely to be 6>2.
"Hell, last year I bought a Tesla Model 3 with 280 horses to the rear wheels, 220 miles of range, and 3.5x faster charging speeds than this thing for $35k. Mazda phoned this one in big time."
"Part of the problem, once you have >3 kids you have to ferry around... your choice of vehicles is cut WAY WAY down. to like 1/8th of available cars on the market, maybe lower. and While I personally don't buy new cars, used cars that carry large numbers of people are often BEAT when they are used. People tent to buy them and then use the ever living daylights out of them. so buying a used one isn't always a great deal. So these dealers have a pretty captive audience on this type of vehicle."
Might as well. It already looks remarkably like a Mustang from the side.
"I legitimately know a person who probably didn't buy a Hellcat because he was loudly talking about how much he wanted a ""scat pack"" in the break room, and someone thought he was talking about porn.  He became the ""scat man"" from that day until the day he left.  People would leave fake dog shit on his desk.  I felt bad for the dude, but christ, what were they thinking?"

I remember getting a boom box that had 2 tape decks and a CD player for Xmas one year. My parents bought a double cassette of like Now That's What I call Music having mistaken it for a CD box. My Dad obviously felt bad about me not having a CD for my new CD player and found a petrol station open that sold CDs. He bought the only one he recognised the name of the artist which was UB40 (the album was Promises & Lies) so they were my first ever CD and probably one of the reasons I liked so many different kinds of music.

"The dealership should have full documentation of the maintenance done on the vehicle during those 7000 miles. See if you can look over it and figure out if anything looks funky.

If you're buying CPO, it should include some sort of warranty period where any issues are covered by the manufacturer. If someone didn't drive the car very much because there was a problem, then that problem should resurface while you're under that warranty period, and it'll be covered.

If you're buying used with no warranty or agreement, just have a trusted, local, independent mechanic do a pre-purchase inspection on the vehicle first.

The bottom line is that fewer miles are generally better, and some people just don't drive as much as they expected. If there was a problem that caused someone not to drive the car very much, I doubt they would have just kept it for two years and not documented anything. But if something feels funky, passing on it isn't a bad idea. Chances are it's not the one and only deal for you."
"Came in to say this. I am falling in love with the Maverick but I'm going to have to give up a manual transmission if I get one. I still hopefully have more years with my manual Fit so I'm going to enjoy it while I can.

"If the Stones had a more outgoing drummer that was up to the same stuff that Keith and Mick were up to, that band would have most likely imploded a long time ago.

"Money shift is when you downshift at redline. This causes the engine to fuck right off, indicating an expensive repair. Hence the loss of money in the shift."
"Having considered K-swapping my civic, I have a plan if I do decide to bite the bullet and can't justify to myself spending the 2.5-3k on everything I'd need at once. First I plan on getting the components that have the longest warranties, and gradually work my way down until I'm at the stage where the parts left are the engine and transmission, and then once purchasing those beginning work on them, since most junkyards only have a period of 30 days to verify that the component bought is functional, if not shorter. The most expensive parts for my particular k-swap from what I could gather would be the mounts, engine, and transmission(also your choice of source for the drivetrain can make a huge impact, since buying a reman engine and transmission is significantly more expensive than pulling one out of a rear ended car that had it already), with the mounts costing 500 dollars for the set. So while the actual assembly of the final project might be done over the course of a week, you can prepare for that stage over a much longer period of time."

Ringo and Charlie are the kind of drummers you want in your band if you don't want everybody to be listening to the drummer the whole time. They just blend into the background and make everyone else sound great. Drummers like that are worth their weight in gold.

"You should push the clutch pedal in all the way for every shift. 

Not pushing the clutch pedal all the way in can lead to excess clutch wear (the clutch friction surface can keep slipping on the flywheel) and weird behaviors on shifting. I've helped out a lot of folks who reported grinding when they shift. When I drive their car there's no grinding. I tell them to move their seat 1 click further forward and push the clutch pedal down *hard* for every shift, and the grinding is gone. They weren't pushing the clutch pedal down far enough and the drivetrain wasn't entirely disconnecting.

Avoid moneyshifts by not skipping lots of gears, particularly if downshifting from high RPM."
"I found a gram or two of coke in a Ranger I'd just bought when I was about 17. I was cleaning it out in one of the bays of the quick-lube place I worked at, so I handed it to a greasy skid I worked with and told him I didn't want anything to do with it. Later that night he went and did it in the bathroom with a couple girls he hung out with who were *definitely* 2 or 3 years younger than us.

Greasiest fucking thing I've ever seen."

"I mean, shit. By the 0-60 comparison logic, half the crossovers I see on the road could smoke me. Even the latest RAV4s are no slouch, especially if you get the hybrid models. (See: drag race comparisons between Camry V6 and RAV4 Hybrid.)

These acceleration tests are meaningless so long as the car isn’t dogshite slow. The CX-9 in our garage accelerates slightly faster from a stop, but it’s not more fun to drive than my slower Mazda3 whatsoever."
I like the song.
"[A harsh Michigan winter prevented us from fully retesting the BRZ at 40,000 miles, but a truncated excursion to a warmer location yielded slightly slower zero-to-60 (6.7 seconds) and quarter-mile (15.1 at 95 mph) times, likely due to worn-out tires and a lower-friction surface at our second test venue. Lateral grip on the skidpad dropped to 0.83 g. But given the car’s slightly improved acceleration to 100 mph (16.7 ­seconds versus 16.9 when new) and its stronger rolling-start performance, we’d expect our broken-in test car to be quicker out of the hole with a fresh set of rubber.](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15111600/2013-subaru-brz-long-term-test-wrap-up-review/)

"but here's the thing...those ""artists"" are mired in mediocrity.  KISS is not mired, they actually get worse every year.  They were a 70's pseudo-rock gimmick.  The gimmick does not age well and if you just listen to the music it's awful.   The production is bad, the mixing is wretched.  There's no good aspect to a KISS album.  Unless you're 10 and you think dudes in cat makeup is super sweet or something.  KISS will be worse a year from now then they are currently and even worse the further into the future you consider them.  Bolton, Kenny G, sure...it's bad.  But it won't continue to decay and mold the way KISS does."
"When I got it was awesome. But over the years I’ve noticed nuances that solidify it not being a performance car. The tranny is not sport tuned despite the marketing. It shifts quickly but just not as you would want. It can drift around a corner well but the suspension is slightly tuned so it’s still a bit of boat. It’s fast for sure. But its 2010 fast. It can still outrun a charger rt w a 5.7 (my buddy has a 2016 and I pull every time) and it can keep up w a mustang and a m3 for its time.  But its just not a performance car. No vents. No paddle shifters. No big brakes. Nothing performance oriented. The motor is tuned like an old

"You can do ~450WHP with that supercharger, with a built engine of course. JR said they had a time attack car putting down 500whp. He is only making 222whp which is quite low and isn't much more than FBO which explains the 0-60 time. That supercharger is easily capable of much more. The upper end of what people achieve with a supercharger is 350whp since anything more than that is on borrowed time without a built engine. 

edit: ~300whp e85 is about the most most people seem to run since 350whp is flirting with danger."

"What they do in their personal life is private, even if they make their opinion public it's something that shouldn't influence on your opinion about their music.

"Totally agree. I have almost no need for a 300 mile EV because I have a 2nd ICE car. If I run around town and commute in the EV 100 miles range is more than enough. Now some people absolutely need 300, but I think far fewer than think that they need 300. 

That being said, the issue with the Mazda seems to be that is the same price as EVs with double the range. While I may not need 200 miles often, I’d take it for the same price."

"Heres my personal example. My 5 speed manual 2002 bmw 530 tops out 100 mph in 3rd gear. I was doing this and went to shift into 4th (at 6500 rpm). Well, i hit second by accident. Mathematically, when i dropped the clutch, going 100mph in 2nd gear, the engine hit nearly 13000 rpm. It sounded like a nitro powered rc car (little .28L 2 stoke that tops at 40,000rpm). If you money shift in Forza, the sound is correct.

 I got lucky and my car suffered absolutely no damage. It should have thrown a rod or something doing that. 

Downshifting is intentional. Rev matching is a challenge because it verys by car. Need to know what rpm your shooting for based on the speed youre going and what gear youre going into (how far you press down gas/how long you hold it). For example, to shift from 3 to 2 going 40 mph, youd do a normal shift with the difference of shifting down vs up as well as revving the engine to desired rpm during the shift before clutch is let up. In my 40mph going from 3-2, id need to get it up to like 4000-4500 rpm before dropping the clutch."

"It was really just the price. If you could have gotten one for ~$1,000 which was around the price for an electric bike (adjusting for 20 years inflation) I think it would have been more popular. But it was $3000-5000 which was used car territory."
"As a brand, N doesn't mean anything to me. I haven't watched a Rally since Colin McCrae was alive. What other motorsports N competes in I have no idea. Launching your brand with a car nobody buys - Veloster- is probably a terrible idea. We don't have dealer markups in Canada so they aren't treated like a McLaren. If they made a more expensive, better car than their competitors people still wouldn't buy it, it's still just a Hyundai. They're starting from nothing and you have to start somewhere. 
As a car I love the Veloster N. It's just a fun little car. It'll make you smile every time you drive it. It looks like nothing else. It's also affordable. It's somewhat practical. The interior could be better but whatever. Yes I bought one. Pretty sure savagegeese had a first gen Veloster and so did I. That car was very limited when it came to performance. The Veloster N is everything that the first generation should have been."
"Seriously. My Electric Mini costs 4k less, has 30 more miles of range and has 50 more hp. The value proposition of this just isn't there when you have leaf, ariya, bolt, or mini.

"I rode in a coworker's recent-model Model 3 not too long ago and I'd put his Tesla in the middle between my old ('13) BRZ and my current CTS in terms of interior build quality. 

In the BRZ at highway speeds I couldn't have a conversation with someone in the passenger seat without shouting at them between the wind and tire noise. On the highway in the CTS I was able to talk to someone on the phone using *the phone's speaker (*not bluetooth) in a normal speaking voice. 

Midrange Cadillacs from the previous decade aren't exactly what I'd consider the gold standard for luxury car interior quality, so for Tesla to not hit that bar is a little disappointing. 

I will say the Tesla's seats were amazing."

"There are even [FWD drag cars](https://www.thedrive.com/news/33522/watch-a-1500-hp-honda-civic-hit-60-mph-in-1-1-seconds) that can do 0-60 even faster and not cost anywhere near a million.  It's about being purpose built, and really sticky tires (the kind that are NOT street legal, and the kind Block can use in races and/or demos).

Hyper-cars aren't only about performance.  They also have comfort, reliability (to an extent) and street-legal specifications.  None of those apply to race/demo cars."

"> Ford can actually push midsize truck buyers into a smaller vehicle or convert cuv buyers to the utility of a bed vs covered storage with this.

I suspect that Ford is leaning way more into the latter than the former. I think I've assumed that most of the folks who buy midsized trucks (Ranger, Tacoma, Colorado, Canyon, Frontier... am I missing any?) are more likely to eventually increase size up to a full-sized pickup than go down to a compact pickup. 

I could be super wrong about this, but it feels to me like Ford is pushing this to folks who might be considered a smaller city CUV like the Hyundai Venue, with the bed as a ""just in case"" added utility instead of the primary selling factor. I think they're targeting folks who otherwise don't care about the bragging-rights perspective of truck specs and more-or-less just want the added utility. 

I may be reading too much into it, but I don't think it's a coincidence that so many of the official promotional pictures of the Maverick are of it in a big city or clearly on city roads with tall buildings around."

"I find the new i20N to be the best example of what you are talking about. They really use their WRC commitment in the marketing material for that car. Unfortunately the I20N is FWD with a reused engine they have already put into quite a few other cars. It doesn't even clearly beat the Fiesta ST in the segment so the GR Yaris makes those marketing statements regarding the WRC look like an absolute joke.

It's relatively cheap though so there is the big argument for buying one of those. But like you said that's the wrong way to go. You want to push boundaries and Hyundai hasn't done that all.

Instead they keep reinforcing their image of not being as good as the competition but being way cheaper in return. And their line-up is so safe it's almost criminal. Everything is FWD, most of them use the exact same 4 cylinder engine and other parts, most are hatches and none of them are in segments that are unpopular for the overall car buying demographic but interesting for enthusiasts."

Carrying exhibits to court would be so much easier. (Fun fact, we can fit up to 3 bankers boxes in the S2K: 1 in the trunk, 2 on the passenger seat.)

"First off, what you're looking for is a dying breed so you may end up looking at a hatch or crossover if you're too particular for sedans.

Given your post, though, a lightly used Toyota Avalon would be my choice. Bombproof reliable, huge back seat, and big trunk. The C pillar has a touch of sweep to it, but it also has a proper trunklid and more classic/conservative styling in the side profile versus really swoopy looking sedans.

Way more reliable and easy to maintain as a family car versus a Charger."
No idea tbh
"The era of Mini and BMW in her price range is going to be quite a hassle with expensive drivetrain maintenance and failing electronics in the next few years.

A Lexus IS/GS fits into that price range, as does an Acura ILX/TLX. The former with the F-Sport package is incredibly striking."

"Location: Midwest, USAPrice range: $40,000 or less

Lease or Buy: Buy

New or used: Either one, though at this price I prefer New.

Type of vehicle: Sports Car or Sedan

Must haves: 4 doors (or a 2 door that can get kids in and out easily), Power(\~300+ horsepower or the ability to easily get there with modifications), relatively small (I like nimble cars and don't like driving boats; the feeling is most important here); AWD for winters would be nice but not a dealbreaker as I don't often go long distances.

Desired transmission: Manual without a doubt.

Intended use: Light use Daily Driver

Vehicles you've already considered: 2015+ Subaru WRX(not the STi); 2022 Hyundai Elantra N; A manual Mazda3,Mazda6, or MazdaSpeed.

Is this your 1st vehicle: No.

Do you need a Warranty: Nice to have, not necessary.

Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes.

Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: Some. I can do body work, paint correction, some engine issues, but I just don't have the means for a full teardown of engines or a swap.

Additional Notes: My first (and current) car is a 2000 Toyota Celica GT in automatic. I love this car. I love it so much that I'd almost consider getting the latest, lowest mileage version of the GT-S I can find in manual and just deal with the drawbacks. The biggest thing for me is that I love smaller, driver-centric, enthusiast cars but I am planning on having kids in a couple years and the Celica just doesn't fit my needs anymore in terms of power, transmission, or life needs. Thank you for all your help!"
"Just a tip even though the Veloster N may be cheaper upfront, if you factor in depreciation all Korean vehicles lose so much value over time. I'd say if you were to keep the vehicle for about 6-7 years the Type R would hold it's value so much better than the N, closing the gap of the overall cost to about even. Knowing that, why not just purchase the better vehicle even though it cost more upfront."

I've been putting in regular because I don't drive much anymore since I work from home but I have been meaning to put in premium to see if there's a big difference.  The manual says with premium you get the full 400 HP 400 Torque but with regular you take a hit on HP.  I am curious if there is a huge difference flooring it now feels pretty quick.  As for FE I have been averaging 24 MPG and that's a mix of driving to the post office, FedEx, or the grocery store and the occasional trip on the highway to go into the city for something which overall is pretty rare.  Curious if premium would bump that number up at all.

I fail to see how you can say that with a straight face yet claim the Veloster N doesn't excite you. It might not beat the Civic Type R, but it's one of the best, most fun FWD cars you can get.

Lincoln sedans since then failed to live up to the same driving experience except for the 3.0T AWD MKZ which I have now and I can't help but wonder how this would have done with a manual, it's a blast to drive and seriously underrated a lot of car guys don't even know it exists when I talk to them I say it has an EcoBoost and they instantly think of the I4.  So that would be one I would be really curious on.

Another would be the Subaru SVX from the 90s.  I thought for sure those had a manual option I remember seeing them in the show room as a kid when my mom bought her Legacy Wagon that had a manual.  I thought they were the coolest thing on the planet.  I was shocked to read they were auto only.  I see though there are manual conversions you can do but I can't help but wonder if a manual would have helped sales in the 90s when they were a lot more popular than they are today."

"Do you think thy  became famous for being “slow” bc they were capable of doing 6.2 seconds? Sure, Maybe they did with some aggressive launch (not replicable out there on the streets- which is what im talking about here).

That’s roughly 7.3 sec in mph.

Same thing here 

If you check out the link I posted early, Toyota THEMSELVES said 7 secs, maybe 6.8 at best depending on launch - with the manual, and 8 seconds for the auto. 

They were made fun of for being slow bc they were, on avg on the streets, hitting somewhere in the 7 secs…..

I dont know about you but 6.2 sec ain’t  slow."
"Agreed, the AWD thing is a huge part of CUV charm whether people need it or not. If my numbers are correct Veloster only sold 7500 units in 2021 and Kona about 52000.

Honda did miss a few things with their rev matching. In theory they should be able to do everything. Not sure about why they did it the way they did. So you’re left with a quirk of a feature.
It is probably due to a total lack of low end torque. I can confirm myself it is super sluggish if you gun it from 5mph even with bolt ons. Absolutely gutless. The FA24 is what the FA20 should have been.

Doesn't the RC350 have more than 300HP? Everything I read about the RC is that it's a fine car it's just a 6/10 for performance while it's rivals were more of 8 or 9/10.
It’s pretty sweet. Quite raw for an Aston but still comfortable. DBS powertrain in a small sports car platform with 3 pedals. Sounds incredible. Comes from the factory with a lightweight single-mass flywheel so it revs quite fast in both directions. Very different from the stock V8s in that respect. Set up to reward being driven hard so not an ideal daily. Great weekend car though! Mine has been very reliable. Unfortunately they didn’t make very many of them.
"Huge acceleration numbers with electric motors are not that hard to achieve, because electric motors are a lot simpler and efficient machines compared to ICEs, which are voodoo by comparison. Electricity is far easier of an energy form to convert than chemical explosions.

That's getting into a very competitive segment where you have faster cars with better tech and features.

 This is assuming you ignore track performance which lets be honest, 90% of CTRs will never see a track.

> That base truck includes a hybrid-electric drivetrain comprising a 2.5-liter Atkinson-cycle gas four-cylinder backed by Ford’s first in-house designed and manufactured electric motor. The hybrid system is the same integrated motor/generator incorporated into a planetary continuously variable transmission that Ford has used in previous hybrids. Those include the Escape SUV, which shares its underpinnings with the Maverick, although the pickup substitutes the new Ford electric motor for the purchased motor currently used in the Escape hybrid.

 [...]

> The Ford-designed and built electric motor is the most technically interesting detail of the Maverick and it provides benefits to both Ford and to buyers because the motor is smaller, 20 percent lighter, and cheaper than the motor in the Escape

[...]

> The electric motor can deliver as much as 2,300 Nm of torque and 98 kW of power

(Compared to 88 kW for the Escape motor.)

"You captured my thoughts on the usability and range being acceptable as a commuter car.

The article doesn't mention it, but I presume the $35k is without the federal credits right? So if you are in California its probably $25k with state + local incentives so it competes with the FWD RAV4 on price I think. Please correct me if I am wrong on the credits. That should put it about $3-4k cheaper than a base Prime. I would guess the Mazda is nicer to sit in, but the Prime is more versatile. I also imagine if these don't sell well they may get deals where I don't think the Prime will get any for years, if ever."

I think the BRZ had better driving dynamics. Its far lighter weight, lower center of gravity, lower drag etc all made it a real joy when you’re turning the wheel. Even with the crappy tires. the direct feel to the pavement was exceptional, even stock. I put a lot of track days thru that car, it inspired huge confidence and I grew my skill tremendously. 

The m2c is obviously waaaay more fun when the wheel is straight. but you only get maybe 5-15 seconds of full throttle per drive in it anyways… 

I’d definitely buy a brz again. I fell in love with it’s driving experience."

I found a guy who was willing to redo all the rocker rot for 800$, and I got the thing to pass inspection, but I suspect this car is going to continue to be a pain to maintain, especially since I live in the Northeast, where Winters eat away at cars.  My advice is to either ditch the car, keep the memories, or try and find a shop that'll hook you up for a reasonable price."

"IMO Acura made a lot of stupid decisions with this car. You're not wrong- it is 5 series weight because it's 5 series sized- on the outside. On the inside it's like a 3 series with more width. This is because Acura decided to add fake prestige gap and move to a double wishbone suspension up front without addressing the relatively cramped interior size of my car.

The 10th gen Accord is amazing. If it had AWD I would probably have one. That's pretty much all I wanted the TLX to be. They could have switched to the CTR's strut suspension which basically eliminates torque steer while being light and compact. Instead they went this way. I'm in TLX FB groups and after the initial hype subsided nobody is talking about these things, which says a lot as there are some real fanatics in those groups. Acura totally dropped the ball."

"And Accord V6s with manuals, especially the coupes! I think all manual V6 Accords were great but especially the 7th, 8th, and 9th gen USDM Accord coupes with the V6 and 6 speed manual. The 7th gen used the lighter weight J30 V6 and got a power bump over the earlier models, up to 244hp. Then the 8th and 9th gen coupes got the J35 V6 with 278hp. 

The icing on the cake was that the 6 speeds Honda used in those Accords were *really* freaking good, so good that they kinda spoiled us. I’ve driven my neighbor’s 10th gen Accord Sport 2.0t, and while it’s great that it’s a new car with a manual, it’s nowhere near as good as the manuals that Honda had hooked up to those J-series V6s."

"You won’t ever do this, because why would you downshift? If your rpms are already high you’re in the power band already. What would be gained by downshifting, as you’d be at the redline and immediately have to upshift again. 

You’re over thinking it I think. Don’t worry about downshifting, you won’t have the urge to do it if your engine is buzzing at 7K rpms. You’ll get the urge to do it when you want to pass someone and your revs are at like 4K, in which case you’re totally fine to drop a gear. 

By the way, try adding a little gas when the clutch is in and you’re downshifting. The revs will have to come up on any downshift and using the gas to get them there, rather than the clutch will be easier on the drivetrain. Plus it’s fun to match revs!"

I'd wager these OEMs could care less how the vehicles were sold just as long as they did get sold.

My cousin had bought a brand new Sierra 1500 in 2007. Decided quickly after he didn’t want to pay for the high gas prices. Truck still had dealer plates on and he went and traded it in for a Mini Cooper S. The mini dealer even tried to talk him out of it but he was dead set. Think he rolled in close to 10k in negative equity for the mini. Traded in the mini about 6 months later for a Ford F-250 with the 6.0. More negative equity and bad decisions
"I'm not going to listen to music that carries a racist message, but if it's not reflected in the music at all it doesn't generally stop me enjoying it. I avoid financially supporting people who are known to be shitebags, though - you wouldn't catch me wearing a Burzum shirt - and I do make a point of going out of my way to support and promote musicians who are sound in addition to writing good songs. 

Lostprophets is the ultimate extreme of this question after all the shit with their singer came out. I always thought their music was bit naff, but I feel like even if I did enjoy it, the crimes were *so* horrific and it was in the news so often and it got so tied to the name ""Lostprophets"", I wouldn't be able to listen to them without thinking about it, so that would almost certainly sour the experience a good deal."

I'd love to do something like this but just worried about overall cost. A lot of people downplay the actual price of LS swapping. It's almost always cheaper to just buy something with an LS already in it. I would love to swap a GM A body though. We owned a Chevelle when I was a kid and my dad loved that car. Doing another one like that would be awesome.

"Once he told Jagger ""I'm not your drummer. You're my singer"". RIP

Edit: ""One anecdote relates that in the mid-1980s, an intoxicated Jagger phoned Watts's hotel room in the middle of the night, asking, ""Where's my drummer?"" Watts reportedly got up, shaved, dressed in a suit, put on a tie and freshly shined shoes, descended the stairs, and punched Jagger in the face, saying: ""Don't ever call me your drummer again.

Great musician, yes, huge productor and marketer, but in reality
I'm sincerely appalled and how he unscathedly promotes a system of human control without thinking how his position mind wash the young and uninformed.   
I don't listen to Pink Floyd anymore and that's on me, I thought a genius in music should have criteria to identify oppression and suffering instead of writing about it in lyrics and empty handedly give it to people without being coherent in the message.   
He's literally just in for the money, when that's coming his way."

"The 993 Turbo engines are ridiculously heavy (589lbs), and the only real difference between the air-cooled and water-cooled chassis in terms of weight is the number of heat exchangers and density of water versus oil. As a point of comparison, the 996 Turbo engines weigh 573lbs.

The magnesium-cased, carbureted engines (69-73) were the lightest, but still weighed over 400lbs. As a point of comparison, the cast-iron-blocked, DOHC 2.4L 4-cylinder KA24DE out of a 240SX weighs 371lbs. As an additional point of comparison, the M96 3.4/3.6 out of the 996 weighs 440lbs.

The air-cooled cars had manual steering through the end of 3.2 Carrera production in 1989. The 964 and 993 had power steering. The 964 and 993 also had completely different suspension setups, sharing the front suspension and while the 964's rear suspension was pretty good, the 993's multi-link was a huge leap forward in terms of grip and stability.

The best air-cooled introduction, if you've only grown up with moderns, would be the 964. Then, I'd recommend a 3.2 Carrera, preferably non-G50. Then, a 2.4L MFI car. Finally, a SWB with Webers."

"I don't think ""eMuscle"" will be the name of the vehicle. It sounds more like a badge that will indicate the powertrain has an electric component to it (or is entirely electric). So, they bring out this flagship electric muscle car, show what they can really do with electric cars, then they add ""eMuscle"" to the existing lineup of gas vehicles to further increase their power output (at least as a transition until most or all vehicles are fully electric).

What they really need to do is market these things like freight trains. Modern freight trains are driven by electric motors... the diesel engines just provide the electricity for those motors. That's the idea they should be aligning with... that electric motors have a ton of power, and I assume that's the point of this flagship car. It's going to be expensive, but it's going to demonstrate that eMuscle isn't to be fucked with. That way, when they add eMuscle to their other vehicles that idea will carry over."
"There's *something* wrong with the story. A JRS supercharged 86 should be doing low 5s or just under 5 in good conditions/launch. In another comment /u/djtmalta00 says his dyno numbers were 222 wheel horsepower or 264 crank horsepower. That's significantly lower than [JRS' claimed \(and confirmed\) numbers of 285 HP/220 TQ](http://jacksonracing.com/jr-media/uploads/frs_vs_stock_web.jpg). I helped my father install his C38 JRS supercharger and we were able to recreate those dyno numbers almost exactly with JRS' stock (and recommended) tune. 

Something is very off here."
"I mean even the possibility that cars like that would ever appreciate to any meaningful degree is  a pretty recent historical phenomenon likely linked to the money printer working overtime and people having more cash than brains in recent years as all assets have exploded, and frankly it's very possible it's not something that lasts long, so it's hardly a great thing to base buying decisions on. Even then it's a couple thousand bucks. Who really cares. Buy what makes you happy + what's in your budget."

"I'd like to see it rebadged as a Volvo or Proton for other markets. 8-speed auto only, but 260 horsepower and AWD sounds neat. The only question is whether the AWD system would satisfy us internet enthusiasts.

It actually showed up in Malaysia back in 2019. For a photoshoot. At least reviewers got to sit in it."
"Ford quoted 252 crank horsepower on the 3rd gen ST. Dyno testing them stock shows that they generally make around 220 wheel horsepower ([per Focus ST Forums](https://www.focusst.org/threads/stock-wheel-horsepower.14161/)). Assuming a 10% to 15% drivetrain loss, this would be the expected power output at the tires.

Honda quote 205 crank horsepower on the 10th gen Si. However, dyno testing shows that they are underrating that figure, and are actually quoting wheel horsepower ([per JSTuned](https://jst-performance.com/blogs/jst-results-blog/2017-honda-civic-si-dyno-results), who quote 230 wheel for the ST in that synopsis).

So yes, the Focus ST makes more power than the 10th gen Si, but it is more in the 15hp-20hp range, not 50hp. However, from what I have seen the Civic is also lighter than the Focus, and with the way the torque hits (the Si spools quicker and hits peak torque earlier than the ST), they feel very comparable on speed."

"It's such a bad feeling to think you have 400hp when really you have like 360hp because of low octane. I'm in Canada and our top tier gas is worse than US 91. N54 335i guys buy JB4 tunes and all claim 400whp. They don't realize the power was made on high quality 91 from the USA. I claim stock 360-380whp for my Mustang. I've taken down a few and stayed side by side with other 335is when they should easily beat me. 

I have no problem admitting a modded $9k 335I should take my Mustang down, but with our bad gas they just don't make the advertised power they should with a tune."
"It's not a problem to get 93, 100, E85 etc in the Bay Area - couple dozen specialty stations scattered around. I imagine it's similar in LA. Outside of major metros might be tough though, and 91 is the standard for premium.

That's why I always get the panorama sunroof option if I have to get a dark interior. Even if I never open it up, it still makes dark interiors feel more open and less drab"

"In my experience, Michigan is a *very* skewed demographic of vehicles purchased. Since the big 3 have such a massive presence in Metro Detroit as well as many auto suppliers, lots of those employees will buy from their respective OEMs with the crazy discounts they get. You leave Michigan and many American vehicle brands are popular in other states, but they're definitely not nearly as common as they are in Michigan."
"I reckon they were derivative of their favourite influences and being the age they were it’s easily to see how much they emulated those bands.

"> I mean....that's not Chevy's fault that regular owners can't get all the potential out of it. You think the average Koenigsegg or Ferrari or even Porsche owner is able to? No.

Ahh, but the difference is the average driver can, with enough practice, ring 95% of what a GT3 has out of it. The ZR1 isn't like that, it's just a bitch. No finesse, just POWAAAAH until it wraps itself around a tree and kills you.

"> It was always 911 Carrera money for 911 Carrera performance but with a special driving experience and superb reliability.

"[So Alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L41MhFPU9s) by Love and Rockets.

This was the ""hit song"" they had in 1989, and if that's all you knew of them, you never really knew the band at all.

I got into the band back in my late 80s post-college ""I'm gonna get high and avoid doing anything with my life of any consequence"" phase, and it was great.  Love and Rockets was music for stoners, by stoners.

Then they had a hit.  

I remember going to a show - Fox Theater in Detroit in 1989 - where they were riding high on the success of their hit song.  Thing is, most of the audience were like me and my roommate.  Fans who discovered them after they stopped being Bauhaus, put out a few albums, and had a side project called Tones on Tail.  There was someone who'd even made a Tones on Tail denim jacket a  few rows ahead of us in the theater.

Anyway, the show was awesome.  We were all pretty baked.  Then they played ""the hit single.""  Even had a backup vocalist onstage.  The audience crossed their arms in unison and waited patiently for the hit single to be over.  They weren't having it.

Then the band went into a long, trippy set of the songs we loved, and everything was right with the world.  [Saudade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkJiT64ZgQ)"

"Genesis in my experience was a shit show. I put down interest for a G70 launch edition. Genesis concierge called and confirmed the dealership had one, scheduled a test drive for me etc. I show up to the hyundai dealership and they tell me that they actually don't have any G70 for me to test drive, nor a launch edition on hand.

So not a great start. Then we started talking price to get a rough lease estimate. For reference, I'm in my very very early 20s. I have been fortunate enough to land a job which pays enough to give me a large price range when buying a car, but I definitely don't look like your average luxury car buyer. The dealer sees me, turns to me and goes ""you know this is a 55k car right?"" So I respond ""yes, I'm aware"" and he goes ""Im just making sure you can afford this"". Thanks man. I totally came in here ready to reserve and you're already making me want to leave. 

Then he finally comes back and tells me for a 10k mile, 36 month lease that they wanted over 800 dollars a month. I just walked out. Went and custom ordered and leased a BMW X3M for more instead. At least with the X3M the monthly is in line with the total cost. Charging over 800 a month on a G70 is just ridiculous. 

That's overall been the hard part of Genesis. Great cars, great concierge, but holy fuck the hyundai network is bad. Get treated like shit and ripped on price. I'll just go elsewhere."

So i cant just go and not listen to the musics that always said or translated what i feel as a person, deep inside where no one elses ever went but myself.

"At some point they were rather popular, especially after the release of their single (and the relative music video) ""Black no.1"" in 1993, but nowhere near Nirvana or Pearl Jam. I guess the peak of their fame was in the '90s, then they slowly faded back into obscurity."
I'm pretty loyal to Shell.
"It was like 11-12 years ago, so participation trophies weren't a thing yet I guess (joking). I don't even think I slid through the stop sign. IIRC, the ABS kicked on midway down the hill and I was able to come to a complete rolling stop just fine. But ABS kicked on so it was an auto fail.  

BUT, no excuses. Relying on ABS during a drivers test *should* be an auto fail."

"Compliance vehicles are literally the opposite of halo vehicles. It's the automaker saying, well, the law told us to build exactly this and we did. 

Tesla lobbied CARB to force smaller automakers to also make EVs or buy credits instead of letting them earn partial credit with hybrids and fuel efficient vehicles, which was also around the time Mazda got kicked out of the house by Ford (thus no easy access to credits and no R&D budget). 

So they copy pasted someone else's 2015 compliance car. Subaru is in the same boat, but they have enough credits stockpiled to probably last them until Toyota's EV is ready."
"I worked for a Hyundai dealer for about a year in the UK. We loved the i30N, because it sounded great, looked great, and drove wonderfully even by the relatively high standards the UK has for hot hatches. Unfortunately it had no brand recognition and so tended only to be bought by serious enthusiasts, whereas the 20-something yobbos looking to impress their mates bought Golf Rs and the like. In the US I think they've missed out enormously by not offering an Elantra N and/or Sonata N. Honda has clearly done well with the Civic Si and VW has seen enough market segment to bring the Mk8 GTI to the US alongside the GLI, so I do think small,  fun, practical cars still have a place in the market. I wonder if Kia's marketing division have been given too much power over the N brand rather than letting the engineers loose to build what they want. Most of the cachet behind strong performance sub-brands comes from engineering prowess, motorsport success, and/or the ability to build a real halo car. AMG were a tuning company in their own right and have given Mercedes the SLS and AMG GT, M started with the M1 and built a reputation for building the best sports sedans full stop, quattro/Audi Sport came from the Quattro rally cars of the '80s and has had a hand in cars like the R8, and even F was given real weight when Lexus finally got around to selling the LFA. Hyundai has built a pair of admittedly excellent hot hatches for different markets and then slapped some N-Line badging on their lineup. Give me a G80 N with a turbo V8 and then we'll talk."

"I think his death really sucked the soul out of the rest of them. You can tell the music isn't coming from the same creative spark, and it's not just because the drums are different. They sound like they're writing music because they have to, or because they *want* to carry on, but it doesn't have the fire it used to... I dunno, their story makes me sad because they were fucking incredible. And they're still insanely talented, but I can only imagine how hard it is to keep going after losing what's basically a family member at that point.

Mad respect for them though, and they had a recent album that was really good. Hurts to think how they'd be different if the Rev was still around though."
"Nah don't forget about the 10 yr/100,000 mi powertrain warranty, plus a 5 yr/60,000 mi basic.

That powertrain warranty is a *HUGE* incentive. 


Most brands don't even have a powertrain warranty for as long as Kia offers just a basic warranty. 

I think the next best is VW @ 6 yr/72,000 mi basic, 6 yr/72,000 mi powertrain"
"Some moreso, and some less so than others.

Big Three full-size pickups (and their full-size SUV counterparts) are about as common in Michigan as they are anywhere else - coastal areas will have less of them as a consequence of big trucks in general being less popular, but even there the ratio remains overwhelmingly domestic.

The same could’ve been said of the Explorer for a while due to its dominant market position.  Its popularity in Michigan is still about the same as everywhere else, but that’s because the new generation has managed to scare away a lot of previous Ford loyalists who know what a giant piece of shit it is from being affiliated.

On the flip side, the moment you leave Michigan, the presence of American luxury brands - and in particular Lincoln - falls off a cliff.  The streets in Southeast Michigan are swarming with Corsairs and Aviators, but you’ll be lucky to find more than a dozen of each in a comparably-sized coastal metro area.  Last time I was in Philly and New York, I saw more Lotuses than Aviators.

In between, you have stuff like the Equinox, XT6, or Wrangler, which lose noticeable amounts of relative popularity, but not enough to be exotic car levels of rare."

Ive never seen a Stinger with discounts around me. A non kia dealer ship is selling a 2018 gt2 for $50k and another is selling a 2021 GT for $49. The actual Kia dealership was asking $46 for a 4cyl 2wd one last summer. I know prices are screwed now but I was really hoping to get into one in the next year or so but seems unlikely.

"Their point is that Ford knows the Lightning will be super popular. It's surprising they aren't investing more heavily in production, and I agree. 80k is only ~10% of their annual F-series sales, and by 2024 demand will have only increased. 80k is just a surprisingly low number considering the company, brand, and what the truck will offer.

Should I be supporting these artist in some way financially(this could be in the form of buying their albums, singles,merch, tickets to concerts, or even listening to their music on radio and streaming services). That’s an emphatic NO! So how do I consume the art without supporting the artist financially? Easy, steal their music by downloading it illegally online or buy their physical media used so that no money goes directly into the artist pocket. By continuing to enjoy and consume their work without paying a dime it’s the ultimate F U."

I first saw the Stones in the mid 70’s and was immediately drawn to him. He was my very first musical idol and i was always excited when a new album and tour was announced, with the hope that the Stones would play in my area. I have shed a few tears over this unfortunate news, but I smile knowing i was lucky enough to get to meet him and shake his hand once and was able to say Thank you. It seems like yesterday that i met him, but that was like 26 years ago already. Rock on Charlie, thank you for the wonderful memories."

Many threads with thousands of upvotes appeared after its announcement with hyperbolic claims of it being a ""game changer"" and how it will crush all electric truck competitors.

But now we know that Ford only plans to manufacture about [15,000 Lightnings in 2022](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-ford-doubles-lightning-production-target-strong-pre-launch-demand-2021-08-23/), ramping up to only 80,000 by 2024.

"To add to this: Gearing is also just as important. With regards to the Impreza a turbo plus anti lag plus a sequential gear box with short gearing means you don't have a drop in power while accelerating and can stay near the peak power and throughout.

Many street / hyper cars will still be in 2nd gear at 60mph. The STI tops out at 160mph in 6th gear despite plenty of power. Many hyper cars will have gearing for 200+mph (though they may not be able to reach that due to power / drag)"

Prior to this they had not done any car shopping or research."
Hi Sam how do you come up with such amazing songs?
"No, you can still buy new ones and someone who wants a new Camaro isn't looking at 5 year old used ones."
"Often the gear just straight up blocks.

The synchronizer was never designed to synchronize this large of an rpm difference, it will not be able to match rpm of the input shaft within a few seconds so you'd have to be forcing it hard for a few seconds to actually get it in.

A 3-4-3 misshift is easier to make as the rpm difference is smaller, you can often just slam those in but if you're paying attention you should notice the gear took more force than usual and not let out the clutch.

If you're really in a big rush on the track.... Yeah shit can go wrong."
"Why stand, when you can sit?"
"Depends on the model. For hatchbacks, even the base LX has a 1.5L. In sedans, you still don’t have to get the top trim. The mid-trim EX has a the 1.5L too."
Nice I like it
This is why I just get cars with more power. I had a few 4 banger Hondas with the last one being an 8th gen Civic. It was fun to beat on but it was just loud slow and annoying in traffic. And with fast manual cars I find the constant interruption of power annoying. Only manuals I like are on motorcycles as the shifts are very fast.
What's funny is that some people feel the urge to be silly....
Don't bother if you can't fabricate or have never completed any serious projects.  I've been building cars for 20 years and my LS swap was a serious undertaking.

"Let me tell you, I hate these 7,8,9+ automatic transmissions. But Hyundai/Genesis has the best automatic I’ve ever experienced in terms of shift ratios. The Palisade has an 8 speed and shifts like butter and makes the 3.7l feel like a 5.7 tuned perfectly."
"I just worry about remounting wheels and possibly damaging them as well as crap from the roads coming up and scratching the brakes. I've heard some horror stories on Porsche CCBs regarding this but I'll see when the time comes.

"The transmission was not designed to be an enthusiast's choice. It was designed to appeal to a different demographic. That doesn't mean an enthusiast can't get one, but you can't honestly say it was designed to be as fun and rewarding as the manual.

They say that because those automatics are actually good and are focused on being rewarding and fun, which means they appeal to enthusiasts."
I’ll buy that.
">but christ, what were they thinking?

There is a specific history with the term ""scat pack"" (IIRC it was a handful  of Chrysler cars that were particularly performance oriented but were not the halo muscle cars, but I'm not sure) but the term ""scat"" was also slang back then for, as best as I can put it, ""leaving quickly"". Ex. ""Scat, cat! Get out of here!""

It's a retro thing. A callback to the muscle car era. I don't know why everyone is baffled by it. I'm in my mid-30's, born way past the period of time in which this term was in use, and when the scat packs came out I never thought poop."

It was definitely the interior for me. It did not age well at all. I don't know how you update the interior and properly market that though. I also don't know how you change the interior and change the stigma behind the car itself being 12 years old too (at least to the casual consumer).

"C&D uses a .3 second roll out, and even they didn't replicate that time on their other BRZ's. Their long term BRZ got progressively slower at 40K miles and went from 6.3 to 6.7. So with the same car across three tests and the .3 second roll out removed, it averaged 6.75 seconds 0-60. MT's results range from 6.4-6.8, Edmunds has it at 7.3 and Evo UK at 6.9. That's an average of 6.8 seconds without the roll out, even with roll out, its still 6.7. C&D's autos was a full second slower at 7.7 seconds. 

I don't know what the take rate on autos was, but 7 seconds looks to be pretty damn accurate from this data alone."

"Fascinating, I went through a right on red with oncoming traffic almost, and then completely botched backing up into a spot and got passed anyway. Was told ""just don't try backing into a spot next to other cars until you've practiced"". Also nearly tailgated a school bus. Do what I did and make sure to be more alert moving forward about the mistake you made. No better way to learn than having a ""professional"" correct you.

This is the correct answer.  It would have been a great alternative to the Lotus Elise had they given it a manual.  It never really found its niche because of that.

"I actually liked Sound and Fury lol. I guess with anything some of the fan base may be too quick to pigeonhole artists into one type/genre of music, or fear they may be going the way of ""made for radio"" material (a legitimate concern granted), but Sturgill Simpson seems to be making the music he enjoys playing. 

We get to experience some of that enjoyment via osmosis when we listen to his music, and the cool thing is we don't have to think about how to categorize it into genre as we listen. It's just the genre of Sturgill Simpson.

How was the live performance? Never had the chance to catch either his current band or Sunday Valley."
He's fuckin awesome

"11 extra HP and a sport trim that isn't a base with a manual? Sounds great.

>New for 2022 is the Jetta Sport trim, which features enthusiast-inspired content at a value-oriented price point. The XDS electronic differential lock and dark graphite 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels are standard, along with a blacked-out grille, mirror caps and window trim, a black headliner, and unique cloth sport seats. The Sport trim replaces the previous model year’s R-Line trim, and is repositioned just above the base S trim for maximum accessibility.

...and I just found the replacement for my current Jetta when the warranty is up on mine."
I'm not surprised. I've been honestly expecting this to happen. We are going to see a shift to more cars being hybrids and EVs and it's only natural that they start with some expensive performance cars first so they can more easily pay off the tech and move it throughout the rest of the lineup. EVs are different but I'm excited about more performance oriented EV cars within the next few years.

"For daily use they suck. Once you get them on a track or autocross they're incredible. I bought mine strictly for that purpose and I don't regret it at all, but I have another car that I use for all the daily stuff (no commute anymore either). So yeah, the hype around them for driving on normal roads is definitely too high, but the hype for their track performance isn't."

"She started her career as an actress. She’s been on Disney shows, but also is in an episode of New Girl. She had a very public relationship breakup with a costar or her show who quickly started dating another person, and many of her songs are specifically about this.

Her first big song was Driver’s License, which is an objectively great pop ballad. I would recommend it if you’ve liked her other songs. She is a writer on her album and is the sole writing credit on several songs (aka she has actual musical talent and isn’t a Katy Perry who is just given stuff to sing).

She also legitimately has a great voice. If you listen to her performance on SNL it sounds exactly like her album. The vocals on her album are not tampered with much, if at all."

"A 1.5L Accord (the vast majority) are pretty mediocre at around 7.2 sec. It's only the 2L versions and they're around 5.5 if they launch. That's not that much faster than 5.7-5.9. Its 5-60 is around 6.4 sec since it's turbo which is more indicative of its real world acceleration. So they're likely to be very close in a real scenario. 

And the 86 is much more fun to drive."
Most dealers got 1 bronco as a test mule but can't sell it.
"> go buy a mustang or Camaro or my wrx off me lol

These are also slow. True enthusiasts only drive top fuel dragsters down residential streets."
This is probably off topic… but what do you do for a job? Those all seem like super expensive cars and it still blows my mind how casually people talk about buying brand new vehicles almost every year.

"If you were into any kind of metal in the 90s, chances were you at least knew of Type O Negative.

"The Bronco roof situation isn’t really indicative of anything besides how Ford reacts to a problem, in which case I’d say they handled it rather well.  You have to consider the problem part itself when thinking about what could’ve gone wrong.

Literally nobody at Ford, unless they were poached from the Wrangler body team, has experience with designing removable roof panels.  Nor will any of them have much experience with optimizing their design.  The supplier gets fingered if things go wrong because they signed that contract anyways, but the root cause is the roof design itself.

No technical unknown of such magnitude exists for the Maverick.  It’s literally a C2 platform parts special.  Does that guarantee there won’t be problems?  Of course not, but the chances of a catastrophe are orders of magnitude lower."
I would love a 2011 4x4 v6 RAV4 with a manual

"I meant that it will take a lot of engineering work to turn a unibody ICE into an EV.  The resulting vehicle may not even be able to use the same tooling as the petrol Maverick.  Same goes for an EV Bronco Sport.

Speaking of which, I don’t disagree that an electric Bronco Sport would sell better an electric version of the proper one, but remember that the petrol Bronco is literally Ford’s most inefficient personal vehicle, bested only by F-450 and larger commercial trucks.  Going electric on the Bronco will go a long way towards offsetting the massive CAFE penalty of the petrol one."

"I'm speaking in averages, not for everyone singularly, which would be impossible so I'm not sure why you're offended.

"Eh I'd argue that the Telluride is nicer than the Pilot, and definitely has more third-row legroom than the Highlander. I just wouldn't even think of spending $62k on a fucking Telluride. That's insane. You're going into real luxury car territory at that point."

">The performance trim is the one that comes standard with an LSD. The pack costs $5,000.

Where did you get pricing info? $5k is a pretty good price for the LSD plus the interior, wheel/tire, and brake upgrades."
Where’d you get these numbers? They don’t seem accurate considering that you wrote the 2.4L 4 cyl has an equivalent 0-60 as the 3.5P 6 cylinder. Two more cylinders an 1.1 liters but they’re acceleration is the same?
"So ""getting in tune wirh your feelings"" means disgracing the Spanish language with your woke political agenda?

And I was just going to say the Chiron should have def had three on the tree as an option.
"This is a bit of an old wives tale. If you’re referring independent crash tests like IIHS and NHTSA, the manufacturer doesn’t pay for those.  Likewise, you don’t need to be certified to be sold.

For example, no Porsche or Jaguar models have been rated by the NHTSA.

If your referring to internal crash tests, car manufacturers need to do that for every model regardless."
"The C8

Now, hear me out, the thing was suppose to change the landscape of American Sport cars or be the second coming of Christ. 

Every reviewer said its an amazing car and the pinnacle for American made cars. 

However, it seems to me people have the car for a month or two then sell it. Saying yeah, the car is fantastic but it has no soul. There are several youtubers that kept for a month and went 'meh' and even there was a top thread here that they sold their C8. 

To be fair, the used car market is insane right now and the C8 was already marked up if you bought a C8 at launch you could probably sell for a good profit. 

But if the car matched up to all the hype, people wouldn't dare to sell it. 

I'm not saying the C8 isn't a good car, but it seems to me, people who have actually owned it just went ""the car is great but...""

"So, the Rav4 Prime is still the second fastest Toyota."
"Manuals usually have higher crawl ratio gear than automatics. So basically, when both manual and automatic are on 1st gear with 4L engaged descending a steep hill in idle engine speed, the automatic will descend faster than manual. Don't descent while in Neutral because the engine are the one that control the wheel speed."

There are only a couple of those. 

That's it. That's an incredibly small drip for the world's largest car market, and one with *hundreds* of brands. All of the above people are doing incredibly important work, imo, building a written/filmed history of an emerging player which is one hundred percent locked in to transform the industry over the next decade.

"They're basically pulling a 90's Honda. I'm sure in another decade people will remember their affordable fun cars fondly, especially as these cars make their way into the used market and gain a cult following. 

But just like no one aspires to drive a Honda, no one dreams of driving an N car. It's just the one you can afford after reality kicks in, and that's fine. 

But the Goose loaded the question with ""branding"", and branding is typically associated with luxury, and luxury tends to be bought with a heritage of being the best. Hyundai is trying to skip the heritage and being the best part (but still marketing/acting as if they had it), so it's not terribly surprising the brand doesn't have much cachet."
"The second’s product goal is basically the same as the first. Deliver a daily drivable supercar through cutting edge technology. They definitely stuck to the same formula.

"I personally know several CUV drivers, and I don’t think any of them have the foggiest idea of what the driven wheels are. Or any other tech specs for that matter. They just like “sitting up high,” having the cargo space, and the appearance of safety by virtue of the car’s size. Plus it’s just an unspoken herd mentality. Everyone is buying them, so they must be good.

That said, I’m sure it’s a bigger selling point for performance trims, even if it’s just a Haldex."

"There’s tons of well-paid blue collar folks and white-collar folks in this sub, as well as a lot of proper “rich” people. 

It seems like it’s an above average amount, but it’s because cars are generally an expensive hobby, so this sub attracts a higher number of well-off people."

"Well it’s a good thing Mazda makes their money from new car sales and people looking to buy new, not used cars, then."
"Interesting. In the UK Vpower was 98 and it's been upgraded to 99.

In Germany, premium was either 99/100 and ultra 102.

Sounds like something unique to Finland."
"Someone tracked that very Mustang down to a Junkyard in Mexico.  It was on sad condition.  He bought it and is restoring it to its former glory.  He may have already finished restoring it, I don't really know."
"That’s the thing about driving tests 😂. I’m currently taking lessons and my instructor is telling me about the so many ways I can fail the test. Makes you think that even you blink you might forget something or miss something and you’re done! All I can say is, I hope you pass next time 👍."
"Honestly, I'd probably take the Zupra over it, but I'm a good couple years from worrying about it.  I can still hold out for that unlikely manual version."
"Don't own one, but I've driven one. I feel like it improves on the Pilot in terms of convenience and driving experience, for folks who don't need a third row and would rather not have a vehicle that's too big. I think it's great.

Two competitors worth considering, both are three-rows but if you keep the third row folded down, you get a lot for your money: The Mazda CX-9 in Touring trim with the Premium package, and the new Kia Sorento in EX trim. The CX-9 is as long as the Pilot, but it drives well and the interior space is great. The Sorento is similarly sized to the Passport and provides a lot of value, but you'll wanna go AWD if you get the turbo engine to improve the driving experience."
Every track is absolutely solid.
"Yeah Rod Bearings, VANOS, Subframe are the main things on these. 

I recently bought a 140k mile E39 M5 as well and have a lot on my plate from new bushings needed all around the rear subframe to the AC not working and other small/costly things. 

The smile these cars put on your face is all worth it though. And the values are only going up!"
"Their lineup has always been pretty diverse. I'm not sure where the line gets drawn in deeming something ""appropriation"" but I'm not sure it applies here. 

But I dunno. Shit slaps."
"This. I bought mine as a family car primarily with a great engine for fun drives. GT came packed with options which would cost absurd amounts in german rivals plus the maintenence is a lot cheaper than audi, bmw and merc. At first tje prices seem similar and 50k for a kia seem ludicrous but costs quickly add up with more luxurious competitors. It is a really nice and comfortable grand tourer in the end."
Was it sensitive and easily switched to 8 cylinders?   I’m assuming it’s dropping to 4 for the high MPGs.  Have no idea how similar the system is to other GM models.  I can get 30+ on the highway but it doesn’t last long in the city.   Any little hill or gentle increase in acceleration and it switches back to 8.   Sporty car so I get it but so many rave about the efficiency as if it kicks in easier and lasts longer.  Really curious.
"Such a great track.

You can spend more time in the higher parts of the torque and power curve while accelerating.
"Manual should be the default, automatics should be a luxury and accessibility feature. Having an automatic gearbox opens up the drivers hands to focus on things other than controlling the car."
"It makes sense as a second car for people who live in the suburbs/city, and have an ICE car as their main vehicle. I drive 30 mins to and from work each day, plus maybe some extra for errands, so I could make this work (if I had a garage/reliable charger).

I can see why people would be less than enthused about the specs if they were looking to replace a daily driver that goes on long road trips occasionally."
"I found a brief opinion article that states some of the stuff he said and I'm just sitting here appalled. I grew up under a rock (think of the folks in a cult. My reality was pretty similar). And I heard two songs vy Morrissey- You Have Killed Me, and Irish Blood, English Heart. 

I assumed he was some fad at the time (2004 or so) and never thought to look him up after the age of internet exploded. I recently had one of those songs stuck in my head, looked it up on Spotify, and essentially discovered The Smiths and Morrissey. Being the way I am, I just listened to the music without ever googling the person.

Man oh man. I thought I stumbled on something pretty cool but now I'm just feeling like all those sadboi lyrics are lies. What a POS."

"They are trying very *hard* to build artificial brand cachet by increasing their prices.

At 33k, who is their right fucking mind would purchase it over *checks notes* literally any other entry performance car.

"It depends how far you want to go, and what your priorities are.

It's comparable to the Mini Electric and Honda E, for instance.

It gets beat out by the ID.3 on price/range, but if range isn't a concern for you and you only use the car for groceries or visiting your sister the next town over, it's arguably a much nicer car than the ID.3.

In places like Japan or the UK, for any greater distance than that, you'll just take the train.

The MX-30 will easily take you from Amsterdam to Rotterdam, or Glasgow to Edinburgh, or Southhampton to Brighton, or Zurich to Lucerne, or Barcelona to Sitges.

The 86 is a quick car compared to other manual transmission cars. I have a tuned si and they keep up pretty good with me from a dead stop. The cvt just keeps the revs at peak power way better than a manual with the same horsepower rating.

"Just to add to what everyone else is chiming in with, while they did occasionally tour around, apparently Pete really didn't like leaving NYC, so most of their shows were played in the city. That kinda restrictive touring likely didn't help them any. He had a lot of anxiety which apparently was a cause of it, and he ""managed"" his on stage performance anxiety with alcohol, which didn't end up helping the caliber of the act any either. It's a sad story, he was incredibly talented, as are the other band members.

Also, as far as being niche, they were pretty open about the fact that the bands and the music were a vehicle to get laid 😆 While that flew fine with most of the goth audience, the angst-ier fans of other bands Type-O fans would listen to (like NiN, and the others you listed) were not as ok with it.

Ps in case anyone thinks otherwise, I'm quite a fan of all the bands I mentioned, as well as the ones name checked in the OP."

Low center of gravity doesnt mean as much when the car weighs 5000lb. Its still a pig.

EVs are appliances for people who dont like cars. Thats fine. Nothing wrong with that. I just dont know why enthusiasts cheer them on. EVs do not offer even 5% of the driving experience or the driving engagement that an ICE car does. I truly cannot understand why someone would want an EV for their fun, weekend car unless they've just never experienced a good ICE car."

Yeah it seems like first gear only.
I have no idea who paid 50k for their stinger and looks like there are a few earlier year models/GT2s that did but I ended up with a 21 GT1 for 41k after all the discounts. So everyone calling it the 50k Kia confuses me. Maybe I got lucky right before the used market shot through the roof along with the semiconductor shortage and knowing the 22 facelift was coming probably didn’t hurt. Everywhere I read on the forums I thought I was seeing this being a normal price but maybe I lucked out seeing as the car had been on lot for 4.5 months when I found it.

"I have also worked for GM & my roommate previously worked for GM and now works for Rivian.  I would say your statements about Rivian & GM are very accurate here.

Something to keep in mind, Rivian didn't have 401K matching at the time (not sure if that is still the case) and with the normal annual bonus at GM, as well as tuition reimbursement for higher education at GM it took roughly $20K higher annual salary at Rivian before there was a ""break-even"" point.

(for reference: at GM the 401K I believe it is 4% from employer directly plus 4% matching. So up to 8% from GM.  The funds aren't vested until you have worked for 3yrs, so you won't be able to take the GM added funds with you if leave within 3yrs of hiring in)

my roommate took the Rivian offer because it was much higher than 20K difference and was looking for a different culture.   Depends on the day but sometimes he regrets the switch and sometimes not.     Work-life balance is controlled by you, however the pressure to work ""start-up"" hours are heavily present at Rivian, however some may find it more rewarding.

Side note:  The GM relocation package to help you move to start work is very generous and can really help you get setup in a good spot early. It was calculated by distance away from employer and with me moving in a single truck from the south-east US it was well over my moving costs which allowed me to furnish my place comfortably without worrying about every home purchase."

Where does one find a new Veloster N? Their website says there is 1 within 200 miles of my location. I haven't considered Hyundai or Kia because their dealerships have terrible reputations and I couldn't find one of their cars in stock in the slight chance I wanted to wade through the gauntlet that is their dealer network.

"One thing to consider is that dollar for dollar, you'll get a lot more features on a non-luxury car compared to a luxury car and its heaps of packages."
"I think all people who like Tesla's know the interior and the build quality isn't up to par, the most common opinion is that it's ""not that bad"", but that's because for most Tesla buyers their only frame of reference is cheap cars like civics and corsas, and the quality is on par with them. If you've never seen what a 50k+ car should feel like, you don't have that comparison point, however anyone with a Tesla who went into a Porsche taycan went ""oh"" and very quickly realised that Tesla's are miles behind in the interior"
"Couldn't agree more. I fell off the strokes train after First Impressions and was so pleasantly surprised to find this song.

I suggest giving I'll Try Anything Once a listen if you haven't already. It has a similar stripped back vibe with just Julian singing with light piano accompaniment. I really prefer [this version](https://youtu.be/ee06fbggZ0g) to the newer live recording."

"The CLA comes in station, diesel and manual. Not that exciting with only 112 HP though. 

150HP ST Focus Diesel wagon also exists and is slightly faster. 

318i comes in wagon and manual, probably slightly more fun to drive as it's rwd. 

Mazda 6, with 164HP and a manual isn't too shabby, but not a diesel. 

Still the Ford Focus ST-3 with 280HP is probably the most exciting manual wagon for sale. 

However all these cars I've mentioned probably aren't for sale in the US."

"Agreed on all points - an LSD and a less coarse engine would have really put it over the top. And I would have gladly paid extra for the pano sunroof and ventilated seats. Oh well, it’s still got a lot to enjoy, especially at that price point."
"I’m absolutely gutted by this news. I really hope the Stones decide not to continue after they fulfill the dates of this tour, if indeed they decide to carry on with it as planned. 

Charlie was more a Stone than Brian Jones, Bill Wyman or Ronnie Wood. Nearly 60 years. 

I’ve seen them play several times since I was a kid in big stadiums as well as smaller clubs. My mum and dad used to watch them at the old Lewisham Odeon in South London. My mum even worked at the same advertising agency as Charlie and bumped into them several times during the 60’s. Charlie reportedly would always be a quiet presence, but a friendly one by all accounts. 

He did smack Mick Jagger for calling Charlie “his drummer” though 😂

RIP Charlie. Thanks for being the feet and backbone of the greatest Rock and Roll band ever. ❤️"

"The best argument I could see is that the Bolt interior is pretty brutal and I would guess the Mazda is pretty nice with their upmarket goals. Incentives brings the price down on these (provided $36k is MSRP) to not be crazy more than a Bolt. 

If you aren't ever driving more than 100 miles, it's probably a much nicer place to sit than the Bolt. But you pay a premium for that. But then again, people pay for vehicles like the Lexus ES when you could buy a nice Camry for less, so it isn't unprecedented. Mazda just needs to make it _really, really,_ nice to be in."

">The N brand never seems ready to commit, and seems to dodge obvious match ups against segment leaders.

There is only one issue with the N products and it is the Hyundai badge on them that you and so many commenters here can't get past. The Veloster N is objectively and subjectively better than every sub-luxury sport compact sold in North America save the Type R, a car that is frequently ridiculed for its appearance and price.

You seem to be out of touch with the sport compact buyer to whom price is immensely important. Hyundai isn't avoiding the Civic Type R because of the comparison. The two cars have been compared to death. They're avoiding the price point because they know people will continue to look past what the product offers simply due to the badge. 

Besides, the entire notion that if something isn't the best in it's segment, it isn't a serious product is absurd and asinine but you already know that. You bought a 718 GTS instead of more capable performance cars because of the subjective experience."
?
This has been an issue with the RSX 6 speed transmission as well. Frequent trans oil changes helped but what finally fixed it was replacing the cmc to an older year civic si master.
How is this a struggle for you? There isn’t anything disingenuous. Ford is a production power house to Tesla. That’s the point.

I hope they look at Chevy selling as many C8s as they can build and take a hint. I see 2-4 C8s a day in ATX, it's insane.

Early 1970's Datsun 510 wagon. The gear ratios were so good they used them in their competition and rally cars. Loved going through the gears in my old 510 wagon...
"a normal downshif is going down one gear, like 3-2 (please rev match, its kinder on the clutch) but a money shift involves over reving the engine. say your are accelerating hard from 2 gear and you go to grab third but you miss the gate and go into first and release the clutch. because the wheel speed excedes the engine speed your engine will over rev, causing catestrophic and expensive damage to your engine, hence the name, money shift.

you could imagine if you are going 50mph at 7k rpm in second gear and you then slam into first gear, depending on the gearing of the car the revs could dubble and would without a doubt far excede the rev limit of your engine. (and then it would explode in a fiery blaze of embaressment)"
"John was a strong guitar player. Maybe he wasn't a great *lead* player, but he was a great rhythm player and was pretty good at finger-picking."
"That seems like a stretch. I don't really see much similarity between the BMW M and the Hyundai N except they are alphabet letters used for performance models. The N vehicles all been relatively keenly priced FWD vehicles with LSD and no AWD, and fairly modest engine power overall, going for the affordable fun factor more so than outright performance."

"The Crown is definitely a very nice car. Its ride quality is amazing, interior's luxurious, and its even handles decently well. It's a proper RWD midsized luxury sedan. I have always thought of the Crown as the Lexus GS's more comfort oriented sister. Hopefully Toyota will continue to make proper Crowns like they have done for the last 66 years. I really dislike how in some markets recently the Crown has become a rebadged Kluger/Highlander."
"> I once read here on Reddit that Tesla’s are luxury cars for people that have never owned or sat in a luxury car before. I think that statement still stands.

This statement is absolutely correct. I went from a heavily modified 2017 WRX to my 2021 Model 3 Performance. There's no contest in terms of comfort. 

I did test-drive a BMW M2, and that definitely is more luxurious than the Model 3 Perf, but I had a bevy of factors to weigh when I made my purchase decision."

As best as my records show, ATF, coolant, and brakes (and brake fluid) are all relatively fresh and won't need work for a couple 10s of thousands of miles.

Edit: Oh!  And I have already replaced the water pump (~90,000 miles), as well as the ignition coil pack and spark plugs thanks to a faulty factory pack (~70,000 miles)."
">	Huge acceleration numbers with electric motors are not that hard to achieve, because electric motors are a lot simpler

Not that simple. For crazy 0-60 yes, but it’s a lot trickier to nail down higher speed acceleration.

Porsche did it with a second gear that added complexity, cost, and weight, and even then it wasn’t as quick at higher speed as ICE cars with comparable power.

That’s why Tesla’s breakthrough with the carbon fiber sleeved electric motors was super impressive. It allowed them to spin the motor to super high RPM without needing a second gear, thus ensuring flat 1000+ hp output for the Plaid all the way to the max speed of the car."
"From a more newbie car enthusiast perspective, I think it provides a good entry point for people who want a further ""sportier"" option that is affordable and still fulfills another utility role. For example, I'm pretty young and can only afford cars within a certain price range, and I have definitely checked out the N type models and considered them along with other sporty cars like an 86, WRX, and the like. Besides like a WRX, the N models Hyundai are affordable and still act as something that can carry a reasonable amount of stuff, unlike a miata for example. 

I think another thing, is that I don't really consider prestige in faster/sportier car. Just give me a fast, nice looking car that drives well, and try to keep it within a reasonable price point. When I get older and more established, yeah, then we can talk about moving up to a supra or something, but they probably won't be made anymore."

"You're still missing the point. 

It doesn't appeal to enthusiasts because it's a bad auto. Not because it's an auto. To use the GTI example, many enthusiasts (including myself) prefer the automatic options because it's a fantastic transmission.

"1st to 2nd shift is a notchy shift. It's not a drag car, and slamming 1st to 2nd can very easily grind.

Comfort mode has the most rev hang. +R has almost none. And if you disable rev match it should get rid of any abnormal rev behavior. Rev match will assist both on upshift and downshift.

You are correct, rev match does weird stuff at low RPM. The only time I really run into it is when I'm trying to stay quiet in my neighborhood. I'll short shift 1st to 2nd and have to manual match into 2nd (1st world problem lol).

That being said, I still SEE the car on a regular basis so as long as it fits the kids and can get them from point a to b every week or two I'm much more concerned with liking the way the car looks in the driveway.

"Obsolete? Eh, maybe.  The problem we get ourselves into here is we act like an SUV should accelerate and handle at near sports car levels without realizing the compromises you make to achieve just that (namely price).  The Bronco doesn't handle well either... hell, nothing that high lifted off the ground handles that well.  And their refresh powertrain (namely the transmission) hunts for gears like there's no tomorrow.  It makes it nightmarish to drive for me.  Does the 4Runners meh 5 speed AT get stuck in weird gears when on a road trip?  Definitely.  Can I live with that over a day in and day out non-stop transmission search?  100%.  Does the V6 lack top end power and acceleration? Definitely.  Do I need to 0-60 launch a 4Runner day in and day out?  Nah.  Do I wish I had an extra oomph to overtake another car on the road?  Sometimes, but it's pretty rare.  But cool, the Bronco can get to highway speeds a little bit faster.  Yay?  All of the other sacrifices I'd need to make to drive a Bronco instead are not worth it to me.  If and when I feel I need the extra power, I'll just throw a blower on it."

"> you could upshift to cause a money shift.

Wouldn't that just cause a stall? Which would be a bit catastrophic at highway speeds, to be fair. Might be more of a hospital shift at that point. Though if you're at highway speeds in a car with a weak engine/transmission wouldn't you already be in the high gears anyway?"
"Oh sure, there are people who reserved S Plaid+ and wanted it delivered. Even as an outsider, I would have been delighted to see the S Plaid+ realized.

But obviously, it's a matter of weighing the costs versus the value of adding another trim level, presumably with different batteries.  (Incidentally, I think there's a remote possibility S Plaid+ will re-emerge as a future product in a year or so when 4680s are more readily available.)

If it's a choice between allocating resources to S Plaid+ or Roadster, I'd personally opt for Roadster."

"I worked for Ford and GM.

You have to keep in mind these companies are massive and the culture can vary even within organizations of the company itself. So ymmv.

These companies typically break down to three major groups. R&D, Product Development, and Manufacturing. R&D being the most laid back but also the most competitive to get into. PD is in between. Manufacturing, I'll be honest, sucks. Every manufacturing engineer I met either would love to leave to the other groups or they just come off as some really miserable people. But it's also the most important group in the company since that's how we get paid. I found many Ford execs had some sort of manufacturing experience so it's incredibly valued when moving up.

I've done PD for both companies (manufacturing experience came during product launch when you may be called to the plant for support). I found overal benefits and 401k to be better at GM. Pay can vary. Fresh out of college grads start with engineering rotational programs (Track - GM and FCG - Ford). It's hard to work your pay up from there. Best way to get big pay bumps is to jump companies every few years. My buddy got $20k pay raise from Ford to GM. My experience with company culture is GM is far more organized, structured but also as a result feels more analytical and cold. At Ford I felt like I was putting out fires everyday with no clear direction but had great comradership. The groups felt less like independent silos and worked better with each other. 

GM facilities (Warren or Milford or Ren Cen) are miles ahead of the Dearborn grounds. Supposedly Ford spent money to renovate but from what I've heard many major engineering building (Bld 1-5) still look like 1980s inside with weird carpet.

Below is just hearsay from others, not personal experience.

Most ex-Chrysler engineers said Ford and GM are better. My coworkers wife said she wants to leave Chrysler for GM because promotions are hard to come by with Stelantis leadership. 

Rivian is very aggressive in hiring right now. They are poaching OEM and supplier employees left and right. I heard their pay and benefits package are incredibly competitive. But rumors are also it is also very start-up like in terms of work-life balance. Which means there isn't any. You're working your ass of there. I've heard one rumors of an engineer from GM getting $160k starting as a senior design and release engineer at Rivian. Fantastic pay for Michigan, but I've also heard they want him to move to California now. Pay is still good for California, but when regular homes are $1mill out there, even that type of pay doesn't seem enough.

Ive heard of two engineers coming back to GM from Rivian after starting a family (GM gives ~3 months of parental leave) and wanting regular 40 hours week days. I heard Tesla is even worse, even working their interns 60-80 hours a week. But these days all those engineers I know going to FAANG+Tesla go there for the high initial pay, work 5 years to get resume padded, and gtfo to get paid just as much for an easier job somewhere else."

"In 4-5 years we might start seeing second gen battery packs from VW Group and Ford. Range could be 300+ miles standard with 800V charging.

Chevy already canceled the Volt. EVs with range extenders are fast becoming obsolete. The only reason to make them is as a compliance car where plug-in hybrids satisfies the regulatory requirement as EVs."
"The problem is that last gen's CLA was not actually competitive with anything, in it's segment or out. Neither was last gen's GLA, though it was slightly less offensive.

You know what they say: you only have one chance to make a first impression. Mercedes used their one chance to release an uncomfortable rattley fwd  subcompact that was outclassed in comfort, performance, and fit and finish by the Ford Fiesta, and who's only market value was the light-up tri-star. If they had released this gen first, no one would be calling it a badge-whore car."
">I'm sure a lot of the ""enthusiasts""

Yeah I'm sure coming out swinging like this has no effect."
"It's implied that you hit the desired gear when up shifting and downshifting.

Money shifting = damage is done (hence money) since you miss the desired/correct gear in favor of too low of a gear, release the clutch all the way and expose the engine to highly excessive RPM."
Owning my Fusion makes me hesitant to buy another Ford.
Yeah for real. The MSRP is around $38k. That’s a pretty good value. Paying anymore than like $43k is insane
"The vertical slats of wood look especially ugly, yea.

I don't like all the screens either, but I accept that they're not going away any time soon."
"I did a money shift one time. I was used to a 6 speed NB miata that a buddy of mine had, and decided to get a 5 speed NA miata. 

Guess where the reverse gear is located on the 5 speed! 

Hint: it makes a really good grinding noise at highway speeds."
"That's reassuring 🥶. Sounds like a dream to me, I love very cold AC"
The EJ25 wasn’t available until 1996 in the Impreza.  I think I’m 1995 they only had the 1.8 and 2.2.
I’m looking at a Maverick for. $27k.  I’d have to go to $35-$40kfor the same features on a ranger.  It’s a big enough difference to make major sales they won’t get with the ranger.

"The Prime is practically an unicorn. It's $40k starting and any dealer that has an allocation for one is throwing a $10k ADM on top of the multi-year long wait.

Definitely the car to get if you can magically get one for MSRP, but Toyota can't produce them very quickly and seems to have no intention of selling more than necessary for regulatory credits."
"It's all part of the process.

Everyone hops, everyone stalls, everyone puts it in the wrong gear. It's not a question of it, but simply when. You'll be a smooth operator in no time.

And then your get a new car and stall it infront of the seller within 3 seconds and try to explain how ""I swear this normally doesn't happen"" and the process repeats."
not a jeep fan but i like the gladiator. the problem is that you have to spend $10k+ aftermarket to make it look decent.
Weird to hear “electric” and “muscle” in the same sentence.
Pair of roller blades where the spare tyre should've been in the boot of the 1980s Ford Falcon Estate we bought in Australia in 2004 for like £300. Discovered when we got a blow out. Forget how we got out of it but we did. Sold it for the same price after we completed our travels. Also included a tent and some pots and pans.
"Those fast minivans are a product of tire technology and (generally) either a fairly powerful V6, a hybrid, or AWD. Or all of the above. 

While 5.6 isn’t blistering fast, it’s quick. Respectable “sporty” cars from not too long ago were in the 6’s, so this time seems a proper evolution for a car that is generally considered “slow car fast”."
Dennis Weaver is incredible in this. It’s one of my favorite movies. I’m talking top 20.

"""Muscle cars"" are mostly about the character of the car, which is something an EV cannot replicate. I can see people arguing otherwise if they're a lot younger or if they've never been around real muscle cars, but as far as I'm concerned, you cant have an EV muscle car. Its a contradictory term."
My car. 09-15 Lancer Ralliart. Why Mitsubishi decided not to offer it with a manual is beyond me. They sold the Evo GSR with essentially the same drivetrain with a manual but the Ralliart was DCT only. I feel like there would be more of them on the road today if there was a manual option.
"Think about it, not only do they have those but they also have the electric f150 and the mach E. I'm the furthest thing from a Ford person, they used to be very meh to me but recently, they've done more than great if you ask me."
"I’m also very curious about the BRZ.  Pre-pandemic, dealerships couldn’t give those cars away, but that was somewhat anchored by the used market prices in the low double-digit range for that car.

Unfortunately, the Z will most likely have a lot of mark up.  Not artificial markup, but the way Nissan uses to do it in the past was this:  although the base 370z started at 29k, the only models on dealers lots would be the sport and touring models, which started around 36k.

That’s the one you want anyway - but I have a sneaking suspicion that if you want to buy an upcoming 2023 Z with a manual transmission and sport trim, you’re going to be looking in the low/mid 50k range."
"god, who would want an S-class with stiffer suspensions"
"I think Ford’s marketing team did far better than they were expecting lol. I wish I had gotten a reservation earlier, but at this point I’m just gonna give it a couple years to work out the kinks. 

On the flip side, Broncos are going to hold their value like crazy for awhile since the demand is so high 

Hope they don’t botch the Lightning launch"

"I don't know why Hyundai didn't release the i30N in the US. Here in Australia it has been moderately popular, but importantly has directly pulled would-be GTI buyers into an i30 instead. I've literally never heard anyone say ""I wish they brought the Veloster here instead"".

And if Hyaundi really thought people wanted a hot sedan with the Elantra, they already had the i30N Fastback which is the best looking N car in the lineup (IMO) and keeps the lift back practicality."

"There's little to no way a new bespoke car using tech Acura/Honda doesn't even presently really have under their belt would work out significantly cheaper than the outgoing model if at all. 

Citing a car that's literally a rebadge from another manufacturer's modular platform doesn't at all support the idea."

I would argue the option cost is what enables Porsche to have so many options.

"VW really did a lot to cater to the mass market and not enthusiasts.

there is a damper/delay valve in the clutch line. the result is a bit more forgiving clutch

Clutch spring mounted to the pedal

There is pretty serious rev hang when shifting from 1st to 2nd

the spring and delay valve resulted in a very forgiving, but highly unpredictable experience."
I think it’s more a function of being able to develop the tech on a low volume vehicle where material costs and reliability are less of a concern and then being able to translate what you’ve learned to volume sellers down the road.
The sport trac was a bastardization of the rollover machine.

The worst manual ever used was a poor clutch and throwout bearing choice on a 95 mustang GT. The auto version feels so much more nimble and the reason it felt uncomfortable as a sports car was how I hated shifting. It took me years later to realize that"

"Found a party sized bag of coke instead of the magazine in a 6-disc CD changer in the trunk of an Acura RL I bought in probably 2005.

Dude that sold the car to me was actually pretty cool.. so I called him to let him know I had it and he laughed and said I could keep it.

Friends and I decided dude needed to be invited over, so he came through w/ a couple other ppl and a good time was had by all. The group that was there that night became like our little party crew for the next few years.

I traded that car for a Ducati 900 SuperSport a few years later and ended up crashing the bike the morning after I got it cause a dude in an oncoming Lambo didn't know what lane lines were for in a blind corner up in Malibu. Fun times.

Edit: Dude brought the cd changer magazine w/ him that night too so, bonus."

"Toiletseat research suggests that creative people seem to be unstable and awful moreso than other people. There's certainly degrees between e.g. John Lennon and Phil Spector but you either apply a zero tolerance to ""misbehaviour"" and ""flaws"" or you accept that they're awful to a point and leave it at that. 

Setting an ""acceptability threshold"" gets weird, since you'd then need to decide that, using the example above, e.g. hitting your wife is a-ok while shooting your girlfriend isn't (since this is Reddit, I'd like to state for the record that I endorse neither behaviour).

Either way, nothing can pry my ears away from Phil Spector's Christmas album when the season comes."

"Early days yet, but based off of my personal experience the Kia dealer I've been working with has been equivalent to, if not better than the BMW dealership I was dealing with for my 335.

I had none of the reported problems of being able to take a Stinger for a test drive.  I also got mine for under MSRP at 0%.  The sales staff were knowledgable, didn't talk down to my wife (which was the only dealership to NOT do that) and there were no attempts at hidden fees or bait and switch.

  The service experience, so far just oil changes I got thrown in with the car, has been adequate.

Dealers are a very local, very hit or miss thing.  If there is a bad manager the whole dealership will be shit."

"Electric


Pros: 

Never have to go to a gas station

Neve have to worry about filling it as long as I'm just commuting (always plug it in at night)

Idgaf how high the gas prices are

Much simpler/less moving parts


Cons:

Roadtrips take longer (but if well planned, even a 1000 mile trip shouldn't add more than 60 minutes vs an ICE car)

Filling up takes longer (but is a non-issue other than roadtrips)

If a storm comes through and we loose power for more than a few days it's going to be a whole lot more inconvenient than having an ICE car

Less range than an ICE car, but it really isn't an issue 99% of the time"

"Fair point. It's not that bad.

The lack of ventilated seats and cheap self-driving stuff hurts a lot with the Germans. But I will say the actual price difference ends up being like 50k vs 55k if you want somewhat equivalent features.

And IMO having actually driven the different options, the Kia punches above it's class, but I'm not sure if it drove better than the S4 or C43. Stinger definitely was behind on the interior department once you get past ventilated seats.

I think if I had looked at the Genesis version I would have been more impressed."

"Type O Negative was never as big as anyone like Pearl Jam or Soundgarden (let alone Nirvana), but Bloody Kisses was Roadrunner Records' biggest-selling album from about 1993 until the early 00s - I think it was overtaken by a Nickelback album around 2002. But Type O (and Peter Steele in particular) was a massively marketable commodity for a while, at least while he had sex appeal and seemed like every dad's worst nightmare. But by the early 00s with nu-metal and whatnot, Steele's shtick seemed pretty tame and Type O was all things considered pretty inoffensive musically (being essentially a mix of Black Sabbath and the Beatles, regardless of how good it was), so the appeal died off. It also didn't help that Steele aged about 20 years in the 00s alone.

They *were* definitely underrated, though. The metal community on the whole figured they were ""goth chick shit"" and the mainstream ignored them, so they never really got much respect until after Pete died. I think good proof of this is that no one has ever really managed to copy them. I've never heard a copycat band that really captures their essence. The guy had a real ear for music and melody that hasn't been replicated, and a voice that is all but impossible to ape. There's a guy on youtube that manages to do the occasional song in the vein of Type O, but apart from him I've never heard anyone who comes close to Steele.

Edit: I saw them live in 2007 and it was admittedly hilariously bad. I was a big fan and was so keen to see them... but Pete barely played, he just kinda hit the bass with a wine bottle every now and then, sang out of time etc. The rest of the band was tight enough but it was a bit of a shitshow. Shame that he sobered up shortly afterwards, only to die."

I don't know what he would have ended up as, but whatever that spark is in Ringo that we all know but can't put our finger on... whether it is acting, drumming or singing I don't know... there is something in him that is projectable and he would have surfaced with or without the Beatles.

"Toyota Supra. 
Audi TT."
"100%

People are just ignorant to what goes in to the production and design of a new vehicle. What toyota did with the new Supra is nothing short of amazing.

I used to own a Supra, was a Supra fanatic in the early 2000s. Mu friend had a 95 turbo and his original Msrp was $52k…. That’s $95k in today’s dollars! The fact toyota brought us a new one for <$60k is actually quite incredible.

And the only way they could do that is sharing the R&D with someone else and I LOVE that it was BMW, they’re the only other mfg I trust to make a straight 6 TT which to me is the hallmark of the Supra itself. 

The alternative is toyota spends hundreds of millions developing their own all new straight six twin turbo that would only be used in one car, it wouldn’t make financial sense, either the new Supra wouldn’t exist or it would cost $90k like it’s supposed to accounting for inflation. People would REALLY bitch then.

Straight six is still my favorite engine, the balance, the unique personality, and BMW makes a damn good one, as a Supra enthusiast I’m honored it’s the heart of the new Supra."

"Seems to depend on the car a lot, my c5 and my rx8 don't have any hang, but the revs drop a lot slower on the c5. It's not bad, but mildly irritating when I switch from the Mazda to the vette. But either way it's nothing like my friends who have Subarus and Hondas. The new WRX has horrendous hang especially on the 1-2 shift, it's bothersome. Hondas seem easier to tune out the hang, had a buddy who did a K24 swap and put a big turbo on it and somewhere in the tuning process lost the hang completely. Subarus on the other hand never seem to get rid of it. Even my buddy's standalone ecu built ej207 bugeye had a little bit of hang in the lower gears and he never could get rid of it, and the situation didn't improve as the cars got newer. 

I've speculated in the past that having a heavy stock flywheel makes it worse, but it's definitely something in the tune that is the root cause."

Honestly what car in it's price range performs better? It performs better than a Golf R and STI on the track
"That's funny, I also considered the Scat Pack. I got it in 2019, so the wide body wasn't out, but the regular one. The Stinger has been great. I love it. I mean, there are things that I could change, but for the money, I'm super happy about it. One thing I would say is that I love the 392 sound and it was one of the major regrets of choosing the stinger over the charger, but after I rented a mustang GT for a week on a trip to see family, I got really sick of the loud V8 droning sound. I'm sure some people are fine or like it, but cruising with a car that makes little to no effort to have sound deadening and a loud engine was not ideal. 

Also, I'm not anywhere near snow, but I lived in the Omaha area for years and knew people who parked their sports cars for the winter. I would imagine that getting a Stinger with AWD would do a lot better. Especially if you got a second set of rims and winter tires. 

For comparing the cars, I would say the stinger feels a little nicer. Like, I would say it's more Buick than Cadillac, but still nicer than Chevy. Kinda that middle their. AWD has been awesome. Like, the numbers aren't as good when you look at the specs on a track, but on wet or sandy roads, It can move a lot faster than 2 wheel drive cars. 

For dealership issues, it's more laziness than anything else. Like, I had a recall, so I scheduled an oil change and the fuse recall to be done at the same time, but when I got the oil change, they gave me the keys and when I paid, they told me they didn't have the parts for the recall. With that, I got an inspection letter saying I was good on everything. The tires are 30k mile tires and I'm around 26k. So when I check them, they need to be replaced soon. Not without tread, but bordering on red on a little tire tread checker. No one has been joy riding my car or done something stupid, it's just a few extra trips and eye rolls. But I figure that is worked into the price. A luxury brand with similar performance and equipment would cost a lot more, so I'm fine with it. 

If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask. I'm sure spending a lot of money on a kia will leave most people hesitant. I was."
"It’s also marketing - the kind of people to pay $200k for something like a GT-R or turbo Porsche are usually the kind of people that either care about stats or care about flexing their wealth.

For these cars, the automatic transmissions provide that extra statistical speed.

With manuals, you’re pretty much capped at 3.5 seconds 0-60 as the absolute fastest.  For example, the hellcat with a manual, even with 700+ horsepower, it’s the same as the c7 corvette at 3.6 seconds.  The Dodge Viper could get up to 3.5 seconds but that’s the fastest (production) manual car in existence, to my knowledge.


Nowadays, even the base c8 can get much faster than that, thanks to the transmission."

Good point; I didn't think of that.
"This is a really good answer. When you get into the cars that are going for the fastest lap times or quarter mile times, you always have in the back of your mind ""I'd be a little faster if I had the automatic"". 

But a TRD Camry is for someone who really wants a practical and reliable car and doesn't care about tenths of second. But they'd like a slightly sportier experience than a standard commuter car."
"What’s funny is these entry level German cars lease really well. I saw a billboard a for a BMW 228 Grand Coupe for $279/month. Yeah it’s FWD, but that’s a really nice car for less than $300/month. Hard to fault someone for going for that.

Now I’ve known a couple of people that lease the $300 BMW and start to think their shit don’t stink. Those people do deserve ridicule."

Here's another fun fact. They wrote it in guitar pro before they could even play the stuff and learned it. So these kids wrote an album that was too technical for them to play and learned how to play it.
"It's a solid album, ran thru n it 4 or 5 times yesterday.  ""Played Out"" almost makes cry at the end. It just goes so fast. I wish we had another couple of songs to finish the story. Maybe a return home, reuniting Juanita with the two kids, them getting a new dog, etc."

"I’m hoping the MK8 Jetta has a much better exterior design than the MK7. As a MK6.5 owner, I feel that they went downhill exterior design-wise from the 6 to the 7. That said, big fan of the interior."
"It depends on the specific implementation of your exact car (locking diff or open/limited) but generally you need to be mindful of keeping the rolling diameter of all 4 corners consistent. Even a few millimeters of tread difference on the same brand tire could overheat or damage a diff.

You can fairly safely use a undersized donut on non drive wheels without much issue but it's not a good idea to do it on driven wheels."
Manual on a street truck is the worst of all worlds. Useful off-road but the maverick isn’t an off-road vehicle.
"You don't lose a cylinder downshifting. Source: about 20 years ago I was accelerating in 3rd in my fiesta xr2i, trying to keep up with a sapphire coswirth. I was doing about 70, when I shifted into 1st. The car immediately sounded like an Impreza, or a boxer engine, idling very rough. A compression test showed only three cylinders were working, an expensive mistake never repeated. I've no idea how the clutch and gearbox survived."
What the Ranger should’ve been.
This 100%. Even right now the Hellcats are slower than other muscle cars like the GT500. Dodge isn’t going to go crazy trying to fight a Hypercar. They just need to focus on building an electric car that feels like a muscle car to appeal to their customers

"The Ranger EV will probably happen in conjunction with the Bronco.  They share the same platform - and more importantly, the same body-on-frame construction.

The Maverick will be much harder to fully-electrify because it’s unibody.  The C2 architecture had to be heavily modified to make the GE1 platform used by the Mustang Mach E."

> Here’s my issue, and this is more of a problem with Genesis, but their dealerships are not set up to sell performance cars

This seems less like an issue of 'being equipped to sell performance cars', and more just *shitty salespeople*.

They probably know the difference, they're hoping you don't or don't care enough to call them on their bullshit. Get you in the door and get you to look at the car even though they know it's not what you asked for and maybe you'll buy it anyways.

The one-and-only time I bought a car new, I ordered it from the factory to get the trim / transmission / color I wanted. A month later, the dealer calls me. ""Good news! The system didn't receive your order, but we actually just got a <trim/transmission> off our truck, but in a different color""

Bullshit dickhead, you guys knew you had this black 6MT coming and that it would sit on your lot forever because no one in this country buys manuals so you didn't put in my order. Don't spin that as good news. I fucking hate sales people lol"

"I want to believe, but 'm not so sure it'll happen - the Mazdaspeeds have yet to appreciate and the last was built eight years ago. I wish it were true. Did Neon SRT and Cobalt SSs ever appreciate? Nope."
"Could they do it? Probably. If you have all the instructions and tools available it's possible to learn and do it. 

Would they? Doubtful. The biggest obstacle is doing something incorrectly and being unable to troubleshoot it. It's tricky enough in a fully functioning car to diagnose an issue as a layperson with no experience. When you're building it from scratch there's multiple things that can go wrong and lots of situations that would fall outside normal guides/diagnosing a functioning car.

Edit: If the internet access included two-way communications, I.e. posting on a forum with experts, or reddit or social media, then probably they could get it done."

"Downshifting is 4 to 2, 3 to 2, etc. It's any downshift.

Moneyshifting is 6 to ""oops I put it in first"" followed by your transmission exploding. Any shift in which the engine will over-rev your transmission past it's limits (and cause damage) is a moneyshift. It's a bad thing."

"Omg the interior is terrible. Mid 2000's Volvo vibes, though that's not fair on Volvo as the plastics at least didn't creak until the warranty ran out."
Not so much with the ranger. It often does have a hard time justifying itself against the full sized trucks especially once the usually full size discounts are applied.
"1.6 stock redline is 7200

However the spark cut on that fuel injection system was kinda inconsistent, so you definitely can hit about 7300-7400 on the 1.6, or at least I can"
"I have a pet theory that someone high up and well connected in Hyundai, possibly the CEO himself or someone in his family, *really* likes the Veloster or came up with the idea of the Veloster, and has been endlessly trying to make the Veloster a successful product, even when it seemed clear just selling the i30 everywhere would have been a more rational decision."

"as a long standing anti-truck kinda guy, as I age I find them more and more useful. 

Ford killed it with the Maverick, IMO, and I'm definitely tempted in a number of years. My GTI with a ruined headliner (1000 dollar repair) speaks volumes to its utility while also getting crazy fuel economy."
"Well, I think Toyota is experimenting with the Crown once again. 

Previously, they experimented with a fastback design to appeal to young people in the 15th generation. However sales started dropping rapidly as the younger people were not able to afford the Crown or were not interested in such a big car. At the same time, usual buyers of the Crown did not like it as it was not as comfortable and luxurious as the previous generation. 

I'm getting kind of shocked and confused that Toyota has not learnt it's lesson of straying too far away from the Crown's formula yet."
Ford vs Ferrari
"I've always been curious about this ""something special"" about air cooled 911s. The new 911s aren't like their predecessors, but Porsche still makes a perfectly driver-oriented car in the Cayman. The base Cayman is about the same weight as a 964, about as powerful, better handling because of the mid-engine, and more comfortable from all the modern improvements without being ""dead"". I've never driven an air-cooled 911 and I'm drawn towards them, but just looking at the numbers it's hard to justify spending $75k for a 30 year old 964 with 100k miles when I can buy a new base Cayman that does all the same things except not depreciate."
"Not a criticism, just honestly wondering but why not just drive the Z06 until you get your blackwing? Like you said it put a smile on your face."
"My old office was full of people driving gen1 Leafs on badly deteriorated batteries. They drove to the office, picked up the kids, and went home. Never exceeded 40 miles in a day, and work had some chargers if needed.

I don't see these flying off the shelves, but as a daily (in a  2 car household, of course), it should do fine. It will come down to the interior, ride, and drive quality compared to cheap EVs to make the premium argument."
"Toyota should learn from GM and see what happened when they made the Holden Commodore a FWD Opel. I seriously hope that if the Crown does arrive in North America, it comes as a midsized luxury sedan, regardless of if it is branded as a Toyota or Lexus."

Yup. Got a chance to drive a Model S 100D back a few years ago and was throughly unimpressed by everything but its straight line speed. Its QC and material use was nowhere near it 5 series or A6 asking price.

"Gasoline/petrol for my F150 5.0L.

I'm sure I'll catch flack for this but I put 93 octane in it ""it only calls for 87"" but in newer vehicles that can alter their own timing on the fly there is a slight performance gain by running higher octane fuel, aside from that I just makes me feel better to use higher quality fuels and oils in my vehicles.

I've used E-85 a couple of times in it and it definitely felt like it increased low end torque a little bit, even over 93, but my gas mileage suffered greatly for it. I lost about 5mpg on a average on E-85 vs 93."
Bc younger buyers will get that. Then they upgrade to suv with fam over the GS.
"It isn't really a 100% car/driving movie, but I really liked Logan Lucky.

"Underrated band. Check out Diorama, an absolute gorgeous album. There are a few documentaries on the making of it on YT. I love a good music doc, and this is really fascinating. Daniel, the singer, has had some really brutally unlucky health issues over the years which meant they couldn't tour, otherwise I reckon Diorama would be held in the same regard as something like Tame Impala's ""Currents""."
Yeah I love that bit of trivia
Mr. Big is the very definition of “label band”.
"I have had my C8 for a while now and I love it. I think it really does live up to its hype, it’s an affordable mid engine car with amazing performance. I have 8k miles on it now and I can sell it for $20k over what I paid and as much as I love the car I do contemplate that constantly. 20k is a lot of money and I could just put in an order for another c8 after. 

To comment on it having no soul, there is some truth to that. It does feel numb at points, I honestly prefer tracking my STi over the C8 for many different reasons. However, it is an incredible car that I and anyone else I let drive it would say lived up to its hype."

I guess having a very-visibly-red interior is fine for subtle colors, but combining it with the eye-popping floors like the Grabber hues or Twister Orange is sensory overload or something?  Either way, it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth when one of the Mustang’s selling points is supposed to be that you can have one your way."

I emailed them, Kerbeck, and Criswell, asking about the whole process of ordering (as this isn't only my first allocated Corvette, but my first new car purchase all together), and Macmulkin was the only one who actually responded with what to expect through the ordering process, stuff when it's time to pick it up, what my options were at that point, etc. They seemed the most up front, and welcoming to a first time buyer. Definitely a long wait for sure. even after a month, I'm still at 1000th in line (my spot was secured early July, and they only had 60 allocations move since then), so hopefully Fall 2022 does happen."
"I think we have to be careful with the word ""better"".  To be clear... when it comes daily driveability and even performance capabilities the modern 911's are way ahead of any air cooled car.

Where the air cooled cars are better are in regards to DRIVING EXPERIENCE.  The earlier 911's were focused being a sports car and due to the lack of ""extra crap"" in the car the driver could be really connected to the driving experience.  The compact size... handling traits and especially air cooled engine really added to the character of the car and driving enjoyment.

While the newer water cooled 911's got more refined, luxurious and pleasant to drive daily... every step Porsche made to make the 911 more refined actually made the car less exciting and thrilling to drive.  That's why people like the air cooled so much... you are so much more connected to the car and driving experience.  But I bet you if a person had to daily drive a 911... most would much rather have a watercooled one."

"The problem is that they don't make a two wheel drive , 4-cylinder, 2 door ""work version"" so like the Honda Ridge line they start at $35,000 rather than $25,000 and will always be on the rarer side of things."

"On the opposite hand. BMW E60 M5 auto. The V10 is still one of the best sounding engines over 5000rpm, however the SMG gearbox hasn't aged well, it's an automated single clutch manual transmission. The shift times are unbelievably slow and cut power for the duration"
"Personally I think the best rebuttal to that stupid joke is the song ""In My Life"". Ringo's drumming is *so* understated, but perfectly pulls the song together."
"Charlie was such an incredible drummer. He always provided just what a song needed. In memoriam, go listen to the [drum fill](https://youtu.be/6U8JlcB_BzA) and transition at 3:01 in Tumbling Dice. One of my favorite drum moments in all of music."
Yep their self titled it was their first roadrunner release(MFKR was technically their first but that album sounds nothing like their next.) It was the first RR to go platinum. Type O and Machine Head definitely legitimized the label and set the stage for them.

"Umm, me?!? Seriously with COVID my wife and I chose to reduce our vehicles to a quantity of “1” because we just don’t commute anymore. We use a Civic EX-L hatch coming off of owning a robust amount of exotic and sports cars for many years.

My wife finds the Civic to be atrociously boring, and the only extremely affordable peppy (like actually fast) but usable cars on the market right now is the N division in Hyundai. Her and I are very much interested in the Kona N because we live in the South so AWD is meaningless to us, it gives great usability and utility and will have a good sound and speed out of the box that literally NO ONE ELSE offers. Not a single other affordable CUV is out there that is designed to be fun to actually use daily.

The Model Y is the closest at $50k and that’s not what I consider affordable. And despite TESLA claiming a push to get EVs to the “affordable” mass market all they’ve done in 2021 is raise their pricing on all products and software - capitalism is starting to bite back at their methodology. 

The truest problem with N is that Hyundai dealers are ruining them - I’ve seen insane OTDs of $45-50,000 for DCT Veloster Ns and what’s crazier is people are buying them - look at Autotrader there’s all of maybe 30 left in the US likely with $25k markups. 

EDIT: New winner - Hyundai asking $65k for a Veloster N https://imgur.com/a/QFMjvBT

And if you don’t think N is successful it’s literally the only part of Hyundai that has gotten them incredible press in the last 3 years with winning Car of the Year and constantly being held in the highest of praise for being the one car that actually is trying to revive the enthusiast market of old “Honda CRX” replacements by offering a peppy hot hatch.

I just wish America could get the actual 4DR i30N rather than the awkward 3dr - it would sell like bananas in the states and or the fastback N which looks incredible. We just don’t get the cool ones here in the states.

But mark my words the Kona N will be a ludacris hit for young adults starting families having to get rid of their 2seater sports cars and wanting something with utility but also is still actually enjoyable to drive Manual and DCT options like who else is offering DCT at this price point besides the GTI? No one, it’s incredible! 

Look comparatively- the Veloster N and the 2.0L Supra run near EXACT spec paper times on every single number...except Hyundai gives you a hatch, back seats, a manual, 100k mile warranty and an out of the box fun car that needs no mods, not even an exhaust. 

The Kona N doubles down on all of the above with MORE practicality and still hits all the same numbers as the 2.0L SUPRA.

The Supra is 14!!!! Thousand dollars more expensive and offers so very little.

The real question is who the hell is actually buying Toyota sports car products as their insane prices for value the whole POINT of the partnerships with other brands was to make the cars cheaper to produce and yet you can get a Better experience than the 2.0L Supra from Hyundai for $14000 less.

To me the N division is the biggest win Hyundai’s ever had, and my god they needed it, now if they could just get rid of their shady shit dealers and allow us to buy direct we’d have a revolution."

"Only when manually shifting it though. When it's in full automatic mode, the lag time to kick down even in sport mode was abysmal. Highway passing was a joke most of the time because by the time the transmission decided to downshift, the gap was long gone. It drove me crazy, to the point where I would manually downshift every time I wanted to pass someone. My ancient P38 Range Rover with its 4-speed slushbox kicks down a million times faster than the Panamera ever did (as did my previous, non-Callaway P38).

But on a mountain road, with that PDK forced into manual-shifting mode and sport mode turned on, and the PASM in sport plus...that boat was far better than it had any right to be."

"I know this topic gets beaten to death, and that there’s a myriad of different reasons why GM didn’t offer it, but I’m really salty that the c8 doesn’t come with a manual transmission.

It would have gone from “one of the best cars of the 2020s” to literally “one of the greatest cars of all time, ever.”

I chose my c7 over the c8 specifically for the 7MT, and as a whole, it’s a much more fun and dynamic car to drive.

But I still wouldn’t mind the mid-engine layout and the attention that the c8 gets.  I just can’t justify spending all that money on a c8 as a “weekend toy” without that extra level of engagement (I’m not a race car driver so I’m not worried about tracking my car. I just like to blow of steam on weekends so that kind of engagement is what I’m looking for).

I have a feeling that in the near future when all cars are electric and super fast, the c8 will lose just a *bit* of its novelty, while the manual sports cars will be more coveted."

Wait..what did Ted do?
It's only real competitive edge is that most EVs in this price range are econobox interiors. If it is nice inside and good on NVH there is a case to be made since cars like the Bolt are notoriously cheap inside. Mazda also should have access to full state+federal credits as Nissan and GM run out.
And your axe
"Is the M8 different mechanically in any way from the M5? I don't really understand why it's tens of thousands more. Sure the styling isn't quite as fancy but the tech and driving experience are the same as far as I can tell. The old M6 used to be quite close in price to the M5.

Could get an M5 with the all of the mods from this car for less than the price of a stock M8 Comp."

"minivan is the way to go, more space than suv and usually better gas mileage"
"VTEC made engine slightly interesting, even if mostly for sound"
"Agreed. IMO it's actually a perfect use case for a vehicle like this. Less maintenance means less driving many miles to the dealer. EV means you don't have to drive many miles to a gas station or deal with maintaining your own tank/pump with delivered fuel, plus the fact many ranches are going solar which reduces opex even further. Battery pack means it can also serve as a power source out in the back 40, etc."

"I’m a car dealer....  let’s see.  Best story I have is I bought a repossessed S500 about 20 years ago from MB Financial at an auction and drove it back from the sale (car I brought with me ran that day and sold).  On the way back I had a blowout so I stopped and put the spare on.  Car was shak8ng violently with the spare and the car wasn’t that old so I drove back gently.

Next day my mechanic orders a couple new Michelin’s and starts breaking the wheels down.  The spare had 2 kilos of cocaine hidden in it.

Mechanic panics, calls the police, I come back from lunch and it looks like they’re filming cops at the lot.  Turns out the previous owner lost the car because he was in prison for trafficking."

"More gears means you can stay in the powerband easier by having to drop less RPMs for the next  higher gear. This means as it shifts into a higher gear, the engine will be closer to peak power. You are not increasing the performance of the engine, you are increasing the efficiency of using that power.

Lets say we have an 200 hp engine has the following powerband:

2000 RPMs - 60 HP

3000 RPMs - 90 HP

4000 RPMs - 120 HP

5000 RPMs - 160 HP

6000 RPMs - 180 HP

6500 RPMs - 200 HP

If you have a 4 speed transmission, red line it to 6500 RPMs and after shifting the RPMs are down to 4000 RPMs, then you go from 200 hp to 120 hp.

Now if you have an 6 speed transmission, red line it to 6500 RPMs and after shifting the RPMs are down to 5000 RPMs, then you go from 200 hp to 160 hp.

Finally if you have an 8 speed transmission, red line it to 6500, and after shifting the RPMs are down to 6000, then you go from 200 hp to 180 hp.

You will loose some time from shifting so many times but you stay in the RPMs that make so much more power that it is quicker even while you have to shift more"
Just listened to it this morning. What a damn good album.
"I don't think it's malicious - I think the assumption is that you have those other things (like most people) AND the nice cars, that's all. But I do find it hilarious when people think I'm extravagant driving my 14 year old Lexus because I keep it clean and looking like new haha. That thing is worth like $5k at this point"
"that number decreases as price goes up. gt3 is an exception because it's a rare production limited car that even collectors go after. The main reason was because bmw never made a manual for the i6 z4, so toyota didn't want to make a custom one"
"No, the z4 already had the newest revision of the engine on release. There was no big conspiracy. BMW just didn’t supply bmw with the higher output engine the first year. Once they gave them the newest one, it equaled all the other bmw products. The 2020 engine was definitely a slower engine, though still badass."

"I wrote this big ass comment in response to someone else's that got deleted, and yours was the most similar so I'm post it here:

Ecoboost Mustang and GT86 run Tsukuba Circuit a hair over half a second apart from each other, and the Mustang is ~4 seconds faster on the Hockenheim Short layout, according to fastestlaps.com times. Times aren't everything I know, and I haven't spent a ton of time in either car because I don't get to drive the stuff on the lot much, but in my experience the Mustang doesn't feel as big as the weight suggests. I was a little surprised when I saw the number just now actually. 

 Obviously people will have a preference one way or the other (that's why both cars exist, after all) but segmenting cars down to the point there's only 2 cars available in a given category is too much imo. Everything is trying to carve a spot for itself and sometimes the lines get blurred between sports car, gt, performance coupe, whatever.

They aren't light, I'll agree, it's about 1000 lb heavier than the 86, but they are similarly matched performance wise. I was just throwing it out there because they are in the same price/performance bracket, and have a hell of a lot more in common than they have differences."
"That's a actually a pretty neat commercial ngl. I don't know if they purposely left that in to hint at a manual or if they just put it in to look cool though. Same way F&F series has them switching like 20 gears when they race just because it's the cool thing to do on film or whatever. 

I just said what I know so far, which is that they aren't planning. I do also know that Toyota wants real performance oriented incremental improvements on the Supra every year to keep buyers coming back. A manual next year would definitely have everyone lining right up."

"Test drove a Jetta before getting into my Sonata, and was amazed by the outgoing 1.4T. It's not a lot of power, but the torque is all available down low so it still feels pretty peppy, and you didn't have to do dramatic, multiple-gear downshifts to get a little passing power. On top of that, you'd see 40MPG highway with the manual! I bet the 1.5T will be even better."
"Right so you won't define grunge but you'll determine what it isn't because you were there. Seems like gatekeeping.

I'm not talking about rock crawling or anything crazy either, just that I prefer mechanical AWD as you don't have to worry about exhausting the charge and losing the RWD half of AWD, and also that none of the power from the front can transfer to the rear of the separate motor pack in an eAWD setup. It isn't that the Rav4 setup is bad, but just that I prefer a mechanical setup."

"What generation M3 are we talking about?  Short of catching one flat footed, an E90/F80 M3 is a second faster through 60 and the quarter. A manual car would be much more up to the driver but if they were proper racing, it wouldn't exactly be that close.  

'15+ Charger RT is \~5 seconds to 60 car which is comparable to the R-Spec and the older '11 F10 550i.  A 392 car is probably a second faster.

"Yea, probably the white one doing a 10.96 and a black one doing 10.79, both cars were identical as to what was removed/done to them, but the black one added WMI. So its a feasible outcome. The fact that they're trapping 125-128mph would indicative of a 3300lb cars making 435-465whp. Both were shop cars, so they obviously tuned them for days and weeks on end and had pro drivers.

"> That may be the case at the moment, but Ford doubled (tripled?) production estimates once already

That happened because SK’s lawsuit with Samsung ended up being resolved favorably for the former.  Prior to that, Ford had to plan for limited production because SK was facing the possibility of being banned from setting up shop in the US and only allowed to import a certain quota of cells per year.

> I don't understand how you're so confident they won't do so again. They're a massive company and it's years away. 

Firstly, it isn’t Ford that’s the bottleneck here.  It’s their battery supplier.  SK Innovation is a giant company in their own right, but their battery business is much smaller than that of rivals like Panasonic or Samsung because they hadn’t secured a mass production contract prior to the Lightning.  That means they need to undertake a massive expansion of their own to catch up, which they are doing - they announced a $26.5 billion, 5-year expansion plan about a month ago.

Secondly, I don’t know what reality you’re living in, but Q1 2022 is 3 months and a week away.  The Lightning is scheduled for launch sometime in that quarter, so at most there is 6 months left."

This is a GL**A**. Along with the X1, Q3, and NX are the ones that overlap very much with top trim economy/premium, especially since they're FWD platforms. Top trim Mazda still leads the field on FWD-derived sport-luxury (which is why it always comes up in these threads), but if you don't obsessively prioritize sportiness over everything else, the GLA or Q3 are probably better picks for the typical consumer of these products (comfort and a very obvious nice badge)."

Ford played it save and now they are going to have to ramp up production significantly over the next few years. But at least it knows it can sell those cars.

"The NSX never, from its first generation, led the world in performance. It was always 911 Carrera money for 911 Carrera performance but with a special driving experience and superb reliability. Basically bringing to reality what the sports car was advertised to be. 

Honda are among the very best manufacturers in the world. Tesla is more than a couple categories below them in production expertise and sports car know how. Honda knows how to make a car drive great and stand the test of time. So Honda could certainly deliver on a car with way better reliability, build quality, driving experience, all for less money than the roadster II. Or put another way, it’s plausible that the gen 3 NSX is simply a repeat of gen 1 albeit to a smaller degree. 

You might say, but 3mtibor, you don’t understand how important speed is! It would be slow and wouldn’t sell well in the end! I never said it would sell great: the original NSX is seen much more fondly today than it was by the market back when it was in production. But that doesn’t change what Honda can deliver and may not even change how much Honda cares."

Giulia 2.0 turbo. I believe it’s in the jeep Cherokee but paired with the ZF transmission it’s an amazing drive
"My car is professionally tuned to 92 octane so it has to have premium in my state.  Tuning to the bleeding edge gets me some benefits, but you have to plan for driving out-of-state.  I have 4 different maps in my Accessport, so I can drop it down to a conservative ""ECO"" tune that will limit boost and keep a box of octane booster in the car if I need to drive somewhere with crappy fuel."

"The entire Tesla Lineup. It's beyond a ""simple"" interior design they are just straight up boring, they aren't that comfortable, that aren't that spacious, the exteriors are super plain, the company itself is just a burning cash fire, and the only thing they have going is that they're electric. At this point people just buy them for the brand name. Somehow their stock price keeps going up to? It's so weird. For the price there are hundreds of other cars that are far better in every way, and for electric cars there are others that are the same price or less new that are so much nicer and more comfortable. I just don't understand the hype 😂"
"Oh yes, I got 34mpg often. I think the average was pretty consistently 32. Pretty ridiculous you can have 500hp and a car that gets that with a V8. The Type R won't do that, much less any other performance car. My fuel range indicator would state I'd have 720km or so of range on a full tank."
"Hmm, I guess yea"

"This was back in 2018 when I was seriously looking, but $15k back then would buy you either a Kia Soul or maybe an Elantra in my area in terms of newish used cars. You could of course buy older vehicles, but there’s no real point in comparing 5-6 years old vehicle with a brand new ones."
"My friend who's raced said he liked the quiet / slow-motion-feeling scenes ford vs ferrari had when the cars were on the fast straights, said that described the feeling of speed better than any other racing movie."
Nothing I said is inaccurate. You think they're going to be investing anything into ICE cars?

"When my brother was 24 he bought a new 2005 Mustang GT with all the bells and whistles.  

At the time he was working as a cashier earning 7 bucks an hour and working 30 hours a week.  He also had no credit history and did not negotiate so they took him for a ride financially.  His payments were over 600 a month.

He also hated the poor mpg so he ended up not even driving it most of the time, he would walk to work instead.

Ended up selling it less than a year later with my mom bailing him out and eating 10k in the process."

"For example - the Maverick will fit in my current garage, but any other truck with proper 4 doors will not (save for the Hyundai Santa Cruz). Granted there are other reasons I'm interested in a small truck like this, but it is part of the equation where even a modern Ranger/Tacoma won't make the cut for me. Let alone a full size."
"The screens have massive problems.

Father of a friend bought a brand new model X. Screen stopped working completely 2 times (they had to visit Tesla to fix it). Screen will sometimes simply shut off during driving (incl. the instrument cluster), Tesla say they can't fix it.

They are also on the 4th. set of axles (due to the geometry of the control arms being off I think)"

This is incorrect; the first-gen Tundra was 218,"" while nearly all Tundras from 2007-on have been 229"". 11"" is not ""nearly two feet"". If you compare the extra-long Double Cab/8' model (248""), then the difference is two and a half feet, but those trucks aren't exactly common.

It's also important to note that the first-gen Tundra, despite Toyota's insistence, wasn't quite a full-size truck even in its time; it was noticeably smaller than any of the Big 3's full-sizers."

"They fucked up several things there.  Pricing was the main one.  At $10k, it was never going to be popular.  Their argument was that they had to use insane bulletproof engineering and manufacturing because if people got hurt on them, they’d be liable. 

Turns out that was a bad assumption.

They also built a facility to produce them that was about 1000x too big, based on some offhand comment that the postmaster general would buy a lot of them.  So that increased the cost for basically no reason, too.

They also ended up with a super high dork factor and low fun factor, which was also their fault.  Again they were worried about liability, but they never marketed it as a fun thing, never gave it to celebrities or young people, etc.  so it turned into a dorkmobile, and that was the end of it. 

I think they were actually visionary that personal, motorized transit in a small envelope would be popular in cities, they just really botched basically every aspect of it beyond that."

"> Now I maybe nuts but who goes into a Hyundai dealership and goes OMG I have to have have a Nurburgring tuned Kona.

I think that's a bit naive.

Obviously the CUV / SUV market has been going gangbusters for quite some time. And companies have started putting spicy versions of these new hot selling categories. Dodge Durango Hellcat, F-150 Raptor.

I don't see a Kona  N or any other spicy non-traditionally spicy car as something that attracts a CUV buyer cross shopping a Rav4 and decides to get the N version, it's more about taking the buyer that would be going for a sedan and compromises onto a CUV as long as its got the get up and go.

Like an RS6 Avant - do you think this is targeting wagon buyers to just spend a few extra $$, or is it convincing new RS6 buyers that yes they can have vrrmm vrrmmm AND the practicality of a wagon in one.

If your Kona is obscure, and they release an N version and we're talking about it.... job done eh?"

"The early 00s Ford Thunderbird. My dad bought his new in 02 on his way up to Cape May with my mom for around 41k, dealerships only got 12 and had them marked up 5-10k. By some miracle the salesman happened to be a customer from my dad's online business so he offered it for MSRP without the mark-up. But my dad was telling me how hyped everyone was about that car, so hyped in fact someone walked in right after he signed the paperwork and asked about buying my dad's new car and the dealer had none left in that color and spec.

But beyond the styling (""modern classic"") the car was an absolute wheezing dog of a land yacht. Horrendously slow, handled like the USS Nimitz, electrical problems, a *very* cheap early 2000s Ford interior, and just not really that fun to drive with the roof on. My dad never really was a ""Car guy"" he just bought whatever he thought was appealing to him. It's funny how overhyped that car was and how worthless they became shortly after. I however have noticed a few on CaB and BaT with very low miles going for okay money, and there is one currently going for around 23,000. 

Definitely overhyped in my opinion"

"I think another factor being overlooked is the character of the car. By most accounts, the Veloster N has a lot of character compared to the CTR. I think that should come into the picture with these comparisons as well, it's a big reason why I personally don't particularly care for something like the GTI and the reason the Veloster N appeals to me in the first place. That being said, I don't have any experience driving the Veloster N, but that comes back to the dealer network complaints you see elsewhere in this topic."

"I believe there is some rev hang for emissions. But with rev matching on, it holds the rpms for a bit when upshifting. While driving if you press the clutch and don’t select a gear you can see it in action. The rpms will stay for a second to allow you to shift and then start dropping quick after"

"Peter Steele from Type O Negative was a pretty shitty guy before he died but damn did they make unique music. If they weren't so unique, maybe I could find someone to replace them when I want to listen to Type O Negative, but I just have to forget about what he said outside of the music. It's not like he was saying that shit in the lyrics"

They both suffer in comparison to the 1971 Le Mans. A lot of it filmed during the actual race.  Real Porsche 917s and real Ferrari 512s screaming down the Mulsanne Straight.  Nothing else comes close.
The TLXS got way too big and gained way too much weight.  That powertrain would have been great in the previous chassis.

"This. 

If they had brought either of these cars to the US, I almost certainly would have bought one over my '18 CPO GTI Autobahn. 

Don't get me wrong, I love my GTI, but those 2 Hyundais looked so sweet."
"JayEmm On Cars is worth checking out too, very down to earth and reviews a lot of attainable / regular enthusiast cars"
The first time I ever went to a concert in England it was UB40. I will never forget that day. Goodnight sweet prince.
Peter was a true entertainer for sure.
50k will get you a new 3 series. It will also get you a ct4 but you'll probably want to spend more for the ct4-v.

"[Hell, even a family crossover looks more composed than this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1FIPXeU7J0)"
"Yup same LT4 but with almost 670 HP.  It won't be practically much faster. The CTS-V3 is lightning quick and the limiting factor is mostly having rear wheel drive.  You'll get a tenth here or there.
However, they did improve a lot of the components of the car so it will be a better car.
The only thing they part in part out changed from what I have learned is the 10 speed transmission so I'm really curious what that's like.  The 8 speed in the V3 was lightning quick in shifts and great in automatic  but had a 1/4 delay when you used the paddles and I've heard of some people complaining about some issues on the forums that I haven't experienced."
But then what do you put in the newly installed gas tank? And what is the range of one tank if you did manage to fill it?

"I don't daily the car but the hatch space is very good for a compact car like the Civic.

Obviously the Type R is lacking in features that would make it questionable as a daily vs something like a Touring trim Civic. There's no heated seats or steering, no auto dimming mirrors, no cross traffic alert or other safety features. You can still daily it, its comfy enough, the seats are quite bolstered and getting in and out is like getting into/out of a bucket seat so if you need to do this frequently it might be annoying."

He was on a track with The Weeknd that hit [#2](https://www.billboard.com/music/the-weeknd/chart-history/FRA/song/1196054) on the billboard charts last year so while there still probably isn't anyone under 60 going out to grab the latest Kenny G solo album he's still out there making music that the kids are listening to, even if they don't know it's him or who he is."

We didn't make it out to any of the islands unfortunately. We stayed in Bailey's Harbor and went out from there and I would go back in a heart beat. I thought it was a great trip - we're new midwest transplants from Boston and Door County reminded me a lot of Cape Cod; super cute area
"That then shouldn't *really* be case for failing, as you were just trying to be safe, definitely saw that kind of action required in the traffic.

I had a funny case when I passed, or rather after I passed, some guy with his daughter came to me and thanked me because his daughter kinda got lost on a roundabout (they put people on 3 lane roundabout with lights and trams) and just followed me"
"Idk man, I can list a handful of vehicles I’ve never encountered issue with. The Altima doesn’t make that list ever."
"Well, yeah it’s a consumer sports car.  You literally buy it for the emotions.

Nobody is breaking motorsports records on a production car in the first place."
But a company can choose to update a car. It doesn’t make my comment wrong.
The whole point of buying a GTI is to beat people in races because your transmission is better. But now more DCTs are out there so it lost its edge
"34 mpg on the highway? Are you serious? It looks like the tank capacity is 18.5 gallons, so we're talking potentially 600 mile range. As someone who wants to get a C8 to use it as a grand tourer, this makes me want to get one even more."
"
 Comparing the FWD options - 

* CTR is rated at ~300hp for ~$37k 
* Veloster N is 275hp for ~$32k 
* GTI is 228hp for ~$30k

I've seen a few comparisons of them, and again, the Veloster N isn't a bad car, it just doesn't do anything to sway me to Hyundai.

I don't think there's a great reason to buy the Supra, and they're not doing anything to sway me to purchase one either."
"“Surf’s Up” by The Beach Boys.

I just need to actually sit in a Maverick and see how cheap the interior feels compared to the Santa Cruz. If it uses the same cheap plastics as the EcoSport I won't be able to tolerate it.

"My base model 2009 Hyundai accent with a Manuel transmission and probably less than 100 hp was quite fun to drive, or so I thought when I was 18 years old driving a brand new car with a stick."
"A daily means, well, you drive it every day. Thats it, everyone has different needs. I don't need 4 seats or the need to carry a lot of stuff so if I did commute, a C8 would be perfect for me or any coupe really that was comfortable and wasn't a pain to park. 

To you it needs these things, thats great if you need an all in one car. Some people have more then one car so they don't need to have 1 that does everything and therefore those people could daily their second, possibly less practical vehicle to work if they wanted to like many owners of Corvettes and 911s do."

I’m just happy the GLI continues to live on. The GTI is great but the more offerings in the market the merrier. Plus this fits things like golf clubs and hockey sticks easier than the GTI. Would love to see a Jetta R though.
That would’ve been brilliant lol
I’ve had some lyrics take years to write and others that I’ve worked out completely in one shower. Depends on the inspiration for me. The thing I noticed is that good lyrics insist upon themselves. The come when they’re ready.
"The auto is excellent (ZF8), and it does have a manual option outside the US, but the Alfa Romeo Giulia is just begging for a _good_ manual option. I've read that the manual they do offer is pretty lackluster, but the steering and suspension feel is incredible, and if they could also bump the rev limit another 1k or so, ~320hp would be absolutely perfect in that chassis with a sharp 6 speed manual."
They’re great?

I didn't bring up the Supra to say the 86 will get a horsepower bump. Just saying Toyota is withholding some easy improvements that they'll roll out in later model years. That could take a lot of forms.

You mean, like there's still no large-scale plan to roll out charging stations nation-wide and that our power grid can't currently handle the increase in usage? And what's the long term viability of the batteries? 8-10 years from now, are junk yards going to be filled with EV's that have to be disposed of because the batteries can't be replaced, or are cost-prohibitive to replace?

A handful of token EV charging stations doesn't solve anything on a large scale basis. Also, removing the tax incentives, EV prices likely won't be cheaper than ICE"

"I'm guessing it's going to end up being called the Dart (although that name has been used in recent years, a muscle car would bring it a bit closer to its roots.

Other names they might consider: Coronet, Daytona, or Barracuda.  But to me, Dart is the clear best option (assuming they're going to use a classic muscle car name and not come up with something new... but IMO that would be a terrible choice for a retro-styled EV muscle car)."

"I really don't like the front end on this. Well, mostly the ""grille"" It's awkwardly small and looks like they just took the corporate Mazda grille and then shrink it vertically until it just fit the logo. Woulda been better without it.

"Nobody pays capital gains on a car profit like that, the government has no way to know about it or how much you made.

If I bought a car and flipped it for $1000, I'm not going to report it, nobody does. Now if you've legit sold that many C8s for that much profit each in the span of a year, maybe you'd need to do something as thats a large influx of cash but in general selling one vehicle and coming out ahead isn't going to set off any flags anywhere, again they have no way of knowing what you made on the car, especially if its a straight up trade in on another car. How do they know what you bought the car for originally, what if that car had a trade in as well that changed the numbers? discounts etc? its a giant mess and the cost isn't reported to the government."
"Yes and I would say the Evora has a tuned up family sedan engine in it. It’s not a negative negative just because the engine isn’t exotic. Like the Miata, one of its biggest advantages is it’s reliability and low running costs."
"I've seen savagegeese speak very positively of hyundai/kia products, particularly some of the lower end ones.

"Sure, but that's also the market that has the Honda E, and the MX-30 pretty much matches that spec for spec. There's 40k+ preorders for the E, so I assume these kind of low range EVs are just a better market fit there."

"I want to separate the artist from the music but by listening to their music, buying their tickets, etc you are putting money in their pockets and being apart of the fan base which is supporting the person who did those acts. I want to just say “it’s just music. Do whatever” but sometimes I just can’t rock with abusers, rapers, racists and bigots even if they do make the best album or my favorite. I’ll give them all the credit they deserve for their music/craft but I’ll do my best to not further support them."
"But that’s exactly why modern automatic transmissions suck. Every one is used to never ever replacing the fluid. 

Nearly every modern transmission by today’s standard has REQUIRED fluid maintenance. Like on the vws if you skip the fluid change it pretty much guarantees the transmission is going out.

"I actually think ""hot"" CUVs make a lot of sense - they have more potential for good sales than hatchbacks, at least. I've probably seen more Explorer STs and Edge STs than Focus STs and Fiesta STs, despite the latter being better driver's cars.

The problem is that it's the *Kona.* I don't know the sales numbers, but I'd guess Hyundai sells a hell of a lot less of those than Tucsons or Santa Fes or Palisades. Introducing a Tucson N along with the new Tucson would have made a lot of sense. Or even a Santa Cruz N - maybe no one would buy it, but it would get a lot of media attention."

"For this size of pickup, going to BOF wouldn't help its payload and tow ratings all that much. Yes, historically, BOF vehicles could haul and tow more than unibody vehicles, and it's still true of mid-size and larger trucks, but when it's a compact, the difference would be negligible at best, and might even hurt them if it increased the vehicle's curb weight. A full frame would also rob interior passenger space, and raise bed height."

"There's a big grey area, I'm a hypocrite when it comes to people like David Bowie and Prince (and Jimmy Page) because I just love their music too much, but their whole 'sex with underage women' thing definitely is not ideal towards their legacy. And you can't necessarily just write it off with the whole 'it was a different time thing'. But when not being able to listen to Purple Rain, Sign o the Times, Low, and Station to Station are at stake, it's not as easy. I personally can't do it, so I don't criticize people who enjoy other proclaimed 'shitty' artists

For people like Kanye West (where ego and politics seem to be his biggest sin) it's incredibly easy for me to set aside that and enjoy the great music.

People like Chris Brown and R Kelly who have definitely  proved themselves to be irredeemable pieces of shit I have no problem not listening to their songs. 

MJ is difficult bc no one really knows if he really did it or not and it's such a big dispute. 

The Morrissey/Smiths thing is easy for me to overlook, I ignore the douche and just enjoy Johnny Marr and company's virtuosic musicianship."

"> it's just bizarre they didn't N-ify the sonata/elantra/Santa Cruz before their unknown models.

Alternatively, ""Suck"" by The Wedding Present.

You do you.
"Just to give you a bit more info. Ali left the band in 2008 citing management issues. Basically the band members were being shortchanged by management and Ali had had enough, when he approached the band with it and they weren't willing to do anything he left. 

The original UB40 members stayed together and his brother (whom was never a part of the original lineup) took his place as lead singer. Given that the band name UB40 isn't copyrighted due to it being a government  document, Ali was able to use the name and when Mickey Virtue (keyboardist who left the band a few years after Ali after seeing the same problems) and Astro followed, they performed and released as UB40 ft. Ali, Astro and Mickey until Mickey retired and they now perform as UB40 ft. Ali and Astro. 

The 'other' band performed as UB40 throughout all this time using the name which is well associated with the voice of Ali. leaving many fans disappointed when they turned up expecting Ali. Duncan (Ali's brother who replaced him as lead singer) retired recently due to ill health and the lead singer of the 'original' UB40 lineup is now Matt Doyle.

Quite an interesting history and worth a look in to. Ali has done a few interviews where he talks about the bands troubles which tell more of the story!"

Probably because Ford keeps bastardizing the Mustang name when they advertise it to distract from the fact that it's a crossover/minivan thing like the model X/Y.
But I'll still be trying to figure out what the fuck rhymes with bronco.
"Not really…. The engine block and crank shaft would be pretty hard to make.  Casting a block requires a lot of knowledge and/or trial and error.  If you weren’t a metallurgist I could see it taking decades of trial and error to successfully cast a block that would last more than a few minutes.

As I’m writing this I’m realizing that machining individual air cooled cylinders would be much easier, as well as having an external valve train and total loss oiling system."
The majority of people don't use or need cruise control
I... Huh. I love that flick but never thought of it as a driving movie. Makes sense though
"I think the CTR is both overhyped and underhyped... so properhyped?

On the one hand, it’s overhyped in that people will go on and on about how it’s the fastest hot hatch because of its speed around a track, yet the vast majority of buyers have never, and will never, take theirs on an actual track. I see more CTR’s slammed or on bags than I see actually racing.

On the other hand, it’s underhyped because people write it off for its looks and being FWD, despite it being an incredible performer with some of the best handling you can get in a car from the factory, drive wheels be damned."
"Ugh….how did you ever figure me out so quickly without ever meeting me?

"From what I’ve seen in terms of the average person’s speed discipline, they really ought to…."
Science of selling yourself short was surprisingly poppy
"The Civic sedans/coupes with the 1.5T are known to do 0-60 anywhere from 6.5 to 6.8. I’ve seen as fast as 6.5 in my hatchback, but usually right at 6.8. So a BRZ/86 is pretty equal once up to speed. The problem is the torque dip. The Civic made more torque and made it early in the rpms, exactly where the twins hit their torque dip. Anything less than a perfect launch is tough to recover from."
They were giving these out for like 6k below msrp. One of my friends bought a new autobahn GLI fully loaded for like 27.5k brand new.
"That's not really what OP asked. Those cars haven't been released yet for testers, so they don't fit the bill.

One example that's similar; the NSX had been in constant cancellation and development for years while the hype grew, but the car ended up disappointing fans for not being as fast as its contemporaries in 2016 and not being what fans wanted it to be (lightweight, 'affordable' supercar)."
"I remember dealers on the Cadillac forums tossing a hissy fit that the LT4 couldn’t be adapted to fit their existing manual transmission for the Gen3 CTS-V, while the Corvette Z-06 was rocking that same engine through a manual with a transaxle.  V fans who said they were going elsewhere were attacked for wanting a 640hp supercharged sport sedan with a manual.  Exiting owners were rebuked on the forums for saying that Cadillac just didn’t wanna offer a manual.  Imagine my surprise when GM announced the return of the manual in the CT5-V Blackwing.  Guess they found a way to make it work even on a low volume seller.

Edit:  fixed a typo on LSA vs LT4"
"The older one never did 6.2 sec just as much the auto never did 6.8 sec. Toyota has said that the auto is a full second quicker because it was never doing sub 7, it was closer to 7.5-7.7 secs.
So you can believe this will do 5.6 sec just by flooring it, I dont.
There’s a channel that got 6.45-6.88 sec with the manual and one with the right tires. You can question his driving skills but I doubt that a better driver will remove a full second.

"I agree they need to step up the performance stuff to be taken seriously but it's also the only reason I could even afford to get the kind of car that I wanted. I would have absolutely gone for a Type R, but the new markups are insane and the used prices were so high (pre-chip shortage) that it just didn't make any sense, a Type R just doesn't have over 10k of performance quality over a Veloster N, that prestige markup is why I couldn't afford it in the first place."

"That's...not what asymmetrical tires refers to...? 

It refers to the tread pattern having an ""inside"" and an ""outside"" which requires a certain sidewall to be facing outside.

"Yeh especially if its going to be the last big Caddy with a stick, If I did that I'd probably for the same reason want to option the CCB's as well but those things are just far to much money especially because I'm going to be a madman and get some winter tires for it, I don't want to damage the brakes.

"At $50k the Kia would be the top trim and the S4 would be the base trim, and the Kia has far more cargo room and a hatch. So on paper it makes plenty of sense to buy the Kia especially considering the Stinger often got sizable discounts.

Kia's mistake was listening to the enthusiasts and believing a practical hatchback with a decent mix of performance, features, and pricing will actually sell. I find enthusiasts would rather get more plate and brand coolness out of their purchases and regular customers who are willing to pay for practicality have moved onto SUVs."

Yea the cars themselves are nice etc. It's just always felt like whatever current gen Lexus models compare more accurately to the last year or even gen of competition.
"Yeah I ended up having to get mine replaced on my 17 EX-L. One day I tried to run my AC, and it just blew out hot air.

Apparently that part runs just north of $1k alone not factoring in labor, but all was replaced on Honda's dime due to the part being known to be defective.

I asked the service manager if the replacement part was redesigned so it wouldn't fail like the original one, but he didn't have a definitive answer for me. He did say that it was still covered for 10 years from date of purchase, so if it goes out again, hopefully it does it sometime before the remainder of the 10 years is up."

"I remember finding an older album of theirs (pre-""Wine"") on vinyl when I was in college and had an 80s radio show on campus radio.

"American dealerships really seem to ruin the experience. 

Here in Canada we have no markups and my experience buying my 21’ Veloster N 6MT was amazing: walk in, test drive, say I want one but in a different colour, wait for them to order one to be built in Korea, pay msrp, drive away"
"So its estimated that the standard battery pack is 115kw, and the average home in the US uses around 30k per day (like /u/beejers30 says, about 3 days). You could power a small camp for like a month with a full charge, and no/minimal driving.

I've already looked at hybrids/EVs for car camping and sleeping in with AC on, its very easily done with a Rav4 and Prius (iirc 5-10% battery drain overnight from running the AC while sleeping) from the videos I've seen. 

If lights are 500w (thats insane, enough to light a house) and you have a 2kw outdoor speaker system, that'll last about 46h, or roughly five 8h days of full blast music and lights. If you've used a portable battery before just compare the watt hours with the 115kw of the lightning"

"Yup, I've had an E34, E39, and an E90 and had none of this oversteer issues in panic situations. But none of those were as high-strung as an M4C would be setup.

Much like fighter aircraft are setup to be damn near unstable in static flight so they are more nimble, is the M4C setup to be 'on the edge' so a skilled driver can get around a course more quickly yet the average driver in a panic situation is now at more risk?"
"People who talk about the ""small cost to upgrade"" don't compare the same trims across the models.  A well equipped maverick is still dirt cheap compared to the ranger and the ranger is dirt cheap compared to the f150 when you're looking at vehicles with similar features."
"> did they really not know though? 

Of course they knew.  The difference compared to Tesla is that Ford would rather sell themselves short and act “humbly surprised”, than shoot for the moon and act like that was expected once they get there.

It makes for better optics."

"Your argument seems to be on the extremes, where as my OP was on the margin. In your world - you get a GTI because you care for performance, at the cost of reliability. If you don't care for performance - don't even worry about VWs altogether and get a Corolla. My argument is that there is probably a major group of people out there that want something that is better to drive than the Corolla and more practical than the Mazda 3. And the regular Golf just delivers that where there's no reason to pay the premium on the GTI."

The idea that people all need to have these behemoth sized vehicles really needs to go..."

"It’s easy to be shocked when you picture a band consisting of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, and those two outlive the guy who kept to himself, had a 56 year marriage, and by all accounts shirked the rock and roll lifestyle. Yeah, he was 80, but it still tends to be jarring when someone you grow up listening to and looking up to goes. It’s been almost 6 years and I still forget Lemmy passed, and that man lived a rough life. That generation of musicians has been a constant in many of our lives for decades, to see them go is never easy, no matter how expected it is."

The arena seated 15,000 I think and there wasn't even enough people to fill the floor seats (sad face). Anyway, I didn't go for Warrant. Type-O motherfucking slayed though. I still to this day don't know why they were even touring together."

"As far as the rev match, my car kind of does similar. I don't know the cutoff rpm or speed, but it definitely doesn't do it at all lower downm, sounds like honda's may just cut off at a higher rpm."
"Definitely seems to be rpm related as opposed to ground speed, and sure sounds like the transmission to me from what limited directionality I'm getting from a video on the internet, lol. But have them check your driveshaft first, it's easier and cheaper to check."
I hope they don't because then I might sell my Z06 to get a manual C8 Z06 and I don't want to sell my C7 Z06.

"China doesn’t have a single mass market car that is competitive outside of developing countries whose politicians receive Chinese bribes.

They are probably 30+ years behind on things like safety technology.

They seem to have futuristic EV auto technology because the government pressed it as a vanity project meant to impress the world, without actual fundamentals to back it up.

Their only hope to get a mass market car into a developed country is to partner heavily with another brand that has the technologies and engineering they need for things like safety, which will take massive investment at high risk, and China is already crazy laden with high risk debt."

"> GLI's always sell under MSRP anyways if you can be patient.

"> However, I also think the N brand misses the mark in terms of allure and prestige. There's just something about it that doesn't convince me it's a serious performance brand

I think you hit the nail on the head there. All the ""real"" performance brands aim to be the best in their segment, in competitive segments, and they're all-in committed to performance, for better (Porsche GT) or worse (M5). That's where the prestige comes from, even if the cars end up sacrificing too much for performance, they still get street cred for trying. 

The N brand never seems ready to commit, and seems to dodge obvious match ups against segment leaders. It also doesn't seem like they're trying to build ""the best"", they're still going for that ""90% of the performance for 80% of the price"" value performance package. There's little prestige to be earned from avoiding challenges and financial sensibility. People admire rockstars, the N brand is an accountant."

"""Latino"" is masculine when referring to something that's masculine, but it's also the grammatically correct default when a group of people or objects is of mixed gender. In some cases you'd even use phrasing that seems incorrect because of this principle. For example, if you refer to both of your parents, you say ""mis padres"" even though ""padre"" means father and there's no direct reference to your mother. 

Your little ""gotcha"" is like if someone said about English ""I like how you said plurals end with s then referred to a group of deer without an s. kinda proving yourself wrong there lmfao"""

"Call me crazy but I think once you get to the super high end engines, when we're talking 1000 horsepower, the car is just too fast for a manual. 

It becomes increasingly difficult to take even one hand hand off the wheel to shift with that much power if you're doing anything other than highway pulls.

It would be cool to have a Veyron\Chiron as a stick I guess, but the identity of the car is having this ultra- smooth dual clutch that makes that kind of power usable and accessible."
"Ordering cars isn't something that normal buyers do. If someone walks into a dealership with the intention of buying a new car, they don't want to leave empty handed and wait 10-12 weeks for a special order to be built and shipped to them. 

It made sense in the past for Hyundai not to have custom orders. They didn't have many different trims and options. My mom had a 2002 Elantra GLS. It was more or less the base trim for the USA. The only options were a sunroof, CD player, automatic transmission, and ABS. That was it. Of course most has automatics. Everything else was standard in the USA. The top level GT trim came standard with ABS and a CD player and fog lights. I don't think that you could even get fog lights on the GLS. You would just walk onto a lot, pick the color you wanted, and drive off with your new car. Custom orders didn't make sense back then.

But now that Hyundais have way more options and less standard features compared to their competitors, it make sense to introduce ordering."

The issue is the Genesis G70 isn't much more or the same with a far superior interior and is more competitive for the price.

"New Z is a different class. 170 more hp, not sure on the torque figures but would expect similar gap, $10k more base, larger, heavier, nicer, carbon fiber drive shaft shit and no back seats. The Z will more than likely be the better buy in terms of $/performance but again Z is closer to a GT car than to the low weight, low power sports car that is the GR86. I don’t think you can cross shop them since they target separate sectors of the market. 

If I can find a Z in the next 2 years for MSRP (assuming 2 years is enough for demand to fall enough for me not to get reamed by dealer surcharge), I’m strongly considering one to replace my Mustang. My brother has an FRS I’ve driven a ton and it’s really hard to go back to driving something low power and raw after being coddled by my Mustang lol."
"Not as interesting as some of the others, but I bought a 91 civic hatchback about 15 years back (still have the car today). In the glove box was the owners manual with random service receipt and the original bill of sale with the original owners info. I was able to pice together the history of the car with everything I found. It was purchased new in late 1990 in California, brought to Texas where it was then sold to owner #2, he took care of it until selling it to me. Turns out I'm the 3rd owner of a 30 year old car."
"I know a guy who has his 3rd C8 incoming, he keeps getting new ones, and just selling them a few months later and getting another one.

A few people have done this, its pretty ridiculous that if your on enough wait lists you could be getting a new C8 every 4-6 months and just sell them for 15-20k and have another show up to do it all over again.

I'd do it again and inquired to a few places but the lists are currently a year long so I didn't bother, if I could find one that would let me get another in the spring I'd probably do it and just trade in that C8 on the Blackwing a few months later."

"Why build an SUV? Well first off its honestly not much bigger than the Veloster, its not anywhere near an SUV. And again them building one CUV N that doesn't mean they're ""focusing on CUVs.""

"I wouldn't say they're niche.

They're very mainstream, and very easy to get into to be honest."
"Just because this is an apples to oranges comparison doesn't mean people won't make it. I cross shopped the Camaro, Giulia and Veloster when I was looking for my last car. They're all completely different cars with separate price tags, but they each had an aspect that appealed to me. I pretty frequently talk to people that cross shop vehicles that are nothing alike. Are the Kia and the Lexus in the same category at all? No, but the fact remains this guy had a choice between the two, and the Kia didn't impress enough to sway him."
"Not sure how much land you're talking, but I have 1/3 acre with approximately approximately 10,000sqft of grass. I usually weed whack/edge first around the driveway, house, flowerbeds, and 6 or so trees, then put the battery back on the charger while I mow, then blow the driveway/street when I'm finished mowing. Never had a battery issue in the summer.

I have had the battery start to die on me clearing light (\~1"" or less) snow in *very* cold (< -10) weather."

"I found [this demographics breakdown for new car buyers] (https://hedgescompany.com/blog/2019/01/new-car-buyer-demographics-2019/) Quite interesting:

> The average buyer of a new car, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) in 2015, earned about $80,000 per year.

So your estimate seems perfectly spot on. At 40%, that puts a new car purchase at 32k. 

What's even MORE interesting is that over 90% of buyers of new cars are home owners. Makes sense but that's a HUGE disparity"

"My dad bought an H2 hummer for $2k less than the H1 sitting right next to it. This was in the dying days of hummer and the dealer was desperately trying to get rid of everything they had and couldn’t.

Money shifting happens when accelerating. Downshifting from 3-2 at redline will overrev the engine and possibly destroy it.

"One lady who was a customer at my old shop bought a battered 99 (I think) Accord. Broke single mother, didn't really know anything about cars, and bought it from some sketchy lot. The trans was slipping when I pulled it in (it wasn't even the V6), the oil pan was heavily damaged, as was the front subframe, the tires were all bald and had at least 2 nails in them each, the rear brake lines were on their way out, it had a massive EVAP leak, and I believe it needed a timing belt. Thing was already battered cosmetically, it had been smoked in, and it had 220,000 miles or so, so there was 0 resale value. 

My friend/coworker and I both told her she'd be best off just replacing it since it would need at least $4000 worth of work to make it reliable, much less pass state inspection. We even offered to inspect any other car she was interested in free of charge, but we only ever saw her that one time. No idea what happened."

"I don’t care *at all* about a car’s prestige. I drive a Fusion Sport after all. What matters to me is if the vehicle meets *my* needs. In the case of the Veloster N, Kona N, and Elantra N, they meet an increasingly rare set of needs, especially in their price point: you can daily drive them and take them to the track on the weekends *in stock form*. Yes, [even the Kona N](https://youtu.be/U1uyGOb2Y5k). 

The last car I had that was capable of that kind of double duty was my Focus ST and that was only for autocross, not side-by-side circuit track racing. Now the Focus ST has left our shores and I can only think of 2-3 new vehicles under $35k that can be tracked in stock form, and the N models might very well be the most capable in that group. For that, I applaud Hyundai and their N division. 

Personally, I will happily buy a Kona N or Elantra N if they soften up the normal mode on their suspension to the point where I can daily drive the car with a baby in the back seat. I’d already own a Veloster N but I test drove one and it was much too stiff for Daddy duties, even in its softest setting. Fingers crossed that Hyundai adjusts the normal mode on the next two N models before they go on sale in America but I’m not holding my breath. NBD if they don’t, I’ll just continue test driving new cars until I find the one that sufficiently checks all of my boxes. 

And I certainly won’t hop on the internet and throw shade at the ones that aren’t a good fit for me 🙄"

We will shut up when we get manuals.
"To an enthusiast - absolutely. For your average driver... 

* a larger, more powerful engine - sure. But for pre-2018 (when the regular Golf had a 180hp 1.8T) that difference would be lost on your average driver in your typical road conditions. But it is a more noticeable gap for after the 1.4T switch, so I accept this premise. Flip side - the 1.4 gets better MPGs, which is a concern for Mr. Everydriver.

* a more tunable engine - and what % of econo-hatch drivers do this?  

* Brakes and Suspension - Subtle, and almost unnoticeable in normal road conditions, driving like a regular person. 

* Styling - Personal preference. The regular Golf in non-poverty trims looks nice (and is up with the Mazda 3 for the lookers in this bunch) already, especially on the Mk 7.5 refresh. GTI appearance package is a cherry on top, sure, but isn't THE reason to spend the $5k premium. 

* Heritage, aftermarket and community -- All enthusiast things than your average buyer does not concern themselves with.

* Resale - Not a thing if you drive it til the wheels fall of, but yes, it's a factor normal people look at when car shopping. But with that said, most of these folks will probably go with the Corolla just for this reason.

If anything - thank you for helping me expand on my angle. The extras you get for the GTI are easy to justify for an enthusiast, but your Joe Everydriver won't miss not having them in his regular Golf."
"I contend those albums would have been incredibly well received if they were by a new band NOT called Metallica.  King Nothing is fantastic, as is Bleeding Me.  It’s unfortunate Metallica got so much flack for doing what they wanted to do creatively."
This. Anything with 7k plus revs is at least kinda revvy. I think both the 1.6 and 1.8 had 7k plus redlines.
"This is 100% a 2nd commuter car (and all the compliance stuff others have mentioned). My office is filled to the brim with Gen 1 Leafs, and likely will be when we return. People commuting in cities/burbs with 20 mile or less commutes, a lot of parking garages at big companies near me have chargers too. These people all own an ICE as a 2nd vehicle so range anxiety is really a non-issue.

It'll be $27k with Fed incentives, and I don't know what California's extra incentives are but probably closer to $25k after those? That isn't crazy more expensive than a Bolt and I be the Mazda is a 100 times better places to sit during your commute.

Provided it holds than range when it is cold, and the batteries don't degrade, it will fill its role fine. I would at least test drive one if I do decide to get an EV commuter."

"Mark my words, the W222 will be remembered fondly in the future. One of the best looking gens in terms of both exterior and interior design (they blended both new school large touchscreens with old school leather and metal buttons so well). Also maybe it is because of the onslaught of high-tech cars from competitors like Tesla but when the W222 came out, I still remember how mind-blowing all of the tech like the dual screens, MAGIC body control, all the driver assistance systems etc. With this generation, other than the screen size they haven't made something that groundbreaking imo.

And it is disappointing because even Merc values the S Class as an icon, there is a reason why the S Class is still one generation ahead of the GLS when it comes to interior design despite SUVs being so hot.

Edit: Fuck, reading this comment makes me sound like an old man lol. Also, the W222 looked like a proper CEO/prime minister car. This large A class design would look out of place in front of an embassy or Ritz Carlton."
You either love it or hate it. I love that it looks so over the top.
I love this interview of [Charlie and Ron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1LspbZtwmM)

I'm in the same boat minus the headliner issue. The mileage number and added utility has me looking hard at these. Also the benefit of the higher ride is nice living in an area that is prone to flash floods.
Could be the same guy. There’s a surprising number of 918’s in the area. Hell I’m pretty sure there’s a second GT2 around here somewhere.
"I met a lot of people also don’t like crossovers that is probably why but it is too controversial, I agree. I guess because they are versatile and useful this will be a controversial opinion for a long time."

"I haven't looked into any actual stats, so this is me talking out of my ass, but my impression from various enthusiast boards and automotive media is that the Supra isn't selling well, so I think even if they originally planned for a manual, those plans are likely going to be scrapped."
"> They also perfected the design and proportions

Eh.... that's a very subjective opinion. I think the 993 was a very clear step down when compared to the 964 when it comes to aesthetics and design (though it's obviously faster and better performing)."
"I'm going to jump in here. I bought a 1995 Land Rover Defender 110 RHD imported from the UK for $43,000. Didn't get the car checked out by a mechanic or specialist either. Just wanted a Defender. Found a Defender. Bought a Defender. 

On the positive side, I love this thing and drive it every chance I get. My kids and friends love it too. It turns heads and gets a laugh out of car people and non car people alike. 

On the negative side, it has some rust. It was initially red, and was resprayed (poorly) a dark green. It leaks, makes noises, and needs new shocks. It's slow, loud, uncomfortable and rides like a pig. And I paid $43,000 which is crazy. I doubt I'll ever get my money back really and my bank account looks a lot lighter since I bought it. 

I do love that thing though."

"If she does go with a second generation Mini, try to get a 2011 or later as they made some engine quality improvements in the mid-cycle refresh. Still not a great choice if reliability is a concern though. Personally I think the 2015+ Clubman is better looking than its predecessor and it's from the higher reliability, current generation of Minis - but finding one under $15k is probably tough."

"""I Envy Your Apathy"" is definitely an odd one. Pat's vocals are a huge change, and the whole thing sounds more like a Hot Water Music song than Tigers Jaw."
cant fault you for practicality.  the reality of something like a C8 is it is probably a really fun car to own for a short while.  you don't have to keep a car you love forever.  it needs to fit your life as a useful tool.
"I don't agree that its just a young people thing. I think it is a sound/tech evolution thing. 

It seems that older enthusiasts think its more important for a muscle car to be loud. I, and others, think it's more important for a muscle car to be the fastest thing in a straight line, and now there is a better option for that than a big v8. Experience vs. performance. And that's not a new opinion, either, see: the Buick Grand National.

And yes, I have idolized Muscle cars since I was a kid, and I've even owned one. I'm not just some geek Tesla fanboi... In fact, I don't like any currently available non-supercar EVs."
"Hey Sam, thanks for doing this! Congrats on the new EP. Have you learnt anything from the past 18 months during the pandemic, and do you think this will change the way musicians work going forward?"
Definitely get the AC checked out. The 10th gen civics have awful ACs. I had mine replace before I even hit 1000 miles. I suspect the auto rev match feature doesnt always match is to save gas. In +R mode it will rev match regardless of the rpm

"Because then you’re buying a Fiat or Chevy.

RAV4 is probably a better bet fit people who care about a brand’s reputation for reliability, but I can also tell you a Mazda is a much nicer car to sit in than a Toyota."
"As an old-gen STI owner and fanboy that tried the new gen STI and a Type R, the Type R is just a better car UNLESS you need AWD. More practical, better interior, more fun to drive. 

Not worth a 10k markup but MSRP to MSRP, definitely a better car."

"EVs can be exactly the same looking as a muscle car... Minus the sound. 

Now, that's not the most efficient way to make an EV, sure, but ""they cannot replicate"" is absolutely not true.

Whether the Dodge EV muscle car sells, should be very interesting to observe. That's a different question, my guess is, yes if it's a decent product, irrespective of what the hardcore muscle dudes think."
"Wasn't there a dude in China who made a replica Lamborghini, but it turns out it wasn't a replica but rather he bought all the parts of a Lambo and put it together"
"I agree completely. I just remember all of the hype when the A90 was first rumored, first spied, first announced... before all the details regarding the BMW collaboration were known (in the beginning it wasn't clear it would be 95% BMW). 

It wasn't just the Supra name though. It was the fact that Toyota was finally returning to the sports car business after nearly 2 decades without an entry. I can understand why people were upset to learn they'd just farmed it out to BMW, even if the result is a great car."
I mean…
"They’re not the ideal for me, but I think they have either tapped into, or created, the concept that tech and aesthetics are their own form of luxury when it comes to interiors. They know many would rather pay a 1000 bucks for a larger infotainment than 1000 bucks for extended leather on the dash or door panels. What’s annoying is that everybody else is trying to get a piece of that pie now, but it’s tough to make everybody happy. As a result you walk into an audi or Mercedes dealership and at the entry level we often see that they aren’t even bothering to offer classic luxury options any longer. When size is a deciding factor in a vehicle you’re effectively SOL if you want a luxury sedan or coupe smaller than an Audi A6 or A8. It’s really like, get an A3 with some oddly nice/sturdy plastic surfaces, or you have to spend 2-3x the price for “sport luxury” like a 911 or something.

Mercedes did it in an interesting way by keeping some of the heritage of the C class still being luxurious, but it’s kind of a bait and switch. C classes are now like $55k and they have shifted the entry level by creating the A class: a really cool looking iPhone on wheels, also equipped with synthetic materials wherever a touch screen is absent."

Songs like Gigantic and Gouge Away are some examples. Josephine Wiggs fills a similar role in the Breeders, with Kim on guitar. Both are amazing players but you'll probably never see them on lists of greatest bassists.

I'm not sure if you could call him a bassist in the traditional sense, but Mark Sandman of Morphine was incredible also, he played 2-string slide bass and had a really unique sound."

"I'm really curious to see what my experience is like when the Elantra N starts showing up in dealerships.  I haven't heard the best things about Hyundai dealers and especially with them treating the Veloster N the way they did, like you said.  If the local dealers won't/can't get in a Elantra N 6 speed and then try to sell for above MSRP or otherwise just act like it's some unicorn, I'll likely go for the CTR instead."
"Doug, if you read this, why didn't you mention and show pictures of the ""executive first class"" package for the rear? you made it seem like there are no rear features at all for an S Class, that car didn't even have rear climate controls, jeez."
"This is an interesting take. I agree that for most uses the regular Golf is totally sufficient, but the GTI is what, 5k more base, and for that you get: a larger, more powerful, more tuneable engine. Better brakes, suspension, styling, differential. More heritage, far more aftermarket support, resale value, bigger community. I think it becomes worth it pretty quick, even if those features won’t be exploited to their full potential."

"Nah. A money shift might be (for example) a 5 to 2 when you meant to go 5 to 4 (or even worse, a 4 to 1 when trying to go 4 to 3).

You can avoid money shifts if you only depress the clutch enough to shift to your intended gear, but a lot of aggressive drivers (like those who grew up watching Fast and Furious and assuming that's how it's meant to be done) will just mash the clutch all the way down, making the money shift easier, and then release the clutch with the same aggression, giving them no time to correct when the engine starts overrevving.

And then, *then* is when things get expensive. For BMW's, a lot of the cars are going to immediately float (and bend) valves. This will require replacing potentially all the valves, and depending on the platform, may require replacing other bits between the camshafts and the valves. It essentially requires an entire top-end rebuild. But you don't have to do it for very long (one or two seconds is enough), because the damage isn't a product of overrevving, it's a product of the engine (acting as a brake) not able to keep up with the load (the mass of the car, effectively) being applied so quickly."

"It probably won't happen, but what I want for a third generation EV NSX is for it to cost 70-120k. 

I don't want Acura to try to make it compete with Tesla or hyper EVs. I don't think they'll be successful because they don't have the engineering ability like Tesla does and they don't have the brand to command such high prices either.

Instead what they should focus on is making a ""basic"" EV sports car since no one has really done that since the original Tesla Roadster. It doesn't need to do 0-60 in under 2 seconds, and trying to make it do so would be a losing battle. Instead make a good-looking, amazing-handling EV sports car and make it affordable. Electric motors are so zippy that 400HP in one already feels fast. A Model 3 Standard honestly feels faster than my car in most situations. There are a lot of people that want something like that, and it would draw a lot of attention to Acura as a brand when you see them on the road."

He just scooped them out and tossed them into the woods next to the driveway and vacuumed the rest out.

Type of vehicle: open to sedan/hatchback/SUV/crossover

Must haves: A nice sound system would be great (bluetooth capability). Infotainment that doesn't suck. Reliable / not terribly expensive to maintain. At least somewhat fun to drive. Non-basic trim level would be great. Leather interior would be a nice bonus. 7 Litres/100km = 40 MPG or around that.

Desired transmission (auto/manual, etc): either

Intended use: Daily Driver

Vehicles you've already considered: Mostly Mazdas (CX-5 / 3) but glanced at Škodas (Fabia, Superb), VW (Golf/Polo), Toyotas (RAV4, Corolla). Mazda seems the most attractive so far. 

Is this your 1st vehicle: Yes.

Do you need a Warranty: Not expecting it.

Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Not really.

Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: no

Additional Notes: Basically I'm looking for semi-nice wheels mostly for going from A to B. I'm not necessarily a ""car guy"", but appreciate nice features and at least a bit of sex appeal. I've driven the rents' 2008 Volvo s40 for years and have enjoyed it.​The budget range I've set is quite large I guess. A cheaper, reliable car would be better, but possibly willing to go up to ~15k for sexier options. I suppose a lot of the stuff I've mentioned is subjective.

Are you sure they’re *second* commuter cars? All the Model 3 owners I know have them as their only cars, or at best their SOs have a non-EV but it’s still not “their” car. Meanwhile, a 100-mile EV, you do pretty much require a second car."
"How about comparing to actual rwd sort cars in the price segment lol. Mx5?

It’s like saying a Tesla is slow compared to a fa18 hornet.

"> Or is it just easier to justify R&D costs on a halo car, even if the car itself won't make money?

I mean, on some level, there's probably a thought amongst management that the prestige brought to the brand diffuses far enough into the pedestrian side of things that the expense can be justified. If you spend all that money on R&D for a ""normal"" vehicle, you're betting on massive sales of a normal car to normal people to make back the money straight up. With a halo car, you're probably targeting a smaller audience - but one that you know likes to buy this stuff even if the value equation is all over the place. Plus you're hoping that your image gets boosted enough elsewhere that it doesn't matter that it's not making back money in the most direct sense.

Of course, it still has to be a *good* car, which is probably half the battle."

"$15k will basically get you nothing even before the pandemic, even in terms of used cars. That’s like base Kia Soul money when I was shopping. So long as Mazda is aiming this closer to the C class than a base vehicle, then there’s some decent value proposition. Also didn’t mention the Federal tax credits. It’ll be competitive around the $25k mark which is where I hope it’ll be when all is said and done."

From what I can tell from a quick research, the GS350 is 41% more expensive (52.4k vs 37.1k) at starting gt-line trims, and a second slower on 0-60 (5.7 vs 4.7). I can understand having a more luxurious, higher quality car and not caring about dumb street light races, but you're comparing apples to oranges. Aren't both models dead anyways in the short term?"

"Yes and no, I don’t think any kids are begging their parents to get them one. However they are reasonably inexpensive for a young persons without a ton of money. Plus they can be made relatively quick for less than $1k. I was a fresh college graduate and picked mine over the “faster” Focus ST just because of the modification potential. Granted it’s also a nice place to be for a long amount of time, and also flies under the radar. It also cruises at higher than interstate speeds confidently."

Same with Kevin Spacey - I just love him as an actor. A beautiful mind is one of the best movies in my opinion but Kevin Spacey as a person is maybe a sexist offender and predators which is a huge nono for me ('maybe' because I have no idea what the current status of this is and I haven't followed up on this).

It's definitely important to seperate the art from the persona making the art because art is subjective and means something different for anybody. At the same time you shouldn't  support an artist who is just a huge racist/Homophobe/whatever.
It's probably a case-by-case decision and hugely subjective. Would I go to an Eric Clapton concert? Most likely. Would I go to a Ted Nugget concert? Hell no.
So you could say that I'm a hypocrite and maybe that is true but I think that there is no clear answer to this."

"Mark I have to 100% agree with you. For me it’s a bit sad, I feel like the brand had a ton of potential. The Veloster N was great, but dealers acted like it was a Ferrari at first. Then they release the Kona N. It’s an SUV that has no extra practicality over the Veloster and no AWD. The car enthusiasts have no reason to buy it over the Veloster and the average person couldn’t care about a stiffer, less comfortable, more expensive Kona. Then they release the Elantra N. No price yet, but the front is terrible. Hyundai from the beginning should have just released the i30N. Have something that’s not weird like the Veloster that will pull a lot of customers from the GTI/Type R, and let that build the brand. If you’re building a brand, pick models that appeal to a large amount of people, not a performance Hyundai suv. Build your reputation so that everyone knows the brand before building dumb stuff."

"I changed the all the common gaskets myself on that car at 190k, except for the oil pan since I didn’t have the space to drop the subframe. Didn’t stop the transfer case from killing itself at 202k after I had just changed the fluid with a kit from FCP euro, the washer fluid pump from dying 5 separate times, a relay (probably fuel pump but never did figure this one out) from melting 4 separate times, the purge valve taking a shit, the indirect TPMS having errors, the blower motor recall, the pcv heater recall, then finally at 220k it was right back to leaking oil from the filter housing again. I decided enough was enough and traded it in on a Honda. I will admit it was a fun car right up til the very end, and despite smelling like a crayola orgy inside on hot summer days it was always happy to sit and cruise at 80mph on the highway. I will miss that car because it got me through a rough time in my life, but I’m happy to see it go at the same time."

The early Lightning Lap times were literally just a press car and a journalist lapping the track as fast as they felt comfortable. Now it's like companies trying to set Nurburgring lap times.

"wrong.  you automatically assume she’s a disney teen pop spin.  she’s not.  she signed with a record label outside of disney.  she wrote all her own songs on the debut album.  go check the writing credit on genius.  the entire album only written and produced by Olivia and Dan. no team of producers or 40 year olds writing teen lyrics.

she even owns her own master recordings like Taylor:

"> The vast majority of high HP FWD cars, for example, are doing 6-6.5 secs in the real world.

You're being too kind, the 15 year old MS3 and Cobalt SS do 5.4-5.5 seconds. Current cars like the GTI, CTR, and Veloster N PP do it in 4.8-5.1 seconds. 6-6.5 seconds is what you expect out of a 15 year old fwd Civic Si with no torque or turbo."

The combination of the shitty clutch/shifter feel and rev hang just killed it, taking off and shifting smoothly felt more like guesswork than something satisfying and mechanical. I think I'd rather have the auto to be honest, at least then you can just mash the pedal and go (slowly).

I mean I like the manual in my shitty Hyundai work van, I don't think my standards are very high at all, but now I get what people are talking about when they mention truly ""bad"" manuals."
"do you think some of those options were cut because of supply chain issues so they didn't have a 'loaded' model to let you showcase?

"seems to me the car just isn’t a fit for you. i’ve heard great things about it, and supply issues are mostly due to a ton of orders and the raw material shortages everyone is still experiencing."
"Where I'm at, it's the M sport models. Every morning on my to work is this black M240I going 25 over the speed limit and weaving in and out of traffic."
Why the eff would Hyundai make a McLaren rival?
"A 3-2 can easily be a money shift if you're at an rpm in 3rd that causes an overrev in 2nd. Any downshift can be a money shift if you perform it at an improper rpm.

A 4-2 can be a money shift too; it also can be intentional and perfectly appropriate if you rev match properly. A 4-2 money shift is pretty unlikely though, because it's pretty hard to accidentally shift from 4th to 2nd... where else would you be intending to go with that shift?"

My only point really is there is a notable portion of orders that are not ""reservations without a deposit"" and that there are a lot of people vested in this perorder, so the number of preorders isn't as insubstantial as OP implies."

"Am I missing something or haven't this car been out since 2020??? Is there something special about this 2022 version? From what i can see it looks identical to the one we had out on the roads in Europe for over a year now already. Very confused, is this just the announcement that it's coming to the US?

Also i'm not sure why people are trashing the range. Like yeah, it's low, it's a city car. It is priced competitively compared to similar EV Crossovers. For example in Denmark the MX30 with a 35kwh battery is $37,000 while a Peugeot 2008-E with 50kwh and the same amount of horsepower is $43,000. Same thing for a Kia Niro, 40kwh battery, 136HP, $43,000. This Mazda is the cheapest EV crossover on the market i think.


This is a perfectly viable real world competitive European city car. Yes, it probably doesn't make sense outside of big cities in the US."

I could see it being a cool little highway cruiser, with how low and reclined you sit in it compared to other sedans. Being able to drop right into 3rd or 4th for a little pull on the highway, or blowing through 2nd into 3rd on an onramp, then comfortably and quietly cruising for a few hours and getting good gas mileage. 

I had an '05 Accord with a stick, and while it wasn't anything like a sports car, it was nice to be able to row through the gears in a car that is obviously built for commuting. I think the V6 Camry adding a stick would actually be able to appeal to an older generation that may reminisce about driving standard, but doesn't want to buy a sports/sporty car."

"I'm all for cars with some personality and that can just make you smile when you drive them.  I love my Si but I wouldn't say it has a whole lot of personality.  Depending on price, I'm definitely considering the Elantra N when it comes out.  Really looking forward to some reviewers getting their hands on them in the near future.  Seems like they are actually trying to build a car that can be driven on the track for a bit w/o issues by addressing things like cooling.  And by using parts like the integrated drive axle (still trying to figure out how it differs) it shows they aren't just paying lip service to performance.

If the Kona N were available w/ the 6 speed, I might consider that instead as I'm a sucker for a hot hatch.

edit: also, as an IMSA fan, it's always interesting to see which manufacturers show up to race weekend w/ a booth full of vehicles.  Ever since Hyundai got into IMSA, they've been showing up to Watkins Glen w/ a booth full of cars.  Ford no longer has a booth and I've never seen Honda have one there (although Acura does).  For a series that really encourages fan engagement it is pretty cool to be able to go to a manufacturers booth (where they typically have one of their racecars on display) and check out some of their cars, especially when they have some performance oriented vehicles."

"This is where I was at, and the dealers put a very bad taste in my mouth. Same with you, I wasn't even able to get into one. I had a hard time even trying to test drive an Elantra N-line. The whole experience really put me off the brand as a whole. I'd love to try out the Elantra N when it comes out, but if the dealers behave the same way with it (and I doubt they're going to change) combined with the fact that the 30k-50k market for a fun car seems to be getting a shot in the arm over the next year or two, I doubt I'll end up in one even if it turns out to be an amazing car."

Ya. It’s actually faster then any 5.7 Chrysler even the new rt 5.7. But aside from that it’s just fast ina straight line. You can drift in it. But the suspension is too jerky and soft for it.

Hold on, isn't this actually a good number of changes? The drivetrain for the Plaid is undoubtedly solid, but my understanding of track times tells me that changing suspension, brakes, and weight are cumulatively worth a lot of time. Granted you *are* comparing it to a *Senna*, but I feel like using ""nothing but"" downplays what the changes are, lol"

Enthusiasts like you and me would probably fork up the extra money such an engine would costs, but Joe Average wouldn't. It's important to remember this started as a Scion project and was meant to get young buyers into a sports car they could afford. It was largely successful as the average age of the buyers was very young. Pricing them out of an 86/BRZ would have cratered already low sales."

Lol seriously. This is a full second slower 0-60 than a Mustang GT from almost 2 decades ago and is roughly on par with a run-of-the-mill F150 these days.

"Serious reply to balance out the snark.

Firstly, your comparison is disingenuous.  Production capacity of a single vehicle versus two distinct models is always going to be lower.  If you’re okay with counting the 3 and Y together, then count ICE F-150 production, or at least the hybrid’s, as part of the Lightning’s total.

If you want to talk total EV production, the Lightning is just 1 of 5 EVs that Ford will have in production by 2024: the others being the Mach E, E-Transit, and the CX-7XX pair.  Technically, Oshkosh’s NGDV for the USPS should count too, as Ford is supplying the powertrains.  Now, **Tesla’s global production will almost certainly still exceed Ford’s total in 2024, but then why do you feel the need to make bad faith arguments when sticking to the facts would prove you right anyways?**

Tesla has figured out how to push past the battery bottleneck, and executed that plan very successfully.  Ford is still in the early execution stages of ramping up battery supply, and they have yet to take the critical step of moving things in-house.  Until then, the Lightning’s production runs are constrained by how many cells SK is willing to fork over.  The same will be true of every Ford EV prior to CX-7XX."

"> In a true 4x4 engage 4lo put it in first gear and engage your center locker

Center lock is only for trucks with AWD. Traditional 4WD doesn't need one. I don't think anybody would say that a Wrangler isn't a ""true 4x4"" and they don't have center locks.

>A manual 4x4 truly sucks in comparison to an automatic 

I see this sentiment a lot here and it's simply not true in my experience. Using a manual offroad is exactly the same as using a manual on a track: it's a preference thing. Modern autos are better than manuals in performance no matter what you're doing, but some people just think it's more fun to have a direct connection to your engine. I go offroad a lot here in Colorado and I see old manual jeeps and FJs and Tacomas doing all kinds of crazy shit."

"I worked at one of the 2 Ford F150 plants for the first few years out of college as a Plant Vehicle Team engineer (basically a product engineer.) I was hired thru a ""head hunting"" or contractor company instead of being a direct salaried Ford employee though. I was at the plant everyday for 9 to 10 hours a day with paid OT since I was a contractor. This literally the only ""benefit"" of that job.

Every day would start the same. Log in, make sure nothing is on fire on the production line with your parts, review the day prior's quality metrics and prepare to answer to any outstanding quality issues that may come up in the daily quality meeting. My day to day consisted of testing and trialing out new iterations of designs of parts that Product Development had come up with that were either better, addressed some quality or customer satisfaction issue, or were a cost save to the company. My job was to make sure these new revisions would not negatively impact production and to coordinate and handle making the changes. There would be late night calls from the production teams when things would go awry and they'd need help but those were usually due to the wrong test parts being sent to them or operators missing key steps in their instruction sheet we had outlined to prevent issues. 

We also handled warranty claims from customers and dealers, called them for further details and to request the ""defective"" parts and then figure out ways to either change our manufacturing process or part design to fix these issues. If there were enough issues or no containment on a problem we'd have to have a ""stop ship"" and at that point it's all hands on deck for you to contain the problem, find a solution, and implement it as quickly as possible. Sometimes this was as easy as adding a piece of tape or butyl rubber. Other times you'd be filling up the entire yard with trucks while diagnosing and getting a fix in. 

It was a real good job out of college. I learned a lot and can see now that I'm at a new company (since Ford baulked a couple times at hiring me directly) that it gave me a real sense of urgency and correcting/preventing issues that I don't tend to see in some of my new coworkers.

Ive rambled some but if you have questions I'd be happy to answer. Best of luck on the job hunt!"
"Oh yeah no doubt it's a fantastic engine for squeezing power out of reliably, however it's not exactly an awe-inspiring engine that revs high or has much character.

">The first gen wasn't price competitive and Honda did what they wanted instead and sold terrible numbers.

Ehh that's not entirely accurate.  When the first gen NSX came out it was faster than the comparable Ferrari (the 348) while costing less and being a lot more usable and reliable.  They sold several thousand NSX's each of the first 3 or 4 years.  It was only after Honda let the NSX languish without updates that the sales slowed down to a trickle.

To put it in perspective, the original NSX sold almost as many units in one year as the 2nd gen sold in 5.  


>The 2nd gen wasn't price competitive because of tech Honda wanted to use rather than what was practical.

The price wasn't necessarily bad, but the technical approach made the car pretty heavy, which compromised performance.  Ultimately Honda's core mistake is that they set the performance targets for the NSX to where the last generation of the competition was, not to where it would be.  The first gen NSX punched well above its weight  at launch, the 2nd gen was middle of the pack or worse when it debuted.

Maybe giving the 2nd gen NSX 650 hp or whatever it would've taken to lead in its class would have been cost prohibitive, we'll never know."

"Type-R transmission is notoriously finicky. 1-2 is usually notchy and it’s easy to “out shift” the transmission where you shift too fast. The transmission usually works better when fully warmed. Changing fluid can help the shifts.

"While what you’re saying is probably right, I don’t honestly think it works like that in reality. All of the “performance“ monikers of the German makes are rooted in motorsports or have a well storied pedigree. Nobody (necessarily) minds that the AMG and M CUVs exist because the brands were established with performance sedans and coupe - the authenticity of the origins lend weight to the now broader use of the label.

The same thing doesn’t really work for Hyundai’s N lineup. Sure they compete in WRC... but that’s both a fairly (in the grand scheme of things) recent move and it’s only one of many other outlets they could be pursuing to get people to take them seriously. You see a brand like Hyundai slap the N badge on a Kona and you ask why they couldn’t have just called it a “Sport” trim and leave it there. Not to mention that when you get to an AMG or M or GT car you’re looking at *serious* changes to the base vehicle. For Hyundai, not so much."

They're a young company still trying to find their footing, so I'll give them a pass on visuals — the general configuration so far seems promising. It's nothing you can't fix with a design refresh.

The Zeekr 001 actually **WAS** a L&C model. Originally it was called the Lynk Zero. Late in the game, Geely decided to split it off into an entire sub-brand. My understanding is that Lynk will remain HEVs and PHEVs while Zeekr will be an all-electric brand and a direct Tesla competitor.

>MG has been advertising their low-cost race models in the UK for a while now. Now might be a ripe opportunity to test the waters in outside markets (like Australia) with the 6 X-Power.

I'm very certain they'll be doing this. Hasn't been announced yet, but it seems like such a no-brainer move.

>Very interesting overall. I'd probably still stick with Japanese or even SK brands for a variety of reasons, but Chinese cars have come a long way. I'd go for something Geely/Volvo-based if I had to get a Chinese car.

There's still quite a bit of progress to be made. But I think we're at the point where Geely, BYD, NIO, Li, and SAIC are making cars arguably as good as the Americans, Koreans, Germans, and Japanese in each of their weakest aspects — and *indisputably* better than the French and Italians (Bugatti, Ferrari, and Lamborghini excluded). That's significant — they are demonstrably ready for the world stage."

"It's funny because that's the exact same conclusion on this end as well. The outside of the cx5 looked sharp and the driving was nice, but they don't give a damn about how it drives, in the end the interior simply wasn't matching the price point. It also didn't help the sales person was clueless and didn't want to actually sell a car I think. But without that test drive they never would have known the interior and layout was terrible to them. They didn't even read reviews, just loved Mazda a whole lot lol."

The papers weren’t there, but I did find a strange Manila envelope back there. Opened it up and there were 20 or more gold rings, all with diamonds, and also some loose diamonds. Mom was looking through them and told me one was a mother’s ring (with gemstones of her children). There were some BIG diamonds. 

After about a week of trying to find the guy that owned it before me I finally found an email. Sent him a message asking if he’d lost anything and got an immediate response that he’d lost an envelope full of his mother’s jewelry. 

He drove 3 hours to come and get them and was so very grateful to have them back."

"Once they started doing that in the '80s with extended cab/6' models, it was only a matter of time until full crew cabs took over.

If Chevy had actually made enough of them that they could sell at MSRP it would go a long ways to doing what they set out to.

The thing is that the dealerships also allow this and encourage it.  I've only ever seen one dealership deny somebody because of it and I gotta say I respected them for it. They had the manager come out and talk to the guy and ask why he was trading in etc etc and said they couldn't do it because it simply was a bad decision and wanted him to think on it. I know it goes against business but it was wild seeing them actually be like we're both adults and please rethink this decision.

"Out of curiosity (I'm really curious, not just stirring the pot), is this really a big deal?  Maybe Nissan does things differently than other brands.

Second part:  I thought the 370 chassis was a good setup.  I know it's old, but what is expected to be improved upon/changed since the 370 development?  Is it possible they've made incremental improvements that don't warrant a part number roll?

Besides making Nissan look cheap, can it also be a good thing (saving costs, using strengths)?"

Remember when Infiniti tried to do an in house performance brand called ""IPL"" (Infiniti Performance Line) on the G37 a few years ago? 

Yeah, it could end up a lot worse.

That said Hyundai seems to be slow at grasping at how to market performance vehicles. The gap between N-line and N is not as well defined by Hyundai dealers, unlike Audi and their S-line, S and RS model range.

I love the fact Hyundai is still trying to cater to the enthusiast crowd here with affordable models, but I still feel they lack a halo/aspirational model at the top to build the brand, even if that car would never make a profit for Hyundai at this time (think Lexus LFA)"

">There was nothing really wrong with the chassis, and it's still extremely potent.

This is debatable. Fundamentally, the FM platform is sound but the 370Z Nismo wasn't competitive at its price point. Without properly tuned adaptive dampers or at the very least, a manually adjustable suspension, this car is going to have trouble keeping up with Supra, Mustang, Camaro, and even the Civic Type R on track. 

It isn't a great practice to compare lap times from different days with different drivers, but C&D's lightning lap times are probably the best we can use. AS 2009 370Z Nismo ran a 3:12 around VIR while a 2018 Civic Type R ran a 3:03.9. Considering the majority of the new Z is a carryover, I'm not sure the turbo 6 will be enough to close that gap. Its worth noting Nissan didn't make any significant changes between the 2009 Nismo and the last model year Nismo. Objective performance testing across multiple publications shows virtually the same results.

All that said, I don't think it matters. This car is still going to be quicker than almost everything on the road. I personally think the styling is great and the interior is vastly improved. If I was in the market, I'd get this over the competition, numbers be damned."

"I recall something about certain companies that made resistors. They made 2 sizes, large and small (relatively). The large ones could be use in processes such as automotive because there wasn't always a need for things to be as small as say the resistors in your phone.

Because they made 2 sizes they had to keep up 2 types of machinery making relatively the same end product. They decided to get rid of the larger sized resistors because it would save money and anything needing them would have to move to the smaller resistors. What they didn't do was increase the manufacturing of these smaller resistors in such a way that would make up for the demand and such affect the supply chains all over.

Kinda vague but I really don't recall which mfg or anything like that, just that this example was happening and a trend of what's to come."

"There are accurately a handfull of cars that fit that image. The GTI is one, the Infinity's are another, WRXs, the e90-92 BMW 3 series, the mustang of all years. 

The thing about the GTI is you can nearly double the horsepower with a tune and more than double it if you are willing to upgrade the clutch and go catless before you tune. The potential for speed is certainly there, it's fairly reliable, affordable, and good looking.

"> As you stated the CTR is both more practical and a better car than the Veloster, why would I choose the Veloster?
> 
> Same for the Elantra N, why would I choose that over the CTR?

Right, I get that. But to me, logical reasoning is differentiated from ""excitement"". As an example, the ND RF truly excites me, but logically, a new GR86/BRZ would be an objectively better buy in nearly every metric (speed, limit handling, interior space, etc). This shouldn't mean that the Miata fails to excite me, but rather a different exciting option within the segment simply makes more sense. 

As has been universally established, the CTR is an objectively better car, but it's also at a higher price to boot (without factoring in ADM). And virtually everyone who's driven both has great to things to say about each, often while eschewing the CTR in favor of the Veloster N due to the value proposition (and sound, which personally is a huge deal to me that the aftermarket hasn't addressed on the CTR).

Perhaps I'm just being too pedantic, but while I understand how the N lineup might not persuade you to switch over, this shouldn't be equated to excitement. Say if Honda hadn't to produce a CTR at all and the Civic lineup was capped at the Si, would the Veloster N then be of interest? 

I won't factor the ITR in here as it's purely a nostalgic machine, so any comparison would be unfair. That being said, I'm also quite interested in the new Integra and I'll be watching that very closely. Thus far, the new Z and GR86 haven't disappointed, so let's shoot for the threefer!"

"Going down by one gear is almost certainly safe unless you're already near redline before the downshift. Moneyshifts tend to happen either when skipping gears (intentionally, but by too much) or when the driver accidentally chooses the wrong gear.

Moneyshifts can happen on an upshift, too, or at least when the driver meant to upshift. Driver is accelerating hard, in 3rd gear. Reaches the top of 3rd, but they're also in a right-hand sweeper. They try to shift 3 -> 4, but the cornering loads mean everything doesn't line up right. They end up shifting 3 -> 2. If this was done at redline it'll cause a pretty significant overrev, almost certainly enough to damage parts (so a moneyshift). 

An example: If you are in 3rd gear at redline in my Miata, and you accidentally get 2nd instead of 4th, if you're unlucky you'll spin the motor to nearly 9400 rpm. At that rpm, the valves will ""float"" (not close when they should), and the valves and pistons will bang into each other. You'll need the top end of the motor rebuilt at least, and you'll probably have to replace the pistons as well. 

If you were lucky, the back tires will lose grip instead and you'll spin the car. Hopefully you're doing this at a track with runoff room, so you just get dirty. Avoid this by not shifting in turns.

Another way to moneyshift is to skip too many gears when downshifting. You may have to skip a lot of gears, though. If I'm cruising along at 55 mph in 6th gear, and I downshift to 2nd, I won't have moneyshifted. That is an overrev in my Miata (at 55 mph it'll be a hair over 7,000 rpm, and redline is 6800 rpm), but 7,000 rpm does not damage anything on this motor. The rev-limiter is actually at 7,200 rpm and damage doesn't actually start until over 8,000 rpm. So that's just an overrev, not a moneyshift. 

That's a lot of different terms, practices, and behaviors to soak in. The short version is: Be careful when shifting near redline, and don't skip a bunch of gears. Do those two things and you'll almost certainly be fine."
"But the Stinger isn't intended to sell well. I mean yes, obviously Kia was hoping for that, but the main purpose of the Stinger was to act as a HALO car that creates interest in the Kia brand.

I can accept EVs for what they are. You need a hell of a lot more than torque and low center of gravity (which is laughable considering it makes almost no difference in reality) to make a good enthusiast car. They're not engaging. They are appliances. Great daily drivers, terrible fun cars. Individual benefits are meaningless if they dont add up to a good package."
"There are updates to the chassis I'm sure, and platform sharing is nothing new.

My biggest gripe is that it's pretty heavy for a small car. It weighs as much as a Mustang Ecoboost HP but is significantly smaller. 

New platforms means new materials and updated design. New materials tend to be lighter as do new designs. The Toyobaru twins are about the same size and 400lbs lighter, and still manage to squeeze two back seats.

Same goes for the engine. They're older designs which means changes, while good, are incremental at best.

A good example would be when the Mustang went from the 4.6L V8 to the 5.0. it was a huge leap forward in engine development. Then going from a live rear axle to IRS of the S550. These are big jumps in performance, refinement, handling, etc...

The Camaro saw a similar jump when moving to the Alpha platform it shares with Cadillac.

The ND Miata also experienced this when moving on from the NC.

Meanwhile the Challenger and Charger, while selling well, aren't really making any waves beyond adding bigger and more powerful engines. Not many people buy them because of handling. They sell well more for cost and looks than actually being better than the Mustang or Camaro."

But look at Colorado vs Silverado or Tacoma vs Tundra. There's a pretty sizeable and persistent price difference. Midsize *is* cheaper than full size.

"> The metal community on the whole figured they were ""goth chick shit""

I disagree with this statement, as someone who was at uni in the early to mid-90s and in the indie, grunge and metal ""community"".

All the metalheads I hung out with got Type O totally. They had a real humour about them, hilarious sometimes actually, and were taking the piss even out of themselves and their fans and the goth metal scene.

Just look at the tracks man. Creepy Green Light for example, lol. And of course Black No 1 is really obvious.

They do have some great stuff though sadly some of it is a bit overlong. Wolf Moon and Love You to Death era was a bit more serious and Everyone I Love is Dead/ Everything Dies got super dark but very cathartic. 

Sad he died so young. Those tracks got me through a lot.

Sport mode does NOT rev match under 2k RPM that's incorrect.
I think it makes the most sense for Hyundai to start with smaller cars like they have done with the Veloster/Elantra/i30. Not sure the Kona is really obscure? They likely are doing multiple smaller cars as they can share development a lot more than jumping to a Palisade N or similar.

"I think what Hyundai is doing is establishing the N branding. 

I bought a Santa Fe 2 years ago, and my dealer had the genesis cars. I am still considering one. I think Hyundai is hoping that the client base is shifting and I think Kia telluride/palaside and even Santa Fe are very good cars for the money. If they had a N Santa Fe I would probably buy it.

I am total car guy and a nerd. I dislike the newer Elantra and Sonata designs but I’m hoping Hyundai has a nice refresh and I will consider a Sonata N. I want a bit sporty but not obnoxious. Honestly, I disagree and think Hyundai is doing a good job with the N. Look at all the attention it is getting here.

"Didnt say it was bad car, said its obscure car for their highest end performance treatment."
"So what else within the Hyundai lineup should receive the N treatment then? 

The Sonata? Midsize sedan sales are dwindling, and most Sonata buyers wouldn't care. Most enthusiasts wouldn't give a shit either because it's not a car they'd cross shop a used M340i or S5 with.

The Palisade? I mean...do you really want them to pull an Explorer ST with this?

The Tuscon? Maybe, but it'd still be like lipstick on a pig in the vein of the Explorer ST or Edge ST, and Hyundai's SUV or large CUV shoppers wouldn't care about it at all.

So the Kona remains the logical mass-market (relatively) pick out of their lineup apart from the Elantra. It captures the would-be Puma ST market, a vehicle I saw r/cars and various auto news sites begging Ford to bring over to NA a few months back..."

New or used: Either

Type of vehicle: coupe, sedan, wagon, hatchback, I am fine with RWD too

Must haves (in this order): fuel efficient, low running costs, low NVH, smooth ride

Desired transmission: auto

"I'll never forget racing a GT2 when I first got my Challenger RT like 12 years ago.

I was 20, driving around a college town in my basic-ass RT with some aftermarket wheels and a rear muffler delete, feeling like king of the world.

A silver GT2 pulls up next to me at a red light just as I'm waiting to get on the highway and head home, there was an orange Gallardo behind him. 

My windows are already down, Porsche rolls his passenger window down and it's another 20-something kid, he says ""wanna get on the highway and have a run?"" 

Well I'm heading that way anyway, feeling like hot shit, I figure I got like 400hp/400tq and a V8 so I holler *""Hell yeah!""* with a big stupid smile on my face lol 

I didn't really know shit about cars at the time, I hadn't even start binging Top Gear...

So moments later we're next to each other on the highway at like 45mph and he hollers *""GO!""* so I floor it and I start pulling away, but not in like a *""oh, I'm winning""* kind of way, more like a *""why isn't he also accelerating?'* kind of way.... but I thinking *""whatever, I'll just leave him""*.


So I'm rapidly glancing back and forth between him in my side mirror and the road in front of me, my rear bumper gets maybe 10ft or 20ft past his front bumper, and then I see the rear of the GT2 squat like nothing I'd ever seen before 

It starts moving so fast that I can't even follow it in the side mirror before it's next to me and I can't move my head fast enough to glance at it as it's next to me before it's already in front of me and within the span of a few seconds, before I can even comprehend what just happened, it's already 4-5 car lengths ahead of me and rapidly disappearing into the distance. 

The best part though was the orange Gallardo was right behind him the whole time, doing WOT also, and the exhaust noise when it flew by me just a few feet away was incredibly spectacular. The Gallardo's noise was more awe inspiring than to me than the Porsche's speed, which was like nothing I'd ever seen. 


I drove home with the biggest smile on my face, just so happy they played with me, that moment was the highlight of my life for a good 3 months, not realizing till years later that I was probably such a clown to them lol"

"I do understand. I was just recently cross shopping sports cars (RWD, 2-door, used under $10k). I looked at a lot of cars but one thing I didn’t get into was spec sheet racing. If you do this a Mustang or Camaro or Challenger will ALWAYS win due to their great return on horsepower per dollar. That’s the strength of high production sports car. But if that’s how you narrow your search you will be driving the same 3 cars forever. 

So while some people will definitely cross-shop, at this point a lot of folks know what a 86/BRZ is and it isn’t about horsepower. A person that wants power per dollar doesn’t actually want an 86. They’re always going to buy a muscle car. Toyota isn’t losing sales from those people because they were never going to buy an low displacement vehicle."

That being said I don’t see McCartney redoing Harrison’s parts because they weren’t to his liking as a testament that Paul is more skilled than George, but rather McCartney was (with Lennon) usually the primary songwriter and had a vision for what he wanted. If he didn’t like George’s take, he’s capable of playing, so it’s most direct for him to just do it."

"Drove it. I think it's currently one of the best BMW's you can buy. The styling (grille) and interior (ergonomics) look more ""BMW"" to me than the new M4 for example. It's very low, but feels secure, like you are driving a rocket to space. The change in name from ""6"" to ""8"" is interesting, as the 8 has a nice history. 

Downsides: prize - you can buy a Ferrari for that. Overall shape is not practical - small trunk for such a big car, and I've seen a video of an accident, where the firefighters struggled to get the passengers out. And the design does not entirely resemble the original 1989 8 series. 

Still, would recommend and wouldn't have any regret over buying one."
LAST ALBUM???? 😭😭😭😭
"I certainly wouldn't call it ""tiny,"" but it's as small as the old Ranger, or as small as it can get and still be moderately safe. Isn't that what people wanted?"
That's lethargic.  For people with an absolute budget of $30k I guess it's OK. Just for comparison a 2021 Honda Accord does 0-60 in 5.5 seconds and it's a family car not marketed as a performance car at all.
"We have two cars because we’re a suburban family with two cars. The second car is also pretty big for camping and hauling stuff, I don’t think any EV other than Cybertruck (if it ever comes out) is an adequate trade off for this car. 

As far as 100 miles, most commutes are less than 30 miles. It would be a heck of a drive for that beer."

Price Range: $40-75k

Lease or buy: Buy

New or Used: Used

Type of Vehicle: Sports car 

Must haves: None, open to everything

Desired Transmission: open to everything 

Intended use: dual track/daily use (track my current car around 12-15x a year

Vehicles I’ve either owned or considered: e46 M3, Subaru BRZ, GT350, 997.2/991.1 C2S/GTS, C7 Grand Sport, C8 with Z06 package. 

Not my first car 

Don’t need warranty 

I can do minor work but don’t want to deal with major work. 

Hey everyone, I’m in the position where I need to decide what to do with my car situation. For background I’ve owned a BRZ and an e46 M3 (both of which I tracked extensively and loved) before buying and keeping my current e92 M3 for daily use and track use around once a month. Yes I have owned other cars like the GT350 and a 991.1 GT3 which I absolutely loved and is one of my favorite cars ever but i have had to unfortunately  I had to get rid of them as I moved to a big city and it became financially unfeasible to keep and track more than one car. 

I love my M3, but I need to decide whether to dump around $15k in upgrades in brakes/cooling/suspension refresh (currently has 75k miles and I’ve already done rod bearings and valve cover gaskets) or go for a new car that hopefully won’t need too many modifications to hold up to extensive track use. My budget is around $65k but I can stretch to $75k if need be. I’m currently looking at 991.1 C2Ss, 981 and 718 Cayman GTSs as well as the GT350 and C7 grand sport. However after my experience in the e92 and the GT350 compared to my previous cars, I would prefer a lighter car and hopefully something slightly practical as this will be my daily that I track once (or twice) a month. 

Let me know what you guys think and I look forward to your recommendations! Thank you!"
"Its not going to hold value. It will do better than something like a Chevy Cruze or a 3 series, but its going to be a volume car. To the extent it keeps value you're going to be in an S2000 situation where you'll have to wait 15 years until most examples have been modded, crashed, or worn out to get good value.

I think this is a great car, but I see a lot of people trying to convince themselves they can buy this for 30 grand now, daily it and thrash it on weekends for a couple years and then sell it for 25 grand because its a ""special car."" Buy it if you like it, but understand its going to depreciate like a Miata."
"My area is chock full of people driving new Model 3s as second commuter cars. Commuter car doesn't mean cheap or shitbox to everyone: it's just the car you take on commutes. This product is definitely targeted at 2-3 car, upper[-middle] class households.

A Chevy Spark EV (or Bolt), or the Leaf all have pretty low rent interiors and NVH. We'll have to see the reviews, but Mazda is positioning themselves as a semi-luxury brand, similar to Acura. If it is a nice interior, having a nice place to sit for 30-60minutes twice a day is a very real thing people pay for. The Lexus ES sells extremely well when the Camry exists, after all. Remove range and sportiness from your priorities and this car is potentially competitive, but not a best seller."

"Hey, good lube is expensive nowadays"
"If your goal is to have the most comfortable, smoothest-riding SUV in your budget, you may as well put the Range Rover on your list. I wouldn't say it's the best value in the SUV world, but it's desirable, luxurious, capable, and has a surprisingly buttery suspension on the highway. The new Westminster Edition comes in at $105k and has just about every feature you could want, or move down to the HSE trim and just pick the features/packages you want. Consider picking the V8 as well. This is definitely a car you'd want to lease, not buy, given their iffy reliability history and how expensive repairs can get.

If you want to test drive some less over-the-top luxury SUVs, the BMW X5 M50i would be a great place to start. The Mercedes-Benz GLE580 would be its biggest competitor, and it may do a better job of keeping things smooth and comfortable. They both start at $80k or higher, and that figure goes up when you add options. But the dark horse that's worth talking about here is the Genesis GV80. I can't say whether it's quite as smooth as the others mentioned here, but the level of luxury is impressive for such a new brand, and the value is undeniable: The top-of-the-line GV80 3.5T Prestige comes in at $72k and offers far more than any competing brand for the price in terms of features. No options to select -- the Prestige trim comes stocked with absolutely everything. You'll need to try it out for yourself to see how it competes, but personally, if a 6-cyl engine will do the trick, that's the way I'd go in your shoes. Cost of ownership would also be a lot lower than the others listed here."
"If GM still keeps Camaro and gives it a redesign, I sure the value in FR Corvette wouldn't go that kind crazy.  

>if Porsche made it mid engine and removed the manual for the sake of performance

They probably would continue the manual if the 911 really becomes production 911 RSR. Porsche still offers manual in 718, so that makes sense. 

> everyone would flock to the old rear engine manual 911s for instant classic status.

The value in air-cool ones are already crazy."

"Location: United States - Southern California - willing to travel

Price range: $10,000 - $17,500 (flexible)

Lease or Buy: Buy

New or used: Used

Type of vehicle: Sports Car. Prefer Coupe, but sport sedan okay if the deal is right

Must haves: AWD/RWD no FWD, prefer a V8, but V6 is fine. Forced Induction a plus for lower powered motors. Looking for 300+ horsepower with ability to do some modifications and tuning (hence the desire for Forced Induction or an already powerful motor).

Desired transmission (auto/manual, etc): Either, if Auto, would prefer paddles or some ability to manually select gears

Intended use: Multiple uses. It will be my daily, but I work from home so its more of a weekend car that I will have to grab groceries with. When the car is driven, it will be spirited driving.

Vehicles you've already considered: Audi S5, BMW 650i, Mustang

Is this your 1st vehicle: No

Do you need a Warranty: No

Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: yes

Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: Maybe some suspension and brakes but not motor or transmission work

Additional Notes: Coming from an Infiniti Q40, was rear ended by a texter and car was totaled (rear suspension destroyed). I had done a good amount of work to the car and was pushing 340whp so I want something that is similarly powerful. Was going to hold out and get the Nissan Z, but the more i think about it, I don't want to get hit with massive dealer markups in the early stages of it being available. My plan is to get something that is powerful and fun and hold onto it for 18-24 months and then will likely sell and buy the Nismo Z (assuming that timeline works). Had a 98 A6 and love the Audi quattro system. Drove my buddies 09 S5 and I liked it as well, although felt a bit heavy compared to my Infiniti. Open to any and all suggestions, the research and process of searching is fun for me and I am not in a huge rush, been carless for 6 months at this point so fine to wait it out a bit longer to find the right option."

"Fun story, my band used to practice in a studio out in Midwood, Brooklyn, where they used to keep their gear. The amps all had that “zero with the line through it” logo stenciled on them. 

Saw them live a few times at places like L’amore. Always a good show. 

You know, Peter was huge. He only reluctantly quit his job operating heavy construction machinery to go on tour when the band got big. 

I remember driving around in the old van we used for the band listening to “Unsuccessfully Coping…,” singing along about the vodka and the steroids. Then the song finishes with a guitar solo. It’s like he has nothing more to say after she’s dead, and emotion just takes over. You can really feel it in the distortion and the feedback while “I know,” is repeating in the background.

"I was expecting the same. I live somewhere with a ton of Jeep people and a ton of truck people, but I can count on two hands how many I've actually seen. They're just not selling well at all. They can't keep them on lots because they're not making many in the first place is my guess."
"Under rated (Rwd, available manual, good power, reliable, similar to 350z) + inexpensive."
Hyped beyond true capabilities? ND Miata. I bought it because it was the most raced car in the world. Cmon Mazda was selling a car that you can just race. That’s awesome. Except they put in a crap transmission. Mine went though three before I changed model years. The spec racing series was killing transmissions all day. The other public was too. The solution. The spec series changed to a sequential gearbox. The public ND2 got upgrade and might be better off. But Mazda is no longer selling a race car.

The kona makes sense its barely meets the qualifications of a SUV it is a barely lifted hatchback. The turbo Kona is already a reasonably fun sleeper getting a performance tuned Kona would be a riot. seems the best of both worlds sporty and a bit of ground clearance so you won't have to worry about scraping on anything or dinging curbs.   The N brand is not going for ultimate track times they just seem to make something that is very competent that you COULD track it but they don't take themselves too seriously like a german car. I think that is ther perfect mix for most enthusiasts in this modern era where cars are so expensive that  most people can't afford to flip them as quickly and most enthusiests can't afford a project car/track car so their daily also has to provide this mix of practicality and fun. I don't think being lifted a few inches off the ground is going to really affect performance much as people think it will  but i guess we'll see when the car releases.   The germans already proved that you can make an suv handle fantastic so I have faith that other automakers will figure it out as well.

"I gotta counter this one. I also test drove the FRS when they first came out and was disappointed as well but that’s because I only was able to test drive it on some city roads and a little portion of highway. Neither of those two types of roads is what that car is about, nor is anyone hyping it up about how fast you can merge to traffic or driving it in a city setting. The hype of the car is at a track or on back twisty roads and it really does shine there. Getting to drive one years later in its element, on a track, really showed me I was unfair to the car for a long time and I understood why people loved it after that."

After that, it takes an eternity for the RPMs to get low enough to let the clutch out.

I suspect if it does come to the US it’ll probably be a 2.2L at least, perhaps a 2.5L probably pushing 200 lb-ft of torque or more."
It's basically a slightly taller GTI.
Golf club door! That’s wild.
Used German cars are a little risky. Have a mechanic look at it before you buy if possible. A poorly maintained German car is a nightmare. The Genesis has a better warranty than the Acura.

"I swear conservatives are the real snowflakes, it's like everything they do is projection or something."
They only have two albums. I'd just start from the beginning. Both albums are incredible.
"I think it'd be less the unibody construction, and more the size of the platform and the transverse/FWD layout limiting engine size. A unibody Durango can tow over 8000 lbs., and a GC almost 7500, but those have longitudinal/RWD layouts."
"I’ve test driven a 2019. It’s great, the only thing I didn’t like was a tendency to hunt gears a bit from the 9-spd transmission; they may have sorted this out since. 

For similar money you could also get:

-	Mazda CX-9: Similar space, luxe interior, slightly better handling, slightly less confident off-road
-	Toyota Highlander Hybrid: Similar space, similar interior, better gas mileage, slower
-	Acura RDX: Smaller, gorgeous interior and sound system, lots of fun to drive. 

I’d test drive the above 3 before making a decision either way."
One of the few albums I could listen to start to finish without skipping a single track.
"I told Alexa to play the latest Sturgill Simpson today like I often do. I was expecting cutting grass volume two. Which is one of the two albums he gave us last year, freaking unbelievable. And I was surprised with this great album."
I guess its to give us a 4 door variant that more closely aligns with the US customer base. We only buy CUVs right? How well did the NISMO Juke sell? I think that is the comparison to make
Yeah pretty much lmao
"It is pretty good. I like most of Modest Mouse, the brand new stuff is meh, but Isaac Brock is pretty solid.

"Devastating news for a generation (like my parents) for whom The Stones were THE BAND, and for a generation (like mine) that grew up loving them because our parents loved them.

"In their own genre, they were respected and big but not as big as others in the main genre of metal."
"I still think about grabbing one of those as a thrifty, fun commuter hatchback. Thoughts?"
"Price point is huge for it, IMO. I bought mine right before the '19's came out, got it for $34k OTD - no competitor came remotely close with features or performance at that price."
I know the actual material quality isn't the best for the price. But I find the Model 3 to be a very nice car to be in. More so than 90% of other cars I've been in.
"I'm actually looking at the 6 turbo right now, haha. I normally go for wagons but I can't get over the bulbus rear end on the 3."
"Such a bitch, I was 18 at the time and had nowhere to do my own maintenance so I coughed up a nice $1800 to have it done.  Even with its faults I still love the chassis and would totally get another if I found a good condition coupe"

"I agree. When you look at Hyundai's lineup and the ostensible goal of the N brand, there really isn't much better candidate than the Kona and the Elantra unless they are bringing over the i30n.

However the whole Veloster brand, not just the N, has been a bit of a head scratcher in terms of  market position and how long Hyundai has been keeping it alive despite so-so sales. I highly suspect it's a pet project of the CEO or someone in his family."
"The reason I took a Stinger than the G70 was twofold

G70 has no hatch, and consequently much much less cargo room.  Like you wouldn't believe how much less til you physically looking at both with the trunks open and the seat down.

Genesis dealerships are (anecdotally as I test drove cars) fucking terrible, and not to mention rare in my area of the world. I'd have had to drive 2.5 hours to the nearest one, as they flat out told me that Hyundai dealerships would not do warranty work on a Genesis **under any circumstances**."

Is it just confirmation bias or does it seem like there's been a lot of musicians go out within the last 60 days or so?
I guarantee there will be a resell  market for this car lmao
"As someone who is on the wait list for a C8, I was dreading your post that there was something majorly wrong with your C8, but ultimately I liked what you said. I tried a C7 Z06, but I just didn't have as much fun with it for some reason. probably just a ""different strokes"" thing, and I wouldn't have gotten a manual C7 either. Glad you like the CTR, I'd been recommending these to people who didn't want a Golf R for whatever reason, and glad to see owners like it a plenty"
"Imma say, Cybertruck."
"Well, the 86 isn't rice from the factory, and is at actually a japanese design. Oh, and it isn't named ""Supra"" of course. Even with manual, the Z4 Supra would be destined to be hated."
OH. Okay I see the possible confusion now lol.
"I’m not so sure.  Muscle car to me means fast in a straight line, not so great in the corners, slightly too large and reasonably priced.  I’m sure the electric version will make some crazy sounds too."
"I think that title goes to the C6 Z06 Carbon or C6 ZR1. A lot less weight than the C7s, and in the Z06 case the N/A 7.0L is an absolute monster. 

The C7 is the better car in many ways, but I think the C6 might be more of what the Corvette stands for, for many people. Slightly cheapo interior, great exterior looks, and absurd performance for the dollar."
"Definitely a more traditional build. Keeping it a highboy, still thinking about a color but I'm probably gonna go with the same blue that's on the grille for the car, it's gonna have a [checkerboard firewall](https://imgur.com/lq3GMIK.jpg) like that pic, I'm gonna look out for an I-beam front axle with a 5 inch drop (the tube one on it is around a 2 inch drop), still undecided about whether to use the 283. From there, it'll mostly be getting the interior straightened out. The guy I bought it from had a brand new Lokar shifter that went with it, I'm gonna get a bench seat for it, put a new steering column on it because the one in it right is some tacky one from the 80's, then put the glass in (previous owner gave 2 windshields with the car) and fix the trunk. It's a lot of work but it's got a great foundation to start with."
Wouldn't the ability to move shit around be included in a daily driver? It is to me. I don't actually like either car but there's no way in hell I'd daily a c8 for very long.

I drove a 2020
"Had a similar experience with another friend and the CX-5. The importance of test driving or even just going to a dealership cannot be overstated enough. 

This was a couple years ago, she needed to replace her SUV, asked my opinion. Magazines *rave* about the CX-5, so I pointed her in that direction. She was very different than my other example, and had done a TON of research ahead of time. We went to Mazda dealership to test some out... She hated it as soon as she got inside of it. No matter the trim level, she thought it seemed cheap on the inside compared with the other SUVs she was looking at. In the end she bought a CR-V. 

Point being, the consumer won't always agree with the subjective opinions of reviewers. The CX-5 was nice on the inside, but not the ""aspiring luxury"" that automotive publications would have you believe. And the friend didn't care about driving dynamics, so everything the CX-5 was praised for meant nothing to her and the CR-V better fit what she was looking for. But at least she tested several vehicles before making her decision."

"It's not even necessarily quality control, its how the engineering and quality control are applied. The parts used in race care are very much absolutely top quality and the quality control is arguably even higher than passenger cars, and definitely way stricter, it's just that longevity ans cost isn't a concern. Mainly because they're pushing things to the absolute limit: hitting higher temps, higher force, higher rpm, squeezing every little ounce of performance out of every individual part. Passenger cars in the other hand have quality control geared toward reliability and affordability, they'll readily sacrifice weight, performance and a certain amount of quality to make the part 10 bucks cheaper and last another 100 miles."

"We'll hopefully see much more from them down the road. If you're going to introduce a new brand to market, you want it to be seen. As much as I'd love Hyundai's N division to pump out some more sports cars right away, the reality is they don't sell like a Kona will. The Veloster established their legitimacy as a performance brand, and the Kona will help them create a market for future performance vehicles."
"Knew somebody set on a new Mazda. Absolutely loved the look of Mazda's and loved Mazda. Ended up test driving the CX-5 and HATED it.

Sometimes people really just don't care about cars like we imagine everybody does."
"Going to have to agree. I drove a ‘19 CTR and was impressed compared to my ‘18 WRX, but it didn’t warrant the price tag. I ended up with the 2.0T ‘21 Accord and the expectations that go along with it not being the CTR and am happy. I’d say the 2.0T Accord is the better choice for a daily by far, just has no expectations of being on a track."

This. There are a TON of cars out there that do 0-60 that fast and are street driven. They're drag cars on drag radials (or they switch out tires for the track.)

"I am generally willing to separate the art from the artist (why rob myself of enjoyment just because they suck?) but there are two exceptions:

1) I truly believe I am supporting damaging actions. Doing anything to support R Kelly makes it easier for him to pay legal fees and and perpetuate harm towards vulnerable women.

2) The personality of the artist is ingrained in the art. Louis CK’s comedy is about being an asshole. Well, that lost its charm when I found out what an asshole he really was. I don’t want to listen to Chris Brown sing love songs he wrote for women he then assaulted.

What other enthusiast car at that price point offers that amount of performance and customizability? N quite literally is a cheaper M division that focuses more on fun rather than outright performance, and I’m here for it.

However, other commenters are right. I think Hyundai would benefit from having a halo car. It would help raise awareness for the brand.

I really hope N becomes popular and we start seeing more N cars."
"I read it as a jab to Ford. Someone posted the video of sandy munro being very critical of blue cruise and favoring autopilot.  Elon leaned into it and basically said I’m not even impressed with our current version and it’s still better than blue cruise.

"We were planning on getting a Bronco (probably setting it up close to yours pricewise).  An accident forced us into the market early and instead of replacing the totaled RS with another, we went family first and got the 4Runner.  I had always wondered if I should've waited, but after seeing the reviews (which are all very complimentary) and doing a couple long family road trips, hauling shit around, etc there's no way I'd take the Bronco over it.  It doesn't have the added hp/torque... but it rides better, isn't hard top or soft top loud inside, and I can reliably haul the family, gear, and even tow stuff.  Once you realize the Bronco is just a refreshed Wrangler by Ford, it feels easier to disregard it."

"The car already has had a manual swapped into it. Toyota released a video about the supra a while back and in the video they made sure to get shots of the driver shifting with the gear stick. They placed a lot of emphasis on the driver shifting. Why would they do that when the car has paddle shifters? It would make more sense for the driver to shift with the paddle shifters on the steering wheel than the gearstick.

I'd especially love to see a current F-150 parked next to a mid 80's F-150 but my googling skills have turned up bupkis on that front.

"Previous compact pickups were pitched - and designed - as lifestyle vehicles.  The Maverick isn’t either of those, and Ford has been very careful to skirt around adventure imagery or discussion in their marketing.

And that’s what sets the Maverick apart from other compact pickup attempts: it isn’t selling solely, or even mostly, on the utility of its bed.  It undercuts the Escape hybrid by nearly $8k, and is much larger than the EcoSport while still being more fuel-efficient.  Even if it were a crossover, it would have a seriously-competitive value proposition, which means people will buy the Maverick whether it’s a truck or not."

"The C8 is a novelty because its the fabled mid engine Corvette. Once they start making them and people can walk into a dealer and just buy one like the Corvette's of old they will lose prestige because they will always be this design now.

"If you're hell bent on keeping it, learn to weld and weld some sheet metal over the holes. Brake lines can be fabricated with the correct tools. Before greenlighting the repair, make sure the car isn't so rusted that the structural integrity is compromised. check around areas where suspension components connect to the frame and make sure they aren't weak. If there's something like a strut tower rusted through, then the car probably isn't safe to be driven and there's not much that can be done to make it safe again."

"Supply chains are so messed up I'm not sure how much of the N-release has gone as planned, vs releasing what they can actually produce at this time.

Seems like they chose a popular vehicle type that doesn't really have anyone else serving up a performance variant of their own.  Mazda has the Turbo CX-30, but that's 50+ HP behind and 0.9 seconds slower in 0-60 from my quick googling.

What the market likes (SUVs) and what enthusiasts and YouTubers want (sports cars) are not the same.  Releasing the Kona N seems to make more sense than the Veloster N from the standpoint of actually moving units."

"Fun fact. For a one gear up or down shift, if done correctly by rev-matching you don't even need to use the clutch. It's advisable to use the clutch to avoid damage to the syncros but not 100% necessary.

I think what he meant by not slamming the clutch is that it really doesn't need to be fully disengaged to complete the shift. Just at or just past the engagement point is all that is necessary and would help avoid a money shift as you'll grind the dogs (what most people call grinding gears despite all the gears in the transmission being permanently meshed) before you ever actually fully engage the gear. 

When you get better at driving a stick and have rev-matching dialed in you can give clutchless shifts a try. Good thing to learn to do in case you ever need to drive a car with a failing clutch."

Also who's adding dual clutch transmissions to MK4 Supras? It's possible but it seems very rare and expensive."

"e:HEV is just the current Japanese market name for i-MMD (the previous systems were IMA) which works exactly as I mentioned above.

Its in full EV or Range Extender EV mode most of the time. Its not plug-in thats why I mentioned Range Extender. But the only part missing from a Plug In is the user charge ports and the only part extra from an actual EV is the Engine and the Clutch.

Honda's page on i-MMD even shows it in a very easy to understand diagram: https://global.honda/innovation/technology/automobile/hybrid/i-MMD-picturebook.html

The main reason why non-Plug-in Hybrids aren't considered a full stepping stone to EVs was they usually used some kind of power sharing setup where the electric motors couldn't run the car normally without the engine. This system dumps that and gives us a full EV architecture plus an engine to recharge/act as an overdrive option. Honda just did the interesting thing of not adding enough batteries to classify it a plug-in."

Which brings us to N, a letter that is totally coincidentally similar to another letter of the alphabet that a certain German car brand known for performance versions of otherwise pedestrian vehicles. Same here. They take pedestrian vehicles, performance them up, slap on a letter badge with some colors on the side, sell at higher margin. Or that’s the idea, anyway.

But unlike M-cars, they have no pedigree, no reputation, and the reference to M just reminds their buyers of what they presumably want but can’t afford. So, they are trying to manufacture “street cred” from whole cloth, and they are doing it by very obviously aping BMW, just as they were with the Stinger. Which is also why it will probably fail. People like originals, and a knockoff by definition implicitly admits inferiority to that which it copies. But I’m not a marketing guy."

"My list was Mustang GT and Ecoboost 2019, MX5 soft top 2019, BRZ 2019, 370z 2017, BMW 340i and even the Genesis G70 3.3 twin turbo.

I love the look of the Mustang, just really didn't like how it drove. I own an MX5 NC, and going to the mustang felt like I was test driving a huge van that was artificially feeding me back random information of the road, and changing gears become a chore as it just wasn't satisfying at all. I also felt like the car was far longer than it needed to be, and was a chore driving around our shopping car parks. Comparatively, the ND MX5 was a thrill to drive, even when just going to the local shops, or ringing out gears to 3rd entering the freeway. I wanted to change gears more and I wanted to slightly adjust the steering during corners as it just felt fantastic.

If I lived in a huge open area with speed limits way above 150km/h, then for sure I might lean more towards the higher power cars like the 370z, Mustang GT or Genesis G70. For my country/area/city though, I rarely get above 100, and feeling the roads and all the feedback through very well developed inputs is far more rewarding than having a larger car that accelerates faster. I really wanted to like the GT btw, I had dreams of sticking louvres on the rear window and putting fat tyres on it. It was of the faster, bigger cars one of the more fun ones to drive though, like it had way more feeling than the BMW/Genesis."

"I'm not going to say the 10th gen Si engine feels special (I have a rotary engine in my second car for a reason), but I do think the drivetrain feels more playful than it gets credit for. I've driven it back-to-back with a buddy's Focus ST (both small turbo 4s with a 6500 rpm redline making a similar amount of power). Along with the far superior shifter, the Civic just feels happier to rev. It's smoother as it gets up in the revs compared to the FoST, and the gearing encourages you to wring it out a bit (at least, with the updated 2020 final drive). It is still clearly a hopped up version of an economy engine, but a Honda economy engine is usually more exciting than anyone else's economy engine to start, so the Si does benefit from that."

"Not to take anything away from the plaids next level acceleration but I don’t think it’s fair to paint it as a fundamental breakthrough in acceleration vs horsepower in that way. First it’s a fact that more than a couple sports cars will do nearly 200mph with a lot less power and a lot more drag. Second, and perhaps more relevantly, more than a couple 1000+ hp cars are capable of the top end acceleration that plaid is. For example, plaid is not enough to dominate *heads up* TX racing events where you have TT L cars, GTRs, etc where everyone is at/above 1k awhp. So Plaid offers utterly amazing acceleration, but that description of it and the Taycan isn’t really accurate from a relative numbers or “science of it” perspective."

"I think this overlooks the used market. Like, the average car purchase is around the same as average annual income. But all income levels aren't shopping for new cars. Anyone spending as much as their salary on a car is an outlier that is going to be trapped in debt for a very long time."
"The Roadster, by the time it comes out, will no doubt have the new battery chemistry that Tesla is rolling out later this year. It will be a significant step up in power to weight ratio compared the Plaid Model S, even if they keep the rest of the power train the same.

The body would also be a lot lighter since it’s a 2+2 sports car.

So yeah, it will no doubt get close to the Rimac’s performance at $250k price… which would be pretty challenging for Acura to match in terms of straight line performance considering they haven’t had a lot of experience building high performance BEVs.

This may not be very popular, but looking at how the Plaid Model S achieved a Laguna Seca time that’s only 0.5s slower than the Senna with nothing but suspension and brakes upgrade and just 400lbs of weight reduction and a stock power train, I think the Roadster would dominate everything when it comes out, and not just drag strips.

Maybe science experiments like the multi-million dollar Bugatti Bolide or the AMG One would still win out, but as far as cars that will actually be mass produced and can be afforded by mortals, it will be the official sunset of the ICE performance era.

That’s why I’m super excited for the C8 Zora, the supposed 1000hp+ EV hyper car. If there is one product line that can delivery even more performance per dollar than Tesla, it would be the Corvette. I can’t wait for GM to announce record breaking performance for $180k lol."

"Except, it didn't. 

*The bill will also fund the installment of electric vehicle charging stations across the country with $7.5 billion.*
  

*But that allocation falls far below what industry experts believe is needed to create a robust national system. Consulting firm AlixPartners previously estimated it would take $50 billion to build a U.S. charging network that would be able to serve the number of electric vehicles expected by 2030.*

It also doesn't cover anything in regards to tax credits nor the long term viability of an EV. And even if you do install some additional charging stations, it's likely not going to be enough. The closest one is about 5 miles from me in the Denver Metro, and IIRC, there's only maybe 4 or 5 stations to charge. And for the millions who live in apartments, condos or only have street parking, what are they supposed to do?

/r/cars seems to keep putting the cart before the horse. Yes, there will be a transition to EV's, but it sure as hell isn't going to be in 2030."

"I don't. There was a lot of shit about, I was born in the mid-80's and it took until 2003 to find some music I actually loved, it was Iron Maiden but I also discovered Nightwish around the same story of time but it wasn't until 2007 when I really started to settle down. I was listening to all sorts of bands, new and old some were fleeting moments others stuck around and became beloved inclusions to my collection. 

The only 90's stuff I have is Overkill - Horrorscope, the 90's Maiden albums, some Sodom albums and some Dream Theater. That's pretty much it aside from some compilations and best ofs. I've got stuff from the 60's, 70', 80's, 2000's, 2010's and 2020's but barely anything from the 90's. It was a dark decade for music, even the mighty Iron Maiden produced some weak albums during that time. 

The 90's was not great for music, Dream Theater and Sum 41 are probably the best 90's bands and while some of the great bands around now started in the late 90's to lump them in with the 90's muck would be disingenuous to them. Nightwish were formed in 1996 but if you tried to sell them to me as a 90's band I'd not be interested, tell me Nemo is from 2003 and I'll jump right in.

So many bands tried to be Nu Metal, grungy or generally alternative even when it wasn't their natural state and  none of these genres are worth listening to. There were gems like the aforementioned Dream Theater and Nightwish and some bands weathered the 90's without changing their style to suit the period but many others just rolled around in the filth and it's never washed off."

"To piggy back on this (from a supplier's point of view): just stay away from Stellantis. They hire people on contract with no expectations of hiring them after and egos within management are difficult to deal with. The only plus is that whole their headquarters in Auburn Hills looks like a mall, it is the coolest of the 3 imo. You get to see prototype vehicles driving around on the first floor. GM's Pontiac facility is nicer but much more office like.

On the supplier side it can be very rewarding and fun depending on your company and your position but there are some pretty huge negatives when it comes to the reality of how certain customers operate. With the way things are going stick with OEMs. They are taking a lot more design in house so suppliers will be more or less order takers who have to deal with the negative choices the OEMs make. Biggest positive of being on the supplier side is that you know what everyone is working on before most people and that is great especially when people on here are hypothesizing what company's are/should do."

The LS7 is a whole different thing though. Try driving the SS in competition traction mode (go to the track mode and double tap the traction control button). If that works better for you then just leave it as is. Otherwise I'd at least get a light flywheel - LTs come with a 60 lbs dual-mass monstrosity for old-man drivability reasons (I guess). I would do other upgrades but you can get away with that one without doing a tune (although a tune is the next big thing that would help) and it won't be immediately noticeable if you're doing warranty work on other parts of the engine/car. I've had a few people drive my car and tell me how surprised they were at how quickly it goes up and down the revs (I do have more mods than just the flywheel).

"Not that I can justify owning a coupe as my only car right now, but yea I wish we had more options for manual-trans AWD, particularly Coupes.

Leading up to the reveal of the new Z last week I was digging through old rumors from a few years ago; there was speculation the Nismo variant of the new Z might be AWD, which would be mega cool if it retains the stick shift. Back then everyone was saying ""it'd cannibalize the GT-R!!"" but given that we haven't heard a peep about a successor to the R35 I'm starting to think it just might be true. And the Q60 the motor was lifted from does come in both RWD and AWD flavors."

Take a look right now - there's a single manual Veloster N in the northeastern US. My local dealership wouldn't let me place an order and they aren't expecting an allocation within the next three months. I understand that they're (almost definitely) phasing out the Veloster N for the Kona N, but if you want to appeal to the performance car market, this isn't how you do it. I really wanted a Veloster N but honestly that new Nissan Z has me excited. Considering going to my local dealership to place a deposit down once some more info comes along."

"That’s absolutely a legitimate concern, but even if TE2 is vastly more capable, I don’t see the Lightning’s capabilities increasing to match right away, barring some major leap forwards by a competitor.

It’s in the interests of the program to keep the capability jump from MY2024 to MY2025 to a reasonable level for the reasons you described.  There should be enough gap to encourage TE1 Lightning buyers to upgrade, but not such a huge gap that won’t be happy with their current truck if they can’t afford to - or worse, create the perception of radical jumps in capability every few years.

I test drove the same car as an automatic and the larger engine with the automatic and both felt super boring. The manual made such a huge difference."

I think you need to find some more challenging trails. I’ve always felt that off road is the only place I really prefer an automatic (apart from 5mph traffic). It just feels like when your attempting something sketchy/steep you can have a lot more control than with a manual and you don’t have to be worried about the clutch all the time. To each their own though.

Even stock they’re quite underrated and can hang with many ~300hp cars, but they tune easily. Budget for an upgraded clutch if you get the manual.

"I was young myself but asked by a coworker to go to a buy here/pay here place with him to help him pick out a car. Enough said.



Okay, get there and there are couple of used late 80's/early 90's Dodge options. One being your grandma's four door that seemed to be in okay shape. The other one was a sportier looking something another with at least a broken transmission mount. Of course my friend went with the sportier, broken car.

There is no negotiation on the price. Honestly, the price of the car was never brought up or listed. It was simply a matter of how much my friend said he could afford per week. Such a trap. The good news is after paying for a period of time they'd let him come back and, for more money of course, get into an even worse situation with a bigger piece of crap. All repairs had to be done in house with their mechanic to, you know, save the customer money.

I was young and honestly didn't know shit about finances, car buying, or mechanical issues on cars. That was over 20 years ago. Today I would just tell someone to take their money to a casino and put it on 17 rather than buying a turd from a lot like that. It's a better bet.

But in actuality I really wouldn't let a friend go there. I'd do everything I could to talk them into hustling up a grand or two and just get something that runs rather than get caught up in that I don't even know how high of an interest rate situation. Even with the used market the way it is now, those places really shouldn't be an option."

"I dunno man, I have a 2021 4Runner with a 276hp 250+ torque V6 going through a 4+OD transmission and… well.   The extra gear isn’t helping much.   Any incline on the highway at all, even 1 degree and it shifts to 4.  So a slight wave and you get to listen to and feel an engine and transmission have an argument about where to eat, what to watch, and which paint color to put on the wall all at the same time.   

I don’t know what would help the situation.   I think that SUV needs a tiny Turbo to have some low RPM torque.  

The V6 in it only has torque in the middle of the range.  3000Rpm+. It redlines at 5500, so you don’t have much to work with. It only moves if you thrash it.   

The matching of a Transmission to an engine is important as the engine and transmission them selves I think.  But that’s just like… my opinion man…"

">	I suspect that Ford is leaning way more into the latter than the former. I think I’ve assumed that most of the folks who buy midsized trucks (Ranger, Tacoma, Colorado, Canyon, Frontier... am I missing any?) are more likely to eventually increase size up to a full-sized pickup than go down to a compact pickup.

At the same time though, it’s been about 10 years since an actual compact pickup has even existed. Maybe it’s not most, but I’d assume that a good chunk of people buying new midsize trucks are doing so because thats the smallest pickup you can buy without going to a 12 year old used Ranger."

"For those curious who might buy this, I’ll give an insight why I would: 

We drive about 30 miles a day for our commute, probably closer to 20 soon, we have home charging and are a 2 cars household. We basically only go to the gas station 3 times a month. Perhaps just twice. The amount of times we’ve drove over 100 miles in a day in the last year 2-3 is definitely less than 20. We have years where we’ve driven less than 5k. 

In other words, this vehicle fits out *needs* just fine as the commuter car.

The issue is the price. Right now a base trim FWD RAV4 is $27k. The issue is exclusively the price. If they can get it even close to that RAV4, then it’ll be a 50/50 which one I’d get. If it’s even close the the RAV4 prime then it’s dead to me. 

I’m optimistic that the low desirability of this vehicle would shoot the price down to where it becomes a very good financial decision for us."
"I mean it all depends on how quickly you shift... with rev-matching enabled the Vette actually holds the proper RPM for each selected gear, going both up and down the gearbox. If your shifts are on the slow side you won't get any driveline shock.

Stock LT/LS cars don't like quick shifting though - they have like 60 lbs of dual-mass flywheel to keep them spinning. With a light aluminum flywheel, lighter clutch assembly, lighter pulley, stiffer engine mounts and a tune you can really have fun with it - but you do add some NVH."
Honestly the ZF8 in the newer 328i makes that car feel faster than it ought to.

Thats more on brand than creating an AWD car to compete with the really fast EVs."

""This Corvette is one of 1,000 that is a manual that has torch red paint, a black interior, and silver 5 spoke rims."" It's so ridiculous. STFU and drive your mass produced car."

However, to your original question, it 100% depends on what you mean by ""you have all the parts"". Is the transmission one huge unit, or an empty bellhousing and a bunch of gears? because there no way anyone is figuring that out without some sort of guide or knowledge of transmissions. Same for the motor. Assembled and ready to drop in, or are the pistons and crank out?"

"This isn’t the corvette ZR1 though.  99% of corvette owners will never track their car; it’s like people that buy huge lifted trucks and never tow anything - they just want “the option to.”

Obviously you *can* track the vette z51 model and up,  but let’s be honest here - unless you are a professional racer, the performance really doesn’t matter in the real world.  You can’t possibly push even a base corvette to its limits anyway.

So for driving enjoyment, the automatic corvette is objectively not as entertaining.  It’s exactly why people love the gt350 even though it’s slower than a base 10 speed automatic mustang GT.  Why people love the cayman gt4 when it’s obviously much slower than any of the porsche turbo models.

That should be the entire point of a sports car (imho - your mileage may vary)."
"Money shifting is not intentional. It usually happens when someone is trying to accelerate and shift as quickly as possible, like in a drag race, and instead of going 2nd to 3rd, they accidently shift back to 1st, which means engine go bye bye because it over-revs"
"Agree. The racing in *Le Mans* feels so much more visceral, and a lot of it is due to the cars actually being on (or over) the limit - squirrelly braking zones, cutting corners, losing traction on the exits. I gotta say, most scenes in the two modern films look like parade laps in comparison."

That corroborates my point. The hype got me to overlook all the misgivings I had and want one anyway. The delays and missteps gave me time to reconsider.
I think we’re both right. A car doesn’t have to be disappointing to be overhyped. It can be perfectly adequate but overly talked about. It was definitely polarizing but even “negative hype” is still hype. Everyone was talking about it either being this amazing car or some huge failure and it’s just…ok. Again all my opinion though.

"A couple of things are going on,  but the biggest is that more gears allow the transmission to let the engine stay in the power band that works best. Put simply gears exchange speed for power or vice versa. Higher gears for low RPM efficiency at high speeds, but quickly shift to a lower gear that puts the motor closer to the RPM peak for performance, just like on a bicycle.

The other factors are they tend to work faster now as the computers have gotten better and programming better, and they are smarter about working with the engine."
I once did a 5 to R shift in my car because I came back from driving a 6 speed manual. That was a bad move. But as you described the gearbox made a nasty grinding noise and basically blocked me from shifting into R

That's more a factor of the current used car market than a reflection of anything about the 86. 2-3 year old SUVs and Trucks were selling for at or above MSRP for comparable new models earlier this year.

"I made a similar trade in move for entirely different reasons. When the C8 first launched I went looking for a C7 because some dealers were selling them at $15k under sticker to clear them out for the C8s. So I got a C7 well under sticker. About 5 months into owning it somebody crashed into me while I was stopped at a red light. A new car doesn't feel the same after a wreck. That plus Vettes really are a summer only car. I live in the Midwest. I drove it in the snow on all season tires. Not fun. Trade in value was $9k over what I paid for it new 14 months earlier.  Didn't get a Type R, but an RDX that has the Type R engine. The engine is detuned in the RDX but the 10 speed transmission helps a lot to make it a peppy compact SUV."

When did RGB lighting become a *luxury* car feature?  I would honestly think the car is even better if it didn't come with all the ridiculous RGB lighting crap.
"> The N brand never seems ready to commit, and seems to dodge obvious match ups against segment leaders. It also doesn't seem like they're trying to build ""the best"", they're still going for that ""90% of the performance for 80% of the price"" value performance package. There's little prestige to be earned from avoiding challenges and financial sensibility. People admire rockstars, the N brand is an accountant.

They can't push the performance envelope too much due to the 10 year powertrain warranty. The 3.3T in the stingers/G70s are very conservatively tuned vs the Germans as evident by the ""why bother having it"" launch control maxing out at like 2.5k RPM, and that a simple piggyback unleashes an extra 100hp/100lb-ft torque. 

That being said, I think they've done a good job of offering cars that offer a LOT of fun for cheap. I don't think every performance brand needs to chase after being the best in their class in terms of performance in order to succeed. Arguably they are best in class in terms of outright fun FWD cars. Watching the latest Kona N and elantra N reviews you can see how much fun the drivers are having. I think most reviewers have commented that while a CTR would easily beat a VN around a track, the VN is more fun to drive and has more character. I see that as a win for Hyundai, especially because they were most likely benchmarking the Golf GTI/R when they were developing the VN/i30N.

However I agree with the OP, they should've brought the i30N and made a N version of the G70 to better round out their performance brand."

Going (60mph) 100km/h in fifth the RPMs are sitting around 3000. I downshift to 4th and get my RPMs up to like 3.8-4k or something and put it into 4th. While passing I get up to like 140km/h and put it back into 5th pretty much as I’m going by the car. Pretty fun lol. Downshifting and rev matching is very satisfying. I hope you have fun!"

It was an absolute blast to drive, and hilariously practical for what it is. You can fit 2 passengers easily if uncomfortably as long as nobody is too tall. 

Put some good tires on it (I did pilot super sports, but the new oem tire seems way better than the originals) and it'll take corners way faster than any sane person should on the road. 

If the reviewers are right that the shock damping is better now that solves one of the biggest issues with comfort, and a dash of extra power never hurt anyone.

I only got rid of the frs due to 2 huge hail events and after repairs it was never as solid as it was originally."

"It is completely down to ABS and stability control tuning. That's why cars that fail could revamp the tuning and pass again like the Rav4.

Sporty cars can't have as aggressive stability systems as a other cars since it would panned for being to intrusive while driving.

When you buy a car new in a country or area where they use salt on the roads in winter you really need to use a few layers of zinc primer and a few layers of epoxy mastic to keep it from rusting. This will do a really good job of protecting the metal. Every year or so I would inspect it to touch areas up where the mastic has broken or chipped off.
They knew what they were doing by making “state of the union” the album opener lmao
"To mirror what others said, a money shift is a downshift that causes a *mechanical* over rev. To clarify, the engine has a rev limiter, and so you cannot take it past redline in a normal gear. But if you’re going at 80 mph in 5th gear, and your car’s 2nd gear at redline is 50 mph, and you put it into 2nd trying to go into 4th, the moving mass of your car will drag your engine speed past redline, which can result in valve float, meaning the valve springs aren’t returning the valves out of the way of the piston fast enough, resulting in valve to piston contact and an invasive wallet biopsy."
"> I'm still trying to figure out how people can afford to do this.

Saving over time and/or selling a different vehicle, I suspect. Buy a swap kit, then pick up the engine/trans off a smashed vehicle when it pops up, and start building. It's certainly not a ""well I'm going to do this next week"" for most people."

"That's the point of getting a car with little or no depreciation.  Which car, can be hard to figure out though.

I bought my Viper when it was 20 years old.  Not too much more depreciation left on it.  I also financed 100% of it because the rate was so cheap.  I was maybe upside down for the first couple of months.  By the time the car has been paid off, I should be able to sell it for a minimal loss or even a profit that could roll in to a nice down payment on something like an Emira and I'll wind up with another 40/50k car payment, but I'll have a 90/100k car instead.  I'm not suggesting a new Emira will hold its value as well as the Viper, it just another car I am interested in."
"The problem with the Kona N is that nothing about it makes sense. Everyone was waiting for an AWD, hot crossover/hatch... Thing... And instead what they gave us is a FWD hot hatch meant for use in 3rd world countries. Whether they want to admit it or not, AWD sells cars. Especially in Canada and states where they get a lot of snow. At this point, AWD is expected as an option in crossovers if you go above the base trim. I was actually somewhat excited for the Kona N when it had the prospect of AWD. Our roads here are shit, and that goes double for some of the best driving roads. With enough suspension travel, they're still fun and the AWD helps you to rocket out of the turns as the fun is more about short blasts of acceleration than going high speed. 

Where Hyundai messed up, in my opinion, is making the Veloster the N model for North America. The styling is too polarizing, and the use of FUBU 2001 Baby Blue for all of the accents is weird. The people I know who waited for the Focus ST almost a decade ago were not interested in a weird three door hatchback that sticks out like a sore thumb. In comparison, the I30 N would have been up their alley as something subdued but still a great drive. 

The Elantra N looks good, I just want to see if they've fixed the problem of the poverty taillights. I'm nitpicking here, but at night, compared to it's contemporaries, the new Elantra looks like it came from the early 2000s with it's LED-less tail lamps. Again, probably me being picky, but it bothers me that they make such a futuristic looking compact sedan... But it looks 20 years old at night from behind. However, out of all of the N models, I think this one will be the hit. The Kona? Ehhh... Might be a good deal if production picks up soon and it spends 6+ months on the lot."
"I *think* that this will sell well, but I do think there's going to be some questions once the non-deposit reservations need to be converted into full-on sales. 

This seems to check a ton of boxes in a missing market segment. It's cheap, good MPG, it's small, it's short (easy loading/unloading the bed), it's simple. I also think it has the advantage of being a Swiss-Army vehicle. It can do a little bit of anything people might theoretically need to do, and I think that is increasingly important for new vehicle buyers -- thus the drastic upswing in CUV sales and downswing of standard sedans. 

(That also brings me to a fun side conversation about how similar the Maverick and Santa Cruz are in terms of what they accomplish in the segment on paper, but how drastically different the two companies are marketing them. Ford is straight-up selling this as a quaint, environmental city truck. Hyundai is selling this as the glorious return of the Baja, a brave little explorer for adventuring and camping. Look how different the two marketing images look between the [Maverick](https://www.ford.com/cmslibs/content/dam/brand_ford/en_us/brand/trucks/maverick/2022/3-2/FRDNTRX0264_Ford_Maverick_Blue_Truck_Girl_Band_Loading_FlexBed_495A5166_02_Ext_Alt_Social_100dpi_LR_desktop.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1440.1440.jpeg) and the [Santa](https://www.autotrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022-hyundai-santa-cruz-truck-bed-towing-bike.jpg) [Cruz](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/960x720/https://www.forbes.com/wheels/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Hyundai-Santa-Cruz-BH_960px_764E8156.jpg).) 

On the other hand, the hoard of general car-buying folks are fickle and weird and tastes can change in an instant. I think there's absolutely a chance these are a flop, but I think the way that happens is if consumers decide that after pricing a Maverick to the trim they want, they could get a Ranger for not that much more. Based on the popularity of compact/subcompact CUVs I don't think that's as likely, but it's still a possibility."
"It feels like the transmission is... fragile. I think a lot was done to save weight in it for efficiency purposes, but it doesn't feel robust at all. Then they paired this super lightweight, snappy transmission with super soft engine mounts, so when you do actually shift quickly, you get jerking and bucking. Feels like two different departments built it LOL.

But it could be worse. There's little to no rev-hang, which is a plague in modern cars."
"Don't really need to focus on shifting once you get the hang of it.

But it *is* nice to not have to go constantly 1-2-1 in traffic jam. Or at least I'd imagine it is.

Same really for truckers and their quarter million gears

> Having an automatic gearbox opens up the drivers hands to focus on things other than controlling the car.

"Hackett was always going to be temporary, and his departure wasn’t so much an ousting as his time being up.  The board brought him on as a holdover and a sock puppet: the executives who were actually running the show, like Farley, were the real picks for CEO.  Those candidates knew - and the board agreed - that they would have a tough time as CEO if they were hamstrung by the fallout of some of the hard choices they had to make, such as killing off cars.

"I managed to order my '21 VN for under MSRP directly through the dealer, was shipped from Korea so I had to wait months for it. It took me almost 2 months to find a dealer who wasn't awful.

 I had a Fiesta ST before this so I wanted another hot hatch, the options were the GTI, Golf R, CTR or the VN. After testing all of them I went with the VN for a few reasons. The GTI was too boring and vanilla, it didn't feel like it had much soul driving it, the CTR was great but 12k more, the golf R was nice but suffered the same problem with the GTI and again was more expensive.

 What I got was a hot hatch that was extremely fun, extremely engaging, significantly faster than my Fiesta ST and performs way above it's price segment. 

 I think the Kona N was a predictable move in today's automotive climate, more people will be looking for a CUV than a hatch or sedan and having a performance version will likely attract the CUV families with a car enthusiast who is forced to compromise due to kids/wife.

 The Elantra N again is a predictable move, it's basically the I30N fastback for America similiar to how the Veloster was America's I30N alternative.

 Hyundai's biggest problem is the dealer network, this isn't a Hyundai issue either, dealers in general can be pretty terrible. The problem Hyundai faces is taking a new performance brand and trying to get recognition when dealerships exist and 80% of them are scumbags. Honda dealers are doing the same thing with the Type R but people are already aware of the R brand so it's less of a problem because they will shop around instead.

 Hyundai as a brand is making great decisions for the N brand imo given the current auto climate but dealerships are a cancer and kneecapping the brand."

EV should provide excellent towing performance too with the low end torque and regenerative braking.
"It may still be difficult to hit the city mpg numbers, because oftentimes automakers optimize certain things for the EPA test cycle as opposed to any real world condition.  Small displacement turbos are especially problematic with this, because fuel economy very quickly drops off as the turbo spools up.

Mild hybrid systems help out somewhat, but the EPA numbers will increase alongside real world numbers.  You may still fall several MPG short, but it's better to fall 5 mpg short of 25 vs 23.  

The best advice to raise city mpgs is to be slower off the line and pay attention to traffic slightly further ahead.  The less you speed up and slow down the better, leave room in front of you to coast and try to time your driving so you aren't on the gas as you approach a red light.

Your fuel economy with a 2L turbo is pretty close to what I get in my caprice wagon, which is over 25 years old, weighs weighs 500 lbs more, and has a 5.7L V8 (granted I don't have AWD).  My drive cycle is mostly suburban as opposed to highway or urban, but big lazy V8s also don't seem to suffer in stop and go as much as small turbo engines."

"Yeah that's the thing. It really should have been a non-luxury sports sedan. We used to have *shitloads of them*. Hell, GM typically made like 30 at a time (granted it was probably 3 cars with some badge engineering, but the point is there was a market). But once carmakers stopped bothering with sports cars, the only ones who continued to do performance were luxury carmakers. And that's totally ruined what sports sedans are supposed to be, or at least were. Now they have to be loud and powerful and raw and also simultaneously isolating and quiet and tame. They have to be luxurious, and they have to be complex and a nightmare to own out of warranty. Nobody seemed to be able to untangle the thread, least of all Kia, so they totally flunked the marketing. They should have lead with the *base* stinger, to further differentiate it from luxury marques. Then it would be ""for not much more than a camry, you can have a well equipped liftback with rwd/awd and a 2.0T."" And then the GT would be a performance version of a commodity sports car, and thus not have to compete with the Germans on luxury or refinement. With better marketing, they could have built a worse car and sold way more of them, and it would have been more fun to drive as a result."

Hummer isn't a practical purchase for anyone who really needs/wants a truck for truck stuff.

edit:

\*Should be noted Ford has delivered cars to consumers for a hundred years, unlike Rivian, who hasn't delivered much of anything to anybody. Maybe some vans to Amazon? Unlike Tesla, Ford has built a truck or two. Tesla is delaying the cybertruck to focus on Model Y production or some such because the Model Y exists and is profitable. It's a smart, uncomplicated, wrinkle-brained decision on behalf of Tesla's accountants, because the cybertruck doesn't exist beyond prototypes, but the Y sells faster than it can be produced. So, it stands to reason an electric F150 isn't vaporware because it's an electric version of a truck that already sells in the millions of units."

"Really sorry to hear you failed. If it makes you feel better, I can do you one better.

I failed my first driving test about 30 feet from the end of the test. I was in the parking lot of the DMV (the test center) about to finish the test. I just had to pull into the section of the parking lot where the test ends. 

Somebody stepped off the curb and I didn’t see them because it was in the blind spot of my A Pillar. The car moved maybe 3 feet before I saw them and hit the brake. Mind you, I was in a parking lot going less than 5 MPH, but I moved just enough. I automatically failed because I didn’t yield to a pedestrian, which is an auto fail in California. 

Don’t bear yourself up. I know you’re eager to get driving, but you’re going to pass eventually. Sometimes you just get really really bad luck in life and there’s nothing you can do about it."

Kia Stinger. I had to go to three dealerships to even get a test drive because they wanted to run my credit before I touched the damn thing. It was quick but the interior quality reminded me of my sisters Optima which fell apart a year later. I got a Lexus GS350 with no fuss a week later.

Hey guys,

It was my car that was involved and a mistake was made. There were no intentions of doing anything out of the norm. In fact, you'll notice in the video that the car was going very slowly in front of the crowd. This was intentional because we've all watched too many YouTube videos of this sort of thing happening and wanted to make sure that nobody would get hurt should anything unexpected happen. Once the car was past the crowd the accelerator was pushed in a straight-line as I have done many times in the past when the rear snapped violently. The car was going ~30mph at that time. The car has been driven for 4700 miles and has been driven with DSC off many times including in the rain and never has the car snapped so violently just from accelerating. I chalk it up to several factors including cold temps (low 40s), cold tires and incorrect psi (more on that later) and of course driver error. More judicious use of the throttle should have been exercised. MDM mode was not used because MDM is too quick to intervene and cuts power prematurely (or maybe not).

Usually when the rear breaks loose, it does so progressively and steering correction will suffice. However, you can see in the video that the front tires are turned slightly to the right indicating opposite lock was put on the steering trying to prevent the car from doing a complete 180 however there wasn't enough real estate to counter how violently it snapped - though admittedty the gravity of the snap required immediate full oppo lock which was misread. I'm not sure why some are saying that no steering input was made because it was - one could argue it should have been sooner but again usually a little wiggle just takes small steering input and power through not a full-on immediate opposite lock as was needed in such a big snap - to me it actually seemed like it was happening in slow-mo although the vid makes it seem like it happened so fast. As the car started to correct it became apparent that there was no way out except over the curb which is where I put on the brakes and tried to straightline the curb as much as possible to avoid hitting the curb at an angle which would cause a lot of damage and potentiality flip/roll the car.

I've driven many high hp rwd cars including vipers, porsches, corvettes, and formula cars and I've graduated from formula racing schools and have years of training in advanced car control and plenty of track time. Heck I remember day one of Formula school, half of the first day was spent on the skid pad learning how to keep a car from spinning if you lose traction. Maybe I need a refresher since it's been awhile and I've been driving AWD Audis for the past few years. Some of those other RWD cars I mentioned will snap fiercely and you have to be on extremely high alert, however my experience with the M4 has been that it tends to not snap so viciously in a straight line - but this time I was wrong. I would caution anyone thinking that it can't happen to them (count me as previously one of those) that anyone can make a mistake. I'm thankful that nobody was injured from such a mistake. Surprisingly, the car seems to be driving just fine with the only damage being the right plastic guard underneath the bumper which can be seen in the video. Surprising I know.

I mentioned earlier that I had incorrect PSI - let me explain. My PSI was low, so I inflated it a bit with a pump with an analog tire guage which of course is very imprecise compared to a digital gauge. I noticed that my right tire pressure was 1.5psi off of my left when viewing the PSI from the BMW onboard digital gauge (you can only do this while driving). However, as my car had been pulling to the right from day 1 of delivery (there's a big thread of many complaining about that on these forums). Miraculously, the car drifted to the right to a lesser extent with the right tire PSI being slightly higher than the left and so I was playing around with the idea of keeping it that way for a short time- however I knew that I needed to put the PSI equally across both tires but I just failed to do that before going to the meet. I have no idea if unequal PSI left to right contributed to the right rear spinning so differently than the left.

Anyways, I know I'll be ridiculed and called an idiot (and rightfully so) but I think many of you also know that I didn't do anything intentionally out of the ordinary or unsafe. I'm not sure I was even trying to show off as acceleration happened when the car was past the crowd and it's not like a powerslide or burnout or anything of that sort occurred.

I also think the M4 is a fine car and I have no complaints about the amount of power or torque or tire width or grip or anything. In fact, the whole reason I got the M4 is because it's not AWD and I like the rear moving around a bit. Mistakes happen and I've learned a lesson - and from now on will keep DSC on when driving around because there's too much at stake to make a mistake while driving - no matter how good or bad of a driver you are. Thanks for hearing me out. It certainly has been a humbling experience."

Got heem!
"I was able to go from the top of 3rd gear to the 2nd gear (in stead of 4th I was aiming for).  The tires let out a massive chirp before I slammed the clutch back in.

If you are shifting properly, as you pull back, you're also pressing to the right, to catch the next gear up.  If you pull the lever back, and towards you, you will catch the previous gear."
Wow. RIP. One of the greatest.
"Wrong. In a true 4x4 engage 4lo put it in first gear and engage your center locker. Take your feet off everything and coast down the hill at about 1mph. No brakes involved and you can just crawl around.

Very sad
"The top engines for the Subaru Crosstrek and Outback would be so much more fun if available with a manual. The old Outback XT & Forester XT are truly dead these days; the manual turbo station wagon dream is no more. The VW Alltrack can be tuned to some really good power numbers, but it's not the same.

The Kia Stinger basically had a manual option in the form of the Genesis G70 manual, but it was 4 cylinder & RWD only. I can't complain too much though.

The Alfa Romeo 4c would be a classic if a manual option existed. Instead it'll be a footnote."
Evo where you at
Because US law requires them.
What an awful name. I'm not sure who's coming up with these but they really couldn't come up with anything else?
Why would there be added rotational mass? The tires would be the exact same size. They are just a grippier compound.

"Or they could just have better customer service at their dealerships.  

Most luxury brands treat their customers better, but you don't *need* to be a luxury brand to have friendly and helpful dealers.

The problem with trying to create a premium/luxury brand, is that a huge part of what draws people to a premium brand is the badge and name recognition/cachet.  Somebody who's shopping Mercedes and Audi is going to be hesitant to cross-shop a novel brand that nobody has ever heard of - and ""Kia is the parent company"" is not exactly a selling point for those types of buyers.  This is why Genesis (see?  they actually already tried it), is flopping hard.  This is why Eunos (Mazda's attempt at an upscale brand) never took off.  it takes persistence, good marketing, a phenomenal show-stopper product (see: Lexus breaking into the luxury scene with the LS), a strong parent brand, and plain old time to build a reputation, to create a successful luxury/premium brand.  Kia/Hyundai just isn't really there yet."

It got the spirit of endurance racing right but you’re not making eye contact on the Mulsanne and you can’t just upshift and pass someone. I don’t think it would be a worse movie if they got stuff like this right.

Arguably the worst band to ever have existed.
"Numbers get weird when I had a Stinger GT as a trade for the C8 but basically the C8 was 103k Canadian after trade in, taxes etc and I traded the C8 in for 116.4k. Now factor in that I have a 13% sales tax and due to the shear amount of equity in the C8 I didn't pay any sales tax (normally I'd pay about 5.5k on the Type R) so I made about 18.8k

However if for arguments sake I remove the fact I traded in my Stinger on the C8 that number comes out to 108k after TTL for the C8 so even then I'd make 13.8k with the tax savings, or even without the tax incentives I'd make 8.4k alone on the trade in if I didn't have my Stinger.

Basically my C8 was 108k after TTL as just a straight up cash purchase and I could easily sell it private for 125k without issue. That number would go even higher as most sales don't even really seem to care about the options of the car. I probably could have purchased a base C8 for like 85k after TTL instead of the 108k and still sold the thing for maybe 120k, profiting a ridiculous 20k+ extra on top it."

"If TRD can make money for Toyota by making an avalon into an angrier looking avalon, you'd think a brand that actually promotes performance cred would help Hyundai.

Car peopleknow modern Hyundai for genesis, the stinger, and the N brand: non car people know it as that brand with completely anonymous cars from the 2010s whose price was proportionate to their owners credit score. I can understand them wanting to change their appearance to the public, it's just bizarre they didn't N-ify the sonata/elantra/Santa Cruz before their unknown models."

"""Grunge"" was a convenient box the media created. Once Eddie Vedder was on the cover of Time magazine in 1992-93? It was a corporate construct. The uniting factor in that music at the time was the roots that it came from and the creative ways it was used. Black Sabbath, Zeppelin, King Crimson, The Misfits, The Pixies, all played some role in their creativity back then. Even RATM and NIN who were way out of the ""genre"" were influenced by those bands."
Pre-order are different than actual orders. I bet only a fraction of those reservations convert into actual sales.

It's rather paradoxical that I both love the car and also freely admit that the whole N brand is probably going to go absolute nowhere.

It's a real shame too because the VN is hands down the most fun car I've ever touched. Virtually any car comparison will admit that it almost always wins the fun factor. This, as an enthusiast is at the peak of qualities imo. The car handles like it's literally not capable of losing control and makes peak torque under 2k RPM's while sounding perfect straight from the factory for under 30k when I got it.

"There is a bit of rev hang, but that's across the entire industry due to emissions standards. Even autos do it if you focus on the tach.. Keeping the throttle just barely open for a second instead of ""slamming"" it closed when you lift-off the pedal creates less carbon buildup. You can get rid of it with a tune. But if you're gonna trade it for the Blackwing that might not be worth it to you.

I've gotten used to it and have no problem launching the car when I wanna have some fun, but a tune is right around the corner now that it's almost got 30k miles on her."
"I would do dirty, dirty things for an E Class coupe with a manual."
"I think N is just not made for you. Over here in Europe, especially in Germany, the i30N sells like hot cakes. Especially when they first released it, it was very competitively priced

Diorama was amazing.
Of course not. I figured in an off-road situation your revs would be so low you'd risk stalling the engine or overworking the clutch. It seems that is inaccurate.
Here's an excellent [full-length clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL614PU-EQE) of Charlie doing his thing on Jumpin' Jack Flash in 2006. RIP Charlie.
You're thinking of Randy Rhodes who was the lead guitarist for Ozzy when he went solo.
These kids were only 15 when they recorded that.
"Not to be mean but, woo hoo, who cares. I'm not sad you had to down grade to super great car from an extremely nice car only upgrade later to an extremely nice car."
">the front suspension is double-wishbone of all things (rear is multilink).


Most modern pickups and true SUVs run a double wishbone independent front suspension. There are a small number of vehicles like the Wrangler, Jimny, 70 Series Land Cruiser, Ford Super Duty pickups, and Ram Heavy Duty pickups that still have solid front axles, but most pickups and true SUVs, like the new Bronco, Hilux, or Ranger run a double wishbone IFS. The Land Cruiser 100, 200, 300, and Prado all run double wishbone IFS too. 

Despite the presenter repeatedly mentioning the Wrangler, the vehicle the TANK 300 seems most comparable to, to me, is the new Land Rover Defender, which also runs an IFS and IRS with locking differentials."
you sure???
My friend recently bought a 2011 535xi with 240k miles without asking me or his brother who knows alot about cars.
You're in the right place then
I love Type-O but yeah they're niche.
"You'd think manufacturers would crack down on the dealer markup bullshit, as it kills their sales/marketing angle and pushes the cars upmarket when they do that shit.

I'm worried about the new BRZ/GR-86 and the new Z, great performance cars at great price points....marked up $10K doesn't make them such great performance price points anymore, and then you start comparing them to a lot of other cars instead."

"Watch this for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQcjM6cKxdU

Sure, it's heavily edited and the engine is modified, but that sound is something special you can't replicate in any new Porsche."
Oh damn didn't even think of that. That would be sick.
Rush and Le Mans (1970)
The dedicated Porsche need for speed was pretty good though.
"I think they meant Turbocharger, not scion tC. And at this point it’s a known fact by humanity as a whole, you can’t go fast in a tC."
Great
"Well, once upon a time…"
The first Yellowline race is perhaps one of the best animated scenes ever put to film. And of course the soundtrack. Play it while driving and surprise! You are now breaking the speed limit and somehow you have grown a fantastically voluminous pompadour.
"Agreed, sometimes the Cover hits different based on who's done it.

Trent's version feels more like loosing your friends to drugs.  Cash's cover to age (and probably still a bit of drugs).  Both hit hard and in different ways.

I think I love most of the Tainted Love versions out there, they make you feel like the subject of what is ""tainted""  shifts based on who's performing"

"Depending on what paint you use it might not work out without primer, if you are just using rustoleum or somthing you might get way with it. Clear coat makes it look better but isn't necessary, but its always nice to have an extra layer of protection for heat and oil. It kinda depends on what kind of paint you are using."
I think the entire country of Australia disagrees with me. Shrug.
">Am I supposed to interpret the total lack of updates post-reveal, and the absence of even a firm launch date, as anything else?

You can interpret however you want, but what you said is Tesla is forecasting 0 for 2024. That is not what they're forecasting, it is what YOU are forecasting (and that's fine).

>80k annual is not a number Ford settled on because they’re happy with it - that is the upper limit of what they’re confident they’ll have the batteries for.

That may be the case at the moment, but Ford doubled (tripled?) production estimates once already, I don't understand how you're so confident they won't do so again. They're a massive company and it's years away. I'm confident they'll find a way if there's sufficient demand. Is it so weird that myself (and others) are surprised by a volume of only 80k?"
Well let's slow down a bit.  66% converted to orders but ~80% of those orders were for hard-tops which have been pushed to 2022 at the earliest.  We'll see how many orders are converted to actual fulfillment of sales in a year or two.
"I feel like it's the MK4 Supra being MASSIVELY overhyped, and this new one coming out of the gate with media/influencer polarization because of it's origin and then having to be compared to a car everyone thinks was some 1000hp god's chariot"
"> However, the most Dodge thing possible would be making their electric engine intentionally be louder.

Perhaps attempt to get a whine sort of like the supercharger on their Hellcats."
"Extremely sloppy out of gear, notchy going into gear, and sloppy again once it’s in gear. Shifter also needs regular realignment. The stock clutch is weak and there’s a lot of rev hang."

"Wasn't worth it to private party, the trade in + tax incentive came out to what I'd private sale the car for so it was just easier to trade in. The dealer also gave me slightly more then what I was being quoted at other places."
"Ahh man yes, that was fantastic.  Steve was dropping all sorts of automotive red pills."
The Autobahn already starts at $31.5k and I can't see them lowering the price
"Any Miata engine aside from ND2, they're basically econocar engines (my NA redlined at like 6500...) But the shifter is a treat to row through"
"I've got a Ktuner flashpro on my civic, although its not a TypeR it still revhangs really bad. With the Ktuner you can adjust the parameters to reduce it but be warned, the drivetrain lash in these Hondas is pretty bad. I turned mine back on"

"Indeed, but the 2020 Z4 with the B58 already made identical numbers to the 2021 Supra, so there's some thought, based on reasonable speculation and those numbers, that Toyota either underreported or detuned the B58 the first year."
"I have a 2019, there's definitely a 10 yr extended warranty for the AC. I have the letter from Honda."
"I absolutely have to hand it to them.

I was vocally asking what the hell they were thinking and then a year or so later there I was buying Ford stocks because they had impressed me so much with the electric f-150, Bronco, Maverick, and Mach E."
"I was going to say. The power to weight should’ve have a faster 0-60 but if they’d having to do a shift to 3rd that makes sense. 

Not that it matters. I’m actually pretty stoked it tops out below 60 = shorter gearing = more shifting = more fun."
Honestly the EA888 is one of the best engines on the market today. For a couple of grand you can reliably put down over 300hp.
I think everyone here has listened to those albums.
They keep using the word “small”. That is not small lol.
"You can give them the internet but you can't give them motivation.  If they are unmotivated it's not that they can't it's that they won't.  If they're motivated they might figure it out even if they don't have access to a guide.

There was a guy who was trapped in the desert with a broken down VW bug.  Using only hand tools he trimmed it down to a motorcycle and rode out.  He figured out things like to get around not having a drill he folded sheet metal in half and cut hole with a saw."
That’s good advice but it’s more about the specific car. I’ll probably just end up getting over it but it’s good to hear other opinions

"Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't that what the teggys always were?  I knew my RSX was just a different Civic."
It was overtaken by Slipknot’s red album.
That's a very good point I had forgotten about.
I have driven a CR-Z for 130k miles and it has the best shift feel of any car I have ever owned.

What?
"The V6's, they do 5.8 seconds. The bigger issue is 5-60 though, don't know what the 2022 model does, but last gen was stupidly slow at 7.5 seconds vs Camry's 5.8."
"Frogstomp was a fun as fuck album, listened to the hell out of it when I was their age!"
I haven't seen the Type O reddit but any sub dedicated to a band is like that - even r/grunge is an absolute hellhole for it. Nothing but Cornell/Cobain/Staley bullshit posts that add nothing to anything you could call a discussion

"Eh, I'm none of those professions, you don't need to do those things to own a Type R. I just really don't spend my money on other things except cars, well cars and beer. Thats about it.

Having a high income is all fine and dandy but really all it amounts to is what are you spending your money on that if you stopped would allow you to purchase some more expensive cars? My boss makes like 40k more then me and was flabbergasted I had two Corvettes, he can't afford one. He probably prioritizes other things in life, much like everyone else."

"What would you describe as ""small""? Nobody IRL actually wants a single cab/6' bed model."
"I think the Mercedes g wagon. Since most offroader have similar boxy shapes, I don't get why you would want to put pay 100k more than for a well equipped wrangler.

With that money I would get myself a wrangler and a Grand Cherokee trackhawk and still had money for a miata."
Omg fuck yes I've been so mad they weren't on there!!
"Yep hope so too. According to rumors, the next generation crown might switch to a FWD set up. Along with the trademark of the Crown badge in the US, the next generation Crown might soon make its way to the US to replace the Avalon."
Rally cars in general are heavily engineered vehicles with the average cost being around $400k. They have very short gears which lets them accelerate extremely fast but they don’t have a very high top speed compared to road legal super cars

"Awesome. Were you in the first 250 or was this an additional allocation? I really want the brown so I'm willing to pay the extra money for it and the carbon fiber seats but its pretty great how you can simply just get the stick, pick a colour and just skip every other option as there all aesthetic, cosmetic or don't add much meaning you can just get a legit base model Blackwing for 85k and call it a day."
"Same sort of situation with most new hyped cars tbh. No broncos, no c8s, and almost nothing of any new car at the moment"
If that is the case why ford has two small SUV models? I mean is there a difference between them? And why Ford chose the Ecosport over Puma for US. Is it cheaper?
In my area it's definitely Nissan sedans and Dodge Chargers and Challengers (especially the v6 ones).
"In terms of raw performance, yes. Automatic tech has come a long way and is undoubtedly the way to go if you want to maximise speed. However, it cannot match the tactile feeling of a manual transmission. I would argue that much of the benefits of aforementioned cars would only be enhanced by the presence of a manual transmission, but I do see your point."
"Mechanically,  it's been fine.  7 years and 120k miles with no serious mechanical problems.  The interior has been crap. The driver's side arm rest split open after 30k miles.  I've had trim pieces break and fall off. It's had squeaks and rattles nearly since day one. 

Then there are the recalls.  Steering wheel falling off. Broken door latches (twice). Seat belts not fastening."
"I never found anything in my cars, but my father accidentally left a ""Christmas with Bert and Ernie"" cd in one of his previous cars."
I was told that song is about a blowjob. Listen to the lyrics.
"I disagree, I got 90% of the performance of a CTR for 12k less, that's a no brainer for me. If the car was more expensive and slightly faster I would have just bought a CTR."
"Oh yeah, that's absolutely true. I work in the tech industry but (thankfully) had the option of living in the Midwest. I just started last year, so I kept my student life - same car, same apartment and maybe more expensive beer haha. I plan to hoard money for a while before getting toys. But I still dream shop from time to time. And funnily enough, the Stinger is at the top of my list. That, a Charger Scat Pack and a used GSF. How are you liking it? Have you experienced any of those dealership horror stories that get posted here all the time?"
"Maybe it’s because I watch Doug Demuro, but I haven’t really stopped hearing about the Stinger since it came out. Very different experience than you."
"I feel like a lot of people my age (24) caught the gear-head bug from the series. The first 3 are the only ones I really care for, the 7th does hold a special place in my heart solely because of the end scene"
"Hell yea, that engine is a masterpiece, especially in that application."
"The G is cheap, fairly powerful, and rwd/rwd-based. Both G35 and G37 models are also way more reliable than competing BMWs/Audis, and unlike the IS250/350 have aftermarket mod support. That's what made me buy a G when I was in high school, especially since the ones I could afford were actually in good condition, unlike 335is and IS350s. They seem to have been hit pretty hard by depreciation."
"Not sure what's a more pointless vehicle, this or the diesel CX-5"
"Not required in other countries, not worth the cost to the manufacturer."

"I'd still have a hard time buying any Korean product, whether it be a Samsung fridge or Hyundai car. They focus a lot on making the product look good on the outside but when you actually delve into the mechanical design, or when you have to replace some broken internal component, you quickly realize that under the skin they are actually really cheaply made. That's fine when they still cost significantly less but now prices have gone up quite a bit."
"Yeah you can over rev most auto cars. You can definitely do it in my stock 5.0, and I accidentally did it a few times in my charger as well. In manual modes they design the car to hold gears, and both let me go to about 200rpm past redline before cutting fuel

"A lot of the artists/musicians that we follow we do so because we identify with them - they somehow speak up for us in some small way.

When artists go in a different direction and I no longer feel that we're on the same page I quickly lose interest in them and their music. 

The line is hard to define, I guess it is doing something that is antithetical to my beliefs (mozza is a good example)."

"The i3 was kinda crappy but had acceptable value props for its day...but we are in 2021 and not 2013 anymore and this kind of spec for a brand new car makes the whole company looks bad.

"I understand that. But I have other fun cars I can drive on nice days. So between the extra cash I saved and the fantastic MPGs, I didn't think it was worth it to get the GLI or GTI. 

I don't regret it one bit either. I just got 45 mpg average on a road trip I took over the weekend. 

Priorities change and I may feel different in a couple years though."

"I think one of the N brand's problems is that it's not distinct enough from Hyundai. If I talk to my partner (who is also a car enthusiast but less of a nerd) about the Veloster N, she just laughs and tells me we're not buying a Hyundai. But then on the flip side she likes the Genesis G70 and wouldn't be opposed to one if we needed a sedan of that size. To me, that's also a Hyundai, but for others it's distinct enough. Kia/Hyundai is inherently not that cool in North America, it's associated with economy cars still. Making ""N"" separate, or elevating the brand(s) as a whole would be a major step in the right direction."
"There is a good reason for this. They know the reason they sell cars is price and reliability, not prestige.

It was a pretty big wake up call to the company a few years ago when they fancied up the design language of the lineup sales picked up and then the son of the longtime CEO came along and wanted to update the pricing to compete more directly with rivals and sales plummeted

They are and will be sticking to reasonable performance at a reasonable price and the hell out of head to head showdowns for the foreseeable future because money talks"

He wanted to perform as much live as he was capable of, but others didn't seem to think he was up to it and wanted to have him come out and do ""cameos"" rather than the whole set (like what Judas Priest have been doing with Glenn Tipton). Ward found this proposal disrespectful.

To an extent it also has seemed that Iommi's preference has been for more beat-keeper type drummer rather than someone with the swing and groove of Ward. Allegedly that was one of the contributing factors to Ward leaving Heaven and Hell; Iommi wanted someone to play like the drum machines he had demoed the riffs to. Out goes Ward, in comes Appice.

">  It allowed them to spin the motor to super high RPM without needing a second gear

"""R"" is for ""Regular"" lol :) the rev matching issue is likely a result of compromises that had to be made, it being a decently powered turbo four, with U.S. emissions laws (and California) to pass.

"> I have almost no need for a 300 mile EV because I have a 2nd ICE car. 

Having two cars because one of them has a severe usability limitation kinda sucks though. If I drive to work and a buddy texts me to grab some beers after, I don’t want to have to say “sorry, I can’t because the tools I purchased aren’t up to the task.” I wanna be able to say “sure, no problem!” and not be subject to frustrating shortcomings. Not to mention the cost to keep two vehicles around when, given more range, you’d only need one. At that point, might as well spend the extra $5k and get a 250 mile EV, as it’ll probably be cheaper overall if it means you can ditch the gas car."

The vast majority of high HP FWD cars, for example, are doing 6-6.5 secs in the real world. Do you ever wonder how MT got 5.7 sec for the Camry v6? lol they do like mid 6s with that new 8 speed especially. The VAST majority of 300 hp cars (depending on their weight) are doing 5.8-6.1 sec by just flooring it...sooo 6.3 sec would be keeping up...yet...it still got called out for being slow - couldn't keep up with a lot of cars, hence its rep..

What I do not like about the video you've linked me is that we have no idea how much of a decline there could be on the road. I am not saying that 7.5 sec is the best they can do, again, even Toyota said  7 sec (MT)...

If Toyota is saying 6.1 sec for the manual, I'm expecting 6.3-6.6 sec real world, and maybe every once in a blue moon with a launch having some fun drop it to 5.8-5.9 sec."

Watts shows up 30 minutes later freshly showered, dressed impeccably in a full suit, says ""don't ever call me your drummer again"", and punches Jagger in the face so hard he nearly falls out the hotel window and into the pool below.

Later, Watts asked Richards why he saved Jagger from falling out the window. ""He was wearing my jacket"" he replied."

"As a drummer, today, I can say this man was the greatest. His simplicity  and grooviness turned out to be the very things that made him stood alone, always doing what the song needed, always perfect. For me, the sounding of his drums and his timing, wich came to be HIS timing, indeed, was an spectacle alone, aside from the teamwork, to wich I think he gave that last drop of gold to put it all toguether, as perfectly as the stones could do their magic.

Yesterday, I was listening to the new release of 'Tatoo You' s 'Living in the heart of love', and thinking about them, and hoping that they had a lot more years to live and all...

Truly fucking sad. RIP Charlie Watts."

I won’t be able to think about anything else as I listen to them (like Girlpool, maybe, simply because everyone mentions it). In terms of ideology, I feel like the threshold is when it starts to seep into music. I may listen to an artist that was abusive to their wife (as awful as that sounds) if it’s just music about,,, life? love? etc,, but I definitely will not be comfortable listening to them sing songs about how they’ll have sex with a bunch of women and then toss them aside like a lot of music does.

"One thing nobody mentions with the VQ37->VR30 change is *where* the two engines make their power and torque.

The [VQ37](https://www.automobile-catalog.com/wykres_power_lbft.php) in the Nismo is 350hp at 7400rpm and 276tq at 5200rpm.

The [VR30](https://www.automobile-catalog.com/wykres_power_lbft.php) in the Q50 Red Sport makes 400hp at 6400rpm and 350tq from 1600rpm all the way to 5200rpm.

That is a MASSIVE difference in low end grunt and should help times significantly, something that nobody ever mentions with the Z. The high revving VQ variants were absolute dogs on the low end and needed to be wrung out to make power, similar to the S2000, but not nearly as exacerbated due to having 2 more cylinders and 1.5 more liters of displacement."

According to this list, besides all of the crazy semi-production semi-race cars, you can still see stuff like the Saleen S7, some Koenigsegg's, Ferrari 599, which are all lower hovering around 3 seconds. 

At the end of the day, the reason why manuals are slower a big part of it is gearing. You only have 6, or maybe 7 gears to work with, and generally they are spaced pretty far apart. It's common to see long-legs on a stick car. Where automatic cars are hitting third gear at 55mph because they have 32 million gears. 

I agree about automatics being stat chasers, and generally speaking, manual cars focus more on the glamorous side of driving where outright speed isn't as important - the experiences are. Which I'm totally fine with. I don't think we need 1000 horsepower manual hybrid 4wd crazy missile, honestly I think it's way too much power to reasonably use on any other context than 60-130 racing on the 35 at 2 in the morning. 

I also think that people who thought they hated automatics and loved manuals because automatics were shit simply hadn't driven modern auto cars. A friend of mine is a perfect example. He was a DIE hard manual fan, always had driven manual cars his whole life. Then I took him out in a Dinan m235i with a real modern transmission that wasn't like those slushboxes from the 90's. And it totally changed his mind, he had no idea the transmission could be so responsive and actually add to the driving experience vs. getting in the way. He drives an Audi now. 

It's more of a occasion to drive a manual car for me, a weekend to enjoy the canyons. I want my canyon weekend car to be a manual. But would I ever drive a manual again daily? Probably not. I drove a boat with a automatic and soft suspension daily now. And then I take the Porsche out into the canyons which is manual, 1000lb lighter, loud, uncomfortable, sweaty, breaks your back because the suspension is harsh, and it's glorious. That dichotomy makes you enjoy the manual experience more I think. It's a totally different form of driving vs. just going down the city highway or sitting in bullshit traffic light to light. I don't think I would enjoy driving stick nearly as much if all the roads near me were full of traffic and nothing but straight lines because I'm really fortunate to have some incredible driving roads near where I live. 20 miles of nothing but turns and off-camber corners and 2nd gear hairpins and you will go the full 20 miles and see 3 other cars. And that's one example of really good driving roads. My typical loop is 300 miles long, and 200 of those miles I'm on some amazing winding road where I'm the only person within 2 miles.

"2014 Acura TSX ""Sport"" Wagon, they could've at least gave it AWD a long side it's Manual transmission. But no, it's just a mediocre FWD car."
Great movie
"Should’ve kept the fusion hybrid. Civics, Camries, Accords, Corollas, Altimas, all sell and very well. 

I may be getting a fusion used and save my obs Ranger for the odd truck stuff. The fusions are sexy asf."
"I thought you were done with Hyundai after the dealership screwed you on the Genesis G80 deal where they tried to force you into using their financing.

Is the Kona N available in Europe? The Kona is the 5th best selling vehicle in the small SUV class in Europe, and the best selling non-European car.  126k sold in Europe in 2020."
"Crazy Little Thing Called Love, by Queen. It’s Freddy doing his best Elvis impression, and it’s just pure gold - but feels so different to a lot of the band’s other work, in my opinion…"
"Might not be known for it but if you ever see him play live, he rocks the fuck out on guitar. Like he plays some Hendrix and you're like wait, that's Paul McCartney doing that."
\~2000ish Lexus LS is a beast too
"Richards at one point told Watts to get off the heroin ""until he was older"". And Watts promptly did.

There goes one of the greats, and now I'm worried we'll see Mick go next. (Richards will eventually just reincarnate through sheer alchemical cheek given all the drugs he's metabolized over the decades.)"
Tons of novice drivers bought them. It's a great beginner track car. You can't really base the performance of a car on a random assortment of drivers in a novice track group.
"Dark Horse by Converge. My favorite track from them is their least ""Convergey""."
"Me and all of my metal head friends loved Type-O and no one thought of it as “goth chick shit”. They were in lots of metal magazines and on headbangers ball. 

You’re dead on about their unique and unmistakable sound."
"I admit, I *really* don’t like the front end on these."
Citroen BX 4TC. Looked fabulous but was apparently so awful Citroen offered to buy them back
"Watts will always be a legend. He was never a flashy drummer, but he 's the perfect drummer for the Stones. An inimitable swing and groove."
RIP Charlie
"> The dude drummed for the best rock band of all time

The best rock and roll band of all time played for Charlie."
"Mazda’s current proposition is providing 80% of the luxury of a luxury make at 70% the price. It bridges the gap between a Toyota or Honda and a BMW or Audi.

This is the perfect second car for an urban family that has a CX-5 and love it and are looking for an electric vehicle with the same attributes that they love the CX-5 for, to use as a daily commuter.

A LOT of Mazda customers are also the sort of people who seldom drive their personal vehicle more than a few miles a day and exclusively take rentals when they plan to leave the city (although this might be true of new car buyers in general but Mazda heavily targets the 30-40 yo professional crowd. Mazda has the youngest customers of basically any car brand).

Millennials are Mazda’s target demographic and this car actually has a lot of stuff targeted towards the environment-conscious buyer. A lot of the interior is made of recycled material, for example."
