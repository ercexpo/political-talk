"Totally agree, I don't think it stood much of a chance with it's ambitions. But I don't know what was USSR supposed to do then, peacefully co-exist with capitalist world and don't try to separate itself from it? I highly doubt it would've worked, it wasn't that type of country and it wasn't that kind of situation where it was possible. 

Russian Empire was already very outdated when it collapsed, both in technology, society and culture. Devastation of both world wars and civil war had its effect too. Cold War wasn't on equal footing to begin with, and so USSR got obsessed with 'catching up to and overcoming' capitalist world, and obsession like this tends to have a poor effect in the long run, as well as radicalize population. Although from my perspective post-WW2 population of USSR was nowhere near as radicalized and casually spiteful as modern Russian population, which is an interesting thing.

As for many people defending Stalin, well, from their point of view if you don't defend Stalin that came to power not that long after revolution, then you are probably against everything that was after him as Khruschev wouldn't have existed without him. Then you are against pretty much everything USSR was, therefore conservative 'socialists' will be upset with you. They don't care about ideology and theory too much."

"Don Bradman held these records for the 3000, 4000, 5000 and 6000 run marks for a long time (haven't checked the records in a while). He needed 4 runs in his final ever innings to seal a batting average of 100 - the circumstances of this game were such that his team was going to win it by an innings. But he got bowled for a duck (0) and retired with 6996 runs to his names, 70 dismissals and 52 tests played. His career was interrupted by the Second World War, which he signed up to serve in.

The second highest test batting average ever is around 62. Bradman also held a slew of other records such as centuries in single sessions of play, most runs in a day, scored 499 once I think. He played cricket for over 20 years despite the Second World War interrupting him and was by far the world's best player around the age of 39, which has never been emulated since."
"If they had held him in contempt formally (they didn’t – this was just something that was said in a debate, not an actual motion) then it becomes a bit awkward for us (the British) constitutionally. 

Technically, contempt is an offence that parliament has the judicial power to punish itself; and constitutionally that process is outside of the rest of the legal system. Which means things like diplomatic, sovereign and state immunity don’t apply. So (very theoretically, if he were found to be in contempt by the Commons) he could be arrested and imprisoned for up to two years (or at the next general election, if earlier). (The Lords can imprison for life, but in this example it would be the Commons.)

It’s constitutionally awkward both because that process would be very contrary to international law, and would complicate the Queen’s political neutrality – convention is she invites every (diplomatically recognised) foreign head of state for a state visit exactly once."
"Let’s knock these off one by one shall we.

Yes Hazard underperformed in the CL and that widely acknowledged. He also got widely criticised for that by even the most devout Hazard fan.

He went two yrs without scoring? You mean the two years were he was injured on and off? Those two years?

Lastly comparing Mbappe and Salah to a player like Hazard based purely on G/A is ignorant, because Hazard was a completely different type of player who’s impact on the game couldn’t be measured by stats.(And G/A is the only thing they have over Hazard because by the eye test it was clear who was better)"

"My father was a political refugee, an illegal immigrant who ultimately did the paperwork and became a legal permanent resident.  He ran from Guatemala while civil war was still ravaging it; I'm not clear on details, but he also seemed to have been targeted for things he did back in that country.  He would sometimes talk about how that all had come to be (you may already know the story... the US working to depose a duly elected leader who wanted to return croplands to the people) as well as good things to say about the big name of latino revolutionaries, Che Guevarra.  But when I was a child I didn't understand the economics of the matter.  When presented with ideas of communism, I would think of Che Guevarra, his heroism and how people fondly remembered him.  I had developed a receptiveness to the idea of communism as not being wholly evil, but it was not particularly different in intellectual virtue from being raised to see it as a completely evil system the way most have been.  I may have amounted to a social democrat at best up until last year.  I find human suffering an eyesore.  I don't want to hear about it anymore.  I want a world like those hopeful era sci-fi stories showing humanity united and traveling the stars with all their basic needs already met.  I consider grand problems that stand in the way to realizing that future, and I feel motivated to find solutions to those broad problems.  I am also what could be called a ""compassionate misanthrope"": I want the best for humanity, but continuously observing how difficult humanity makes things for itself and its failures to check or overcome its own dysfunctional natures infuriates me to the point of hatred.  You can imagine a sense of self-hate or unavoidable existential shame plagues me personally with a mindset like this.  I try to avoid it by denying my own humanity.  

It was once I started finding Dr. Richard Wolff in my Youtube recommendations within the past 2-3 years that I began my most significant steps of conversion to socialism, because he clarified the precise distinctions that I never actually took the time to read about: the abolishment of the employer/employee relationship, what ""seizing the means"" actually meant for society, and how the landscape of socialism allowed for multitudes of perspectives to build a society and that even communism has different brands outside of the authoritative and one-party variants.  I felt like I could belong in that camp and that the systemic problems (including tendencies of humanity itself) holding humanity back and threatening it that I had considered before could be adequately addressed by first achieving socialism.  It was the first time I was explicitly thinking with both eyes open to what socialism and communism really were.  Now I'm on board with libertarian socialism and economic overthrow of the corporate model with cooperative models competing with them.  I want to establish a cooperative myself and get to work dismantling capitalism in its capital nation.  Perhaps the rest of the capitalistic world will fall if it does so here first, and, poetically, I could finally exact vengeance for my father's motherland and its people.

The incidents emanating from the pandemic conditions as well as other ongoing patterns (right now my sights are on the video game industry with Ubisoft, Blizzard, Riot Games, etc.) showed me most explicitly that capitalistic rot and the bourgeois class's immense greed and lack of compassion can be assigned a great majority of the blame for many things going wrong, and that socialism can be the solution.  Dr. Richard Wolff, Second Thought, David Pakman (he's emphatically a social democrat rather than a socialist, but still informative), The Rational National, The Majority Report, Ring of Fire, and Jacobin have helped me see things the Marxist way bit by bit until it has come to the point where I learn nothing new about my society and its dismal dystopian state from the senational news pieces they continue to show.  At least the Jacobin and Dr. Wolff go in-depth on the more conceptual and practical elements and provide some useful insights, but the others have basically outlived their use for me with their principle-based news coverage.  They are, however, educating others about the deep and recurring issues affecting our society and why they matter, so I hope their work continues indefinitely.  I just lost patience with the spectacles and verbal shamings of people we cannot even touch right now; I only come up with *lethally* counterproductive ideas when I see rich people or politicians being the problem in news, and the movement would probably not benefit from them."

"lol jesus. you didn't move the goalposts, you fuckin switched the whole damn sport up on me. i don't even really know where to start to unpack this comment, but here goes.  

>The effects a bodily autonomy decision has over others is irrelevant and not included in any definition of the word  

I don't know if english is your second language or you just mistyped or what, but i really don't understand what you're trying to say here. what isn't included in *what* definition of *what* word? 

skipping over that, the entire point of my comment was that you're simplifying the vaccine as ""choosing what to do with their body"", but it's not that simple. Give me an example of somebody making a ""bodily autonomy decision"" that widely effects the people around them like covid does? do you not understand the concept of trying to stop the spread of a virus?  

>Weird that you’re using the exact same logic as the pro life crowd. Using the effect it has on others as a reason to not allow bodily autonomy is not a road you even want to go down  

lol what? first of all, *nobody* said anything about abortion or pro life/pro choice before you did, i don't even understand where that's coming from or how your brain got that wrapped up in here, but explain to me how the logic of that is the same?  

Somebody gets an abortion, they may cause spiritual pain or emotional distress or whatever you want to even call it to somebody who is religious/anti-abortion/whatever. That's a bummer, life goes on for both parties.  

Somebody comes to work unvaccinated, 3 people get covid and die.

By trying to reclaim the word, we defang their attacks. We also don't have to surrender the history and literature of all socialist theory and practice which could be used to educate people, just to avoid offending a few centrists."
Please for the love of god if Rosas gets his ass on our defense and PF starved team mc I will literally kiss him on the lips.
"Defense for forwards in hockey isn’t really comparable to basketball in that it’s not nearly as important. A great offensive player like Gretzky had possession of the puck so often that his way of playing defence was to just have the puck in the offensive zone most of the time.  

Lemieux possibly could have matched Gretzky’s peak if he didn’t get injured and have cancer, but it’s quite unlikely that he matches Gretzky’s career.  

Before Lemieux came back from retirement, he was the NHL’s all time leader in points per game, even ahead of Gretzky.  

It should be noted that Lemieux, after coming out of retirement (a retirement forced upon him by cancer and back injuries), came back at age 35, to a brand new “era” of hockey and immediately became the best player in the league.   

As for current players, Ovechkin has a shot to break Gretzky’s all time goals record. I don’t think it would change too much in people’s eyes, as Ovechkin is already widely viewed as the best goal scorer of all time. Gretzky was always more of a playmaker, he just was so good that he also scored a ton of goals, to the point where he still has the most goals scored of all time."

I am anti rich people, and by rich I mean your wealth compared to the people around you. none of that, everyone is rich compared to people in poor countries. but that feeling of anti rich people is separate from socialism, I just think its a moral failing. If you become rich then imo you have a moral obligation to use it to help others.

If you come into a lot of wealth its perfectly acceptable to use it to live a life free from wage slavery, to live comfortably. but a $3 million dollar home is beyond what is reasonable imo. And I'd lose respect for anyone who instead of using their new found wealth to help others, they use it to buy frivolous shit... like a 3 million dollar house."

"Conversely it was pretty dubious the Canadian government was ever going to approve it, and TC corp made it clear it was abandoning the pipeline. Laying that entirely at Biden's feet is dubious at best.

And as far as I know the US remains a net exporter of oil. It's the overturning of Trump era permits that had not yet gone into production that were overturned by the Biden admin. Existing capacity has not, to my knowledge, been affected.

There are better criticism of the Biden administration than this meme, surely."

"People in the US generally seem to have a feeling that the system isn't working.
They may not know why or how, but they can realize that capitalism is broken.
However the general population does not have a class analysis.
They don't view the world through a dialectical and materialist lens.
So most default to tinfoil hat conspiracy theories and the like.

People bring up the extensive amounts of red scare propaganda and Mccarthyism that the US population was/is subjected to, and this is part of it.

Another important reason that is often pushed aside is that, it is actually in the interests of certain portions of the US population to preserve imperialism.
The US has a labor aristocracy which is pampered by profits from imperialist plunder.
This section of the population, which is quite large, has no real revolutionary potential."

"This is exactly the move. With a 99% survival rate for most age demographics, the only folks that we should be strongly encouraging to seek help are those that fall in the danger categories. I ended up getting covid a month ago, and don't get me wrong it fucking sucked. That being said, as a guy in his early thirties in good cardio health - I am not the target demographic for true danger, and I don't feel it's wise to gamble when I stand to gain so little and lose so much by being a canary in the coalmine for Pfizer. Karen's can scream all they want at me about how I'm killing their grandma, but the whole point is that their grandma is the one that needs the vaccine right now. If it works so well, they should be fine with leaving me tf alone."

One in West Hollywood is going to be a very different house than one is Wyoming. The housing market is unsustainable certainly, but when the fuck do you draw the conclusion that this denotes a material unsustainabilty? Where is the unsustainabilty, what material do we not have enough of and why? What about his house can’t be reproduced to anybody that wants it?"

"If there are *any* players that are a part of their future, its best not to build a foundation of tanking, setting low expectations, and half assing shit. Those arent habits that can be changed like a light switch.

But if not, then tank away, and collect draft assets.

The problem is there are no guarantees from tanking. You cant tell your fanbase that within 3 years we will have a foundation and within 5 years we will contend. Of the many franchises chose or were forced to rebuild, many of them took longer than expected to return to a deep run in the playoffs. Some still havent made that deep run."

"Just like when Fergie left Utd, we found out just how much of a creaking ship Wenger had been holding together almost entirely by himself. Wenger found great success early in his career by using statistics and heuristics to find the best underpriced players. He still had an eye for talent and was a fantastic man manager just unable to compete with the torrents of cash that is in the game now. Mid table teams are able to spend more than Juve or Bayern or Valencia, it's insane. 

With the right recruitment and manager we could be Liverpool, but we're never going to be City or Chelsea or even Utd."

"[Trotsky's position on trade unions is remarkably clear.](https://www.marxist.com/classics-marxism-one-book/the-transitional-program.htm)

>The Bolshevik-Leninist stands in the front-line trenches of all kinds of struggles, even when they involve only the most modest material interests or democratic rights of the working class. He takes active part in mass trade unions for the purpose of strengthening them and raising their spirit of militancy. He fights uncompromisingly against any attempt to subordinate the unions to the bourgeois state and bind the proletariat to “compulsory arbitration” and every other form of police guardianship—not only fascist but also “democratic.” Only on the basis of such work within the trade unions is successful struggle possible against the reformists, including those of the Stalinist bureaucracy. Sectarian attempts to build or preserve small “revolutionary” unions, as a second edition of the party, signify in actuality the renouncing of the struggle for leadership of the working class. It is necessary to establish this firm rule: self-isolation of the capitulationist variety from mass trade unions, which is tantamount to a betrayal of the revolution, is incompatible with membership in the Fourth International.

Certainly, the trade unions are often bureaucratic, reactionary, reformist, and all manner of other words. But that's absolutely no reason not to work in them, or to set up as WSWS suggests, 'rank-and-file committees' at the workplace. Simply put, the trade unions are where you find the masses, particularly the most politically advanced layers. 

So in this instance, the WSWS breaks with the Trotskyist position on trade unions (which is quite a significant break indeed, as Trotsky wrote that such a move makes you *incompatible with membership of the fourth international*).

I'll also quote [this article](https://www.marxist.com/britain-sectarianism-demise-ssp-socialist-party080507.htm).

>The problem is not with the working class, which hasn't moved en masse at this stage, but with the sectarian's lack of confidence in the working class. They talk about the inability of the working class to change the Labour Party, due to the lack of democracy in the party. The sects used this argument in the past about not being able to change the TGWU, the GMB or the EEPTU. But they were proved wrong! When the working class moves no amount of bureaucratic rules will prevent it from changing its organizations. That has been the lesson of history, and it is for Marxists to learn the lessons of history and not repeat its mistakes.

>...Before the working class will move to change society, they will first of all attempt to transform their traditional organizations from top to bottom. This is quite logical as workers draw different conclusions at different times and tend to take the line of least resistance."

"This is the primary reason why I think so many politicians have been more than happy to enact all these mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns.

What's one of the worst things you can be seen doing as a politician? Nothing. Even if doing something will be worse than if you did nothing, the masses will demand that you ""Just do somethinggg!!1!"". Most all of them also need to be re-elected, and/or have a strong desire to stay in the spotlight for various reasons.

So, by enacting these incredibly harmful mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns, it's a great way to, well, cover their own ass. They can virture signal as much as they want, and claim how they just care soooo much about people. If (when) all those things fail to make a difference, they can always shift the blame to the people for not doing well enough. Just look at how the media and social media cover politicians who have kept open vs. ones who shut everything down. Not to mention the obvious power that comes from something like this. ""Never let a good crisis go to waste.""

Then, you have all the politicians in the world who don't need a reason to oppress and fuck over their own people, but certainly love a good excuse to. Especially when you have so many people begging for it.

In addition, the media and all the ""experts"" obviously want this to continue as long as possible. The media is more popular now than ever, between big scary virus and orangemanbad. There's good money and views to be had from keeping people terrified and paranoid. And all the ""experts"" certainly don't want to fade back into irrelevance, sort of like the media.

This ""pandemic"" was over long ago in many countries, US included. It's an absolute joke how people continue to be terrified and paranoid of this virus with a stupidly high survival rate. Essentially everyone has had an opportunity to receive the vaccine if they want it. The role of government in all of this is all but over, and we should all be completely getting back to our lives at this point."

3. He wasn't politically correct and so no need to be so
4. He wasn't into ""appearances"" something the ""intellectual class"" is fixated on.  Notice the number of them that ""appear"" to support ""woke"" causes but actually do not
5. He was into national pride, something the intellectual class hates because raping Americans greatly benefits their pocketbook

Probably a few more reasons."

Evidently not as many people tuned in to watch his games this past year. He's still the most popular player and has by far the largest social media presence and name recognition.
"Depends what you mean by socialism. There are so many different things which have called or call themselves 'socialist' that it becomes meaningless to ask 'what are the problems of *socialism*?'.

For example, the problems of Blanquism, Kropotkinist anarcho-communism, Maoism, and Social Revolutionary terrorism are completely different. The problems of 1930s Anarcho-syndicalist Spain, 2020s socialism 'with Chinese characterics', 1970s Cuban Marxist-Leninism, and 1950s Swedish social democracy are very different. Even the problems of 1920s USSR and 1980s USSR are very different.

If I had to pick one generic thing, I'd say the biggest problem of socialists and socialism as applied in practice throughout history has been lack of participatory democracy. A relatively small group of people deciding that they will control things. This was not new in the USSR in the 20s (for example, in the 19th century you had the Blanquists who were conspiratorial elitist authoritarian revolutionaries, Charles Fourier whose utopian socialism involved an enlightened elite designing and establishing ideal communities for the masses, or many Social Democrats who wanted to lead the masses rather than let the masses lead themselves).

This problem was intensified after the 1917 revolution because Bolshevism gained a worldwide prestige which eventually lead to 'socialism' becoming synonymous with 'Bolshevism' for most socialists. And *particularly* after Stalin replaced Lenin. So 'socialism' came to mean a society where democracy is taken perhaps even less seriously than in a liberal capitalist republic. Lack of democracy is not a problem unique to Leninism though.

(I'm not trying to be sectarian, just answering the question honestly)"

"Arteta is working as more of a transition manager. There’s too many problems with the squad, so a longer rebuild is needed, then depending on his performance they can decide if they will get a new manager.

It’s the same case with Lampard and Ole. Had the ban period been longer for Chelsea, Lampard might have done better. The ambition of Abramovich with the players he brought in meant that Lampard had to compete short term, and he didn’t have the capacity to do so. Ole however had a dream start albeit a terrible drop straight after, but he got lucky with Bruno saving the team, and managed to buy him time to stabilise the squad and his seat."

"The way I see it is that inflation helps the ruling elites hide wage cuts and stagnation. For example; in 1950 in America the minimum wage was 75 cents an hour. You might think that the current minimum wage of $7.25 is a decent increase of over 950%. However if you account for inflation that 75 cent is equivalent to $8.28 today. Which means in reality minimum wage earners have taken a pay cut of over 10% in the last 70 years.

MMT is not so worried about inflation as long as it isn't hyperinflation. It is an idea to increase the spending power of the government without raising taxes (mainly on the rich and corporations) by means of money printing. 

MMT is nothing more than a regressive tax system in my eyes. This is because it keeps corporate tax low and decreases the wages of working people by reducing the buying power of their wages. And in the end there is no practical difference between paying more of your wage into taxes, or inflation causing your wage to be worth less. Either way workers get less for their labor."
"I grew up in Pittsburgh....Gretzky is better. Lemieux great great player worthy status as the no 2, but people overdo the ""what if he hadnt had lymphoma"" to the point of overrating the hypothetical version of healthy Lemieux because it was such an amazing story that he came back and still dominated after it. People also feel bad for him which is a big part of it. Hell even after retiring just came back in 2000 MJ style and started carving up the league. But Gretzky was better"

"It’s mostly fine. We have been competitive in the past (Paul George years vs the heat) so I know they can be good. It gets annoying when the FO doesn’t accept when we are bad and let it happen so we can get a better pick but it’s whatever. There are a few things you have to accept though: we won’t get a star through free agency, Lebron and AD type players are never going to force themselves here unless they have some tie already, and we likely aren’t going to competing for a championship unless everything goes right. When you accept that, you just have to set proper expectations."

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Golden State Warriors. The passing is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the backscreens will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Kerr’s kumbaya outlook, which is deftly woven into his playbook - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Marxist literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these plays, to realize that they’re not just basketball - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike GSW truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the complexity in Kerr’s existencial catchphrase ""Strength in Numbers"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Harry C. Triandis’s “Individualism and Collectivism.” I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Joe Lacob’s genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Warriors tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only. And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."

"He gets paid under contract as a proportion of the ad revenue, which goes up by his viewership. Two things happened, First, Trump and the election caused a massive jump to his viewership, streaming his normal hours but to a 100k audience at the height of the Pres election. Second, covid. Pretty much every major streamer made bank because everyone was at home starved of entertainment, everyone's viewership doubled. Also, the streamers weren't going out anywhere, weren't taking holidays.

  
Basically, he has a normal, non-exploitative, scale-able contract, and history just gave him two years of a massive viewership boost.

  
Edit: Can I just add - putting details of a streamers home, layout, location etc online like this is pretty shitty. Normal every day gaming streamers don't even put a camera anywhere near a window so that the worst of fans and haters can't try work out where they live, to display this guys home, when he's a leftie in that environment and one of the biggest profiles is down-right dangerous."

"In 2-3 years, even if Arteta is gone, the moves would’ve still made sense in hindsight. I don’t think he’s been criticized much for his transfer decisions as they really do make sense given the club’s situation in at this moment.

Most people give him credit for the long-term choices in developing a good young spine and slated him for his tactics. So I don’t doubt him that we would look back and give him credit for at least a few of his signings."

"It was a power vacuum and those will always be filled. The Afghan government wasn't in a spot to hold their own and I get the feeling the US government knows it and has known it. 
President Biden has a unique chance here to call an end to the failure of Wilsonian foreign policy. He could say that the USA has spent ungodly sums of money and thousands of American troop's lives and it's time to accept that we did not achieve our goals despite 20 years and 3 different presidential administrations making some kind of attempt at it. Now is the time to leave this conflict to the history books. 

The people of Afghanistan are going to have to choose their own path. The United States needs to move away from decades of bad foreign policy and Afghanistan can be the catalyst that does it. This could be a win for the left in the USA as a rejection of America's imperial past, framed as a return to commerce and trade vs. intervention and conflict. 
Of course, we know that commerce and trade is really exploitation of others but baby steps."

If he had stayed in OKC and gotten it done there like Giannis did, I think there would be no dispute right now."

but instead, we take ""climate change is no longer reversible"" as evidence of our own demise and, in so doing, we abdicate responsibility for what comes next. no one can ask us to do hard work we don't understand how to do if it's all beyond our capacity to effect. it's a form of seductive nihilism, the sweet and silent call of the void, the siren drawing us ever nearer by promising us certain demise.

">I think a pure ""tankie"" would disagree as a worker-owned cooperative is privately owned and still must compete in a capitalist system.

Interesting. I tend to consider more the structure of the business itself. If it's an employer/employee relationship then it's capitalist, if it's a co-op or other such arrangement so that the workers own or otherwise have control (even if by way of an intermediary bureaucracy) then it's socialist.

A business is simply competing in a market and though it \*does\* matter (e.g. to me) whether the competition operates in a socialist or capitalist way, it really doesn't matter. Like if  you were in a race; you don't really care if the car next to you is making their decisions via a top-down authoritarian structure or democratically."

Teams like Everton, villa, Burnley, PNE, Huddersfield, Wolves, Leeds, Wednesday, Newcastle, Sunderland all have multiple titles in England. But they just won them when there was less money in the game so they don't get to keep their status."

"You’re assuming that people fully understand what liberalism is and or that anyone’s ideals align perfectly with an ideology like liberalism or conservatism or socialism. Most socialists understand that liberalism is a right wing ideology centered around equal treatment under the law, consent of the governed, free markets and limited government. Ideals that most Americans would associate with the “conservative” Republican Party. But most US Democrats and Republicans believe that liberalism is leftism, is the opposite of conservatism (another ideology most don’t understand). 

In the US, a lot of “liberal” Democrats might legitimately support Medicare For All, student and medical debt relief, taxation of the wealthy, etc. That’s not quite socialism, but it’s not quite liberalism either. Probably closest to social democracy. Now, a lot of those same “liberal” Democrats might still blanch at the idea of forcibly nationalizing the airlines or grocery stores or cellphone / broadband carriers, but that doesn’t mean they couldn’t be convinced to join or support workers unions, fight against the police state and the military industrial complex, institute some environmental protections, or other useful things."

"Western mainstream media has given Putin too much credit. That has been mostly good for Putin, since it makes him look stronger than he actually. And in Russia you get points if you look strong. Since Ivan the Terrible, the strongmen have been successful. 

From what I know, Putin's power is based on the fact that he has Russia's most powerful oligarchs backing him. That is also a weakness; what if the oligarchs abandon him? Putin has currently a strong grip on Russia (he can basically get almost anybody killed or exiled) but that might not be the case forever. He can very well be ousted one day. Some new guy can rise from the shadows (just like Putin did) and take the lead.

But you can never really know what is going on in Russia. The country has always been very secretive. And Russian people are very skeptical towards their leaders. They might act like they love Putin, but behind closed doors it's totally different story. They aren't dumb or mindless. It's not like with Trump and his supporters who actually believe almost anything their leader says. And especially young Russians are very anti-Putin."

> and ya Venezuela is a dictatoshship and a third world country

Now they are, yes.  20 years ago, Venezuela was the richest country in Latin America.  Then they decided to try socialism.  The socialists thought it would be a great idea to nationalize industry and bribe the people with the wealth from it.  ...and the industry failed as a result.  The socialists also (wisely for their continuing in power) banned private firearm ownership, and did buybacks and confiscations.  Then they changed the government into what is effectively a dictatorship.  Now the people are starving and they ran out of zoo animals to eat years ago, and only the government has guns.

"The leftist point of view is neutral. 

Simply put, a reactionary foreign power has left Afghanistan and a reactionary domestic force has toppled the foreigner's puppet government. 

The difference is basically aesthetic. 

Bad guys replaced bad guys. This is neither a positive or negative situation, it's just neutral. 

The big positive take away is that it's another signal that the American Empire is crumbling so we can cheer that and laugh at them for their failure. 

But otherwise we simply do what we always do, express concern and show solidarity for the Afghan people, and extend our support, where possible, to any  homegrown communist and anarchist revolutionaries on the ground in Afghanistan, hoping that they'll be able to free their country from reaction once and for all.

"Don’t forget all of the most brilliant professors, scientists, and doctors. But they just brainwash everyone so fuck Em right?"
"New studies get more traction in the press. Sometimes studies miss people the first time around. The scientific approach also looks for reproducible results so the more studies you have saying similar things but done slightly differently the more you confirm the situation from an empirical point of view. The value of that can be debated but it's the kind of thing you need to make some level of headway on the situation. 

&#x200B;

Getting this stuff out in the broader media is also important because not everyone is engaged enough to catch things the first time around. Some people might forget and need to be reminded. 

&#x200B;

Also, situations change over time. So updating the data and showing how bad things still are or how they have gotten worse not better is important too.

&#x200B;

I do agree that having the studies and doing little or nothing to fix the situation makes the data fairly useless. We've known how bad things are in a general sense for decades and our country overall continues to support the genocide, which is horrifying."

I agree with your point on the whole but I don't think Brighton is the best example to use for fans complaining about their owners, in fact Brighton are probably the PL fanbase that are most happy with their owners. Their owner is a boyhood/local fan, got them a new stadium, and has generally been very open to the fans. On the whole their success in recent years has been more ""organic"" than other PL clubs."
People will rag on him for being a product of nepotism which is an actual fair criticism of him but when people bring this up and how it helped him get to where he is he uses it as an example of why capitalism is a terrible system. Its stupid that he is able to make that much money and the fact that someone who is a self proclaimed dumbass can make a killing because of all the luck he was birthed into. Instead of claiming it was all him he admits to this and points to it in fundamental flaws in the system and why it needs to be changed from the ground up. It is very easy to just judge someone based on their income alone but he has been very consistent in his views at least which is a lot more you can say about most other leftist content creators. I disagree with him on how a lot of things should be done but trying to kick people with actual influence of a leftist movement will do a lot more harm than good

"Lol it's not screwing over the franchise if they only get 2 picks instead of 5.  The difference with making a S&T happen and signing a 5 year ""with the understanding they would help trade him in a year"" is it takes ALL of the power away from Beal.  So what if Boston makes another ""bad offer"" again.  The Wizards tell Beal they couldn't milk enough out of the Celtics so he has to stay another year?  The S&T makes it an absolute that he goes where he wants to go.  The Wizards had a chance to trade Beal last offseason for a massive haul.  They can trade him again this season for a good haul.  If they wait until next offseason, they will have almost no leverage and be at the mercy of where Beal wants to play.  And if he wants to play for a team over the cap, I guarantee you the Wizards will help facillitate it because getting something back to let him play for the Celtics is better than screwing themselves, Beal and the Celtics over just so he can sign with San Antonio, Detroit etc.

&#x200B;

Look at the Jimmy Butler S&T again.  The Sixers literally only got Josh Richardson back.  Lowry only netted Precious and a bad Dragic contract.  If the Wizards wanted an actual return for Beal, they should have traded him last year.  

&#x200B;

But why would Boston want to do Smart and 5 firsts this year without a long term guarantee on Beal (he would not do an extension because he could get more with a new contract) when they can do 2 firsts and guarantee Beal for at least 3 years next offseason.  If Beal signs elsewhere next season (anywhere, not just Boston), I guarantee you the Wizards will facillitate a S&T and it will be for much lower than Beal's value.  The point of a S&T isn't to net equal value for Beal, it's so he can play where he wants to play, and the Wizards get a little something back for playing nice.  Like I said, they aren't going to screw themselves, Beal and whoever is signing him just to spite that team."

Prior to Giannis it's generally well established the top PFs in history are Duncan, Dirk, Malone, KG, Chuck.

More rings, fmvps, dpoys and as many MVPs as Malone

As many rings, more finals MVPs, more MVPs and as many dpoys as KG

As many rings, as many finals MVPs, more MVPs and more dpoys than Dirk

Accolades obviously aren't everything, of course. But if you take accolades alone that puts literally just Timmy ahead of Giannis.

As you said, I wouldn't be mad at people ranking Dirk over him, but I'd personally already put Giannis at #3. And that's just at this point in his career."

"I broadly agree. I don't think we need to wait until socialism to transition away from the current animal exploitation systems. A lot could be done before then, as in, a lot of the capacity to transition is there already.

Similarly, you don't need a socialist society to have a Just Transition from fossil fuels to other energy sources.

I think it's important to put it in its environmental context because that informs the appropriate time scales. Since animal agriculture is one of the greatest polluters, both of GHGs and of water sources (as well as destroying the soil), we need to phase out the bulk of it in quite a short time. So the more 'narrow' ethical aim of humans not exploiting other animals unnecessarily overlaps with the 'wider' aim of not collapsing the Earth's biosphere.

For example, I live in a country (Ireland) where 1/3 of emissions are produced by agriculture, which basically means animal agriculture. We can't be waiting generations to comfortably transition, it has to happen soon."

"“Plausible”? No. A minuscule chance, but not anywhere near the degree of “plausible”. He’s simply a terrible manager who compounds his shortcomings by being extremely stubborn to change. Yes the squad has some serious issues, but it’s still good enough to perform far better than they did last season. That’s not even factoring in the possibility of overachieving through good management, something Wenger and even Emery did to a degree. 

And it’s not surprising. He has ZERO management experience prior to getting the Arsenal role. Would people be so enamoured by his “potential” if he was a ugly bold fat Yorkshireman who used to be Big Sam’s assistant but achieved the EXACT same results as Arteta and played they EXACT same football? Clearly not. So it’s beyond obvious that any fanfare around Arteta is not based on his ability as a manager and instead utterly useless superficial characteristics"

I met him a few years ago and he's become a tattoo artist. He kept trying, making mistakes and learning from them. And since I haven't really drawn in ages he's gotten a lot better than me. I had a bit of talent and practice, he worked hard.

If you took away every goal he ever scored, he would still lead the NHL in all-time points just from his assists alone. In fantasy hockey, they had to create two Wayne Gretzkys, one for only goals and one for only assists to make it somewhat more fair, and they would go #1 and #2 in the draft.

While MJ is still viewed as the GOAT of the NBA by most, there is much more of a debate about him vs. Wilt vs. Kobe vs. Lebron, etc while nobody would ever debate anybody other than Gretzky is the GOAT in the NHL"

"the problem is that one of the soviet projects in central asia was to construct distinct national identities for the present-day central asian countries. as arbitrary as the borders are, they actually follow more or less along the cultural lines artificially forged by propaganda during the last century. (to be clear, central asia was multiethnic beforehand as well, but ethnic dynamics only recently became a foundation for nationalism in the region.) 

it's also very hard to undo the legacy of soviet hegemony on a number of levels: many changes to regional ecosystems (industrial production of monocrop cotton, destruction of the aral sea, fallout from nuclear tests etc) are at least semipermanent, while industrialization has driven irrevocable shifts in daily life for central asian populations. it's an unfortunate situation with few ""good"" paths forward; decolonization is unfortunately not a panacea for the permanent legacy of its inverse."

"I think you're conflating social democracy and democratic socialism.

Social democracy does not seek to establish socialism, just a kinder version of capitalism.

Democratic socialism seeks to establish socialism (and thus communism, eventually) through the parliamentary system and reform.

People can argue that democratic socialism inherently devolves into social democracy (and thus capitalism), as you have, but for people new to these ideas (like OP), it's important to differentiate clearly.

Edit: I looked a bit more into the origin of the terms, and it seems that conflating them is not uncommon. That said, I still think it would be generally good for OP to understand some nuance."

"Marx, as a good heir of the young hegelians, was certainly opposed to the essence of religion. But he, along with a lot of other XVIII-XIX century thinkers, failed to understand the way it has become interwoven with social change. 

Just as there are movements built on a relationship between nation, ethnicity, and socialism, religion often forms part of these cultures. For example, the very memeable crucifix Evo Morales gifted to Pope Francis is a direct allusion to “Liberation Theology” socialism, and the ideas of marxist-jesuit revolutionary Luis Camps (that is a real thing). As to why these movements exist, it’s in my opinion because of three reasons: 1) the obvious socialist content in christianism; 2) the widespread adoption of christianism after the european invasions; and 3) the tactical utility of embracing syncretism rather than atheism as a way to galvanize the masses, and simultaneously, to take away power from the reactionary church. 

Whether or not this is “still” marxist is up to debate, but it’s certainly socialist. You probably know that a lot of the direct precursors of Marx, like Saint-Simon or Weitling, were “religious socialists”, and indeed socialism has largely been tied to religion throughout history. Personally, I believe these global south movements to be “marxian”, as they still uphold some of its developments and theory despite adapting them to their material needs — which Marx obviously couldn’t foresee entirely."

The US extracted resources and held a strategically important region for two decades, building hundreds of bases, while carrying out other operations nearby and around the world, and as expected, now that the US is abandoning the project to focus more on others, new violent oppressors are riding in on the wake of that.

The US never cared about bringing peace or “freedom” to Afghanistan, nor about the Taliban or defeating them. They wanted an endless excuse to be there and stay there and the Taliban was a convenient one. They do not care at all that the Taliban is retaking control. The war hawks will use it to say “see? We needed MORE guns, more military funding, more operations” and the libs will only see it as proof that the whole occupation was a wasteful failure, but fail to recognize what I wrote above—this is all according to plan, really.

"> and were (relative to his era) equivalent to KD/Curry GSW.

KD and curry were both mvp level players who were each individually capable of being the best guys on 60+ win teams that could make the finals. in their primes. they both have multiple scoring titles. pippen's best scoring year was 22ppg on above-average efficiency. that's it. you can't have pippen as your #1 guy and make the finals. pippen was a great player, but he was not a true #1 option on any team going deep in the playoffs due to his lack of offense. if jordan and barkley had teamed up in their primes, that would be similar. one guy as the main scoring option with a good 2nd option and some good pieces around him is not a team that's anything like as stacked, even ""relative to their era"", to KD gsw

rodman was a great fit with the bulls but what he was great at was rebounding and defense exclusively, he was not providing a 3rd option on offense like kyrie is for the nets or like klay was for the KD warriors. he was not going off for 40. and they didn't have grant and rodman at the same time. you're conflating different eras"

It’s something that I always felt in my heart of hearts. I worked as a professional cook for almost 20 years. When you experience that kind of work hours and the minuscule pay you start to wonder how much you actually live your craft. Then you start to wonder why there’s a system that exploits as well as capitalism does. How can I work 60-80 hrs a week and still only make 600 on my paycheck? Extremely weird. Even when I was making the most money working I was still 8 am- 1 am 5 days a week making 2k a month. Yes it was nice as a 23 year old cook, but man, that’s still not a lot."

"I wholly agree. I think the term ""Democrats"" gives a false impression of them being the ""left"" in America though.

The thing with Benn is that he was just so charming. Even those who couldn’t disagree with him more still couldn’t find a bad word to say about him and for me that sums him up perfectly.

"I feel like that’s the biggest difference between Werner and Morata in his time with Chelsea. Similar problems with finishing, but Werner just keeps with it and works on the field as though nothing frustrating happened, whereas Morata literally regressed throughout the games because he couldn’t control the mental pressure of his shortcomings on the pitch. Never forget, the man got 2 yellows as a substitute in overtime, the second one being for whining to the ref after a dive. A major disparity between their mental strenght."
"From the article:

> There is no out and out threshold for the number of positive cases which would cause a game to be called off but it is understood a club would need to contact the League to make such a request.

> When Arteta was asked whether he or the club had requested for the game to be called off, he replied: ""What we did is what we had to do, through the club, through the club doctor as well. He explained the situation, how it developed and the risk that we consider.""

It sounds like they didn't even request to move the game, in which case it is on Arsenal. Probably didn't bother as they knew it wasn't enough to get the game postponed anyway."
"If I'm being honestly, quite unerwhelming but we saw glimpses of his talents.

"This seems disingenuous in the use of religion to accomplish an end and control a population. In my opinion a person should never be an end, and I would say--to do such, or use humanity in such a way would be an immoral action. I totally understand it, and the utility but I do not think it has a stable moral foundation. 

I do not know your cultural values or experiences, but there are functional governments with a high compartmentalization of religious values and governmental functioning. It is an accepted fact that religion should not play a role in the government, it's laws,  and likewise the regulation of religious ideas should not be regulated by governmental actors (due to the power contained in religious ideology which you mentioned). 

I think that there are many paths which could be followed but as the OP seems to be hinting at, and if so I agree, establishing a religious fueled version of socialism would have a higher likelihood of turning into a modified theocracy, it would be much better in the long run to have strong socialistic ideology with a possible acceptance of belief in religious thought. I think the opiate of the masses idea is more about the use and enforcement of religious morality. Socialism (again my opinion) is not compatible with nearly any world religion, perhaps certain Native American religions or maybe Buddhism would be the closest I can think of. There are very good lessons to be learned from different religions, but any religion which has an inability to change based on the growth in knowledge should not used as a guide for society. 

Rigidity is what causes organizations to include government to fail. Homogeneity leads to incestuous ideas which build on themselves, which causes love of a cause or ideology over (quality of) life. The prime example is Capitalism in America, or many other empires.  

I agree there is a difference in church and religion, church is a structured institution based on religion and religion is a set of beliefs and values. It just feels unnecessary, not to be extremely insulting, but many practitioners pick and choose which values they choose to follow (based on a limited set of values), so biases are implicit. Religion should be entirely individual and not in establishment of a society."

Yes he is like every politician who promises everything during campaign but delivers little. I feel like you glossed over why I commented only to attack that I am not auto hate on someone who I think did the right thing but wrongly.


This sub is weird, it isn't conservatives in the same light I know them to be my whole life. It's some weird neo stuff that any person who in the outside claims to be conservative would shutter at these comments. But I'm older, so maybe I'm just disconnected that much.

You're argument is because it was months (considerably no time in we spent 20 fucking years) apart that they as a whole just couldn't handle it.

"> Pep ball requires very high talent of players to accomplish

I don't understand how people keep saying this, when there are so many examples to the contrary.

Roberto Martinez, Michael Laudrup and Brendan Rodgers at Swansea.

Quique Setién at Las Palmas.

Roberto De Zerbi at Sassuolo.

Graham Potter at Brighton.

Marcelo Bielsa at Bilbao and Leeds.

Jorge Sampaoli and Julen Lopetegui at Sevilla.

There are a lot of examples of managers successfully implementing the basics of Pep's football at clubs without insane resources or squads stacked with world class players. By that I mean an emphasis on possession, playing out from the back etc. It's like people still think every non big club still plays hoofball, but that's far from true."

"Tbh I don't have much in depth knowledge. Marxism used to be really popular in the South and W.Bengal but over the years there's a lot of internal issues arising and a lot of the parties have disintegrated from the major parties and have formed their own and some of them have been outlawed by the Govt. A lot of the student unions that are in power on university campuses are leftist or left coalitions which is why the Govt. is increasingly privatising education making it really expensive for marginalised people. I wouldn't really call myself a socialist more like an ally because I don't have much theoretical knowledge and a lot of the campus politics revolve around academic discussions so I'm not too into that. An issue I have with socialists in India is that they often don't address the issue of intersectionality in the Indian context. This has led to the alienation of people from marginalised communities but they still form alliances with the left. I still prefer leftists over right wing fascists or the centrists who are basically still right wing. The leftist people I've met on campus have generally been more supportive of marginalised issues. People like me often get labelled as ""Chinese communist party rice bag converts"" (because Christian, and indigenous with east asian features lol) whenever we demand anything that is in our interest. My region of origin is also under heavy monitoring by the Indian army who have done atrocious things to our people to quell independence movements in the past. I think part of the reason I don't want to play a more active role in these socialist movements especially in the capital has to do with fear of being targeted by the right because activists are often jailed for no legitimate legal reasons whenever protests happen, especially activists from marginalised communities. There's also a lot of laws that are from the British era that are disproportionately used against marginalised dissenters. The same laws used against Indian freedom fighters by the British."

"You're kind of leaving out the historical context where he original antifa was specifically associated with the German communist party.

In general, extremist movements have frequently organized under the guise of ""anti-fascism"" and ""anti-communism."" And they have done exactly what you're doing, ""you're either with us, or you literally support communism.""

So yeah, you can be opposed to antifa and opposed to fascism at the same time. And you can recognize that many people in the US who organize/protest under the banner of antifa are violent anarchist dickheads."

Roma wanted like 12m for Xhaka which is too low, and it's only a one year extension. Gotta compromise somewhere, we ain't PSG."

"I take exception from the title all the way through the last word of the article. You said the connection between the party and the location does exist, I called bullshit.

That's like insinuating that the only reason covid spreads in Martha's vineyard is because of Obama's party. Which is fucking ridiculous to say.

It's about 10 trillion times more likely that Martha's vineyard's current situation is caused by the Delta variant spreading across Martha's vineyard., And that Obama's party has little to no direct connection to that. Was it a contributing factor? Sure, probably a tiny bit. But the simple fact is Martha's vineyard is a socialite paradise, rich people live lavish lives and have parties over there. Obama is far from the only inhabitant of it.

In summary, the article is trying to push a connection that it can't possibly make. Actually, no, let me rephrase, the article is trying to claim that the party was the cause.

That is crystal clear."

"""Have these gentlemen ever seen a revolution? A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois? Should we not, on the contrary, reproach it for not having used it freely enough?

Therefore, either one of two things: either the anti-authoritarians don't know what they're talking about, in which case they are creating nothing but confusion; or they do know, and in that case they are betraying the movement of the proletariat. In either case they serve the reaction.""

"Covid is simply not ""bringing the health care system to its knees"".  If that were the case, governments would not have dismantled field hospitals and would not be laying off hundreds of workers at a time.

The *maximum* at any given point during the pandemic was 20% of the beds being taken up by Covid patients.  Far and away, the most common reason to visit the hospital is due to circulatory issues (heart attack, stroke, heart failure, etc.).  The next most common is respiratory (tract infections, pneumonia, COPD).... which are exacerbated by being unhealthy.  If everyone just ate healthier, hospitals would be ghost towns except for childbirth."

That’s more than likely a bold faced lie. If the peace treaty was thrown out there would be fighting with US forces. No fighting has taken place involving US troops because it was a peace deal with the US not the republic of Afghanistan. So our troops pulled out and the Taliban was nipping at our heels the entire time.

The talking heads on tv are very good at the distraction game and feeding people what they should think. 

It’s no secret that during trumps presidency every fucking thing he did was blasted on tv as a “CRISIS” or a “UNPRESIDENTIAL” thing. Meanwhile when Biden farts a flower comes out of his ass and everyone claps.

Which is why I feel that single player games that are more linear but more focused and polished have been the trend in the last 8 years. Naughty Dog games, indie platformers, Persona, Doom, Wolfenstein, even Nintendo games that are sandbox (Mario Odyssey and BoTW) have ignored most of the open world slog and focused on environments that mesh with the gameplay."

"I think there’s a lot of examples showing how bombing has always caused destabilization like in Iran when Trump bombed Qasem Soleimani it caused Iran to vote in a far right leader who will actually build nuclear war heads or how after Obama bombed Libya (on of the most successful nation in Africa at that the time), they now have an open slave market and so many other times how bombing creates destabilization.

I think this is a better way to go about it. Ask them what would they do if their homes got continuously bombed. Your friends and family dying by air strikes from a country over 7000 miles away. All this while your current administration does little to help your current conditions. What do you do? I’d get mad. I don’t want my friends to die from this foreign threat I’ve never met in my entire life. 

This is why people join terrorist organizations. They are angry. This anger will only continue as a result. What the richest countries in the world need to do is set up humanitarian aid programs and improve the living conditions the people. However, this is very unlikely from a country like the US. Instead we have to advocate for reduction and eventually elimination of foreign wars and acts of aggression."

"What’s fucked up about this is that after the war, many of the fascists were imprisonments for a while, until the Italian government released them and began arresting the brave partisans who fought the Mussolini and his fascist brutes for the “crime” of being communists. They literally unleashed the fascists and improsojed those who fought them because of how popular the communists were. Not to mention the us rigging the Italian elections to keep the capitalists in power"

"[**Ulrike Meinhof**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulrike_Meinhof)

Ulrike Marie Meinhof (7 October 1934 – 9 May 1976) was a German left-wing journalist and founding member of the Red Army Faction (RAF) in West Germany, commonly referred to in the press as the ""Baader-Meinhof gang"". She is the reputed author of The Urban Guerilla Concept (1971). The manifesto acknowledges the RAF's ""roots in the history of the student movement""; condemns ""reformism"" as ""a brake on the anti-capitalist struggle""; and invokes Mao Zedong to define ""armed struggle"" as ""the highest form of Marxism-Leninism"".Meinhof, who took part in the RAF's May Offensive in 1972, was arrested in June of that year and spent the rest of her life in custody, largely isolated from outside contact.

[**Red Army Faction**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Faction)

The Red Army Faction (RAF, German: [ɛʁʔaːˈʔɛf] (listen); German: Rote Armee Fraktion, pronounced [ˌʁoː.tə aʁˈmeː fʁakˌt͡si̯oːn] (listen)), also known as the Baader–Meinhof Group or Baader–Meinhof Gang (German: Baader-Meinhof-Gruppe, Baader-Meinhof-Bande, German: [ˈbaːdɐ ˈmaɪ̯nˌhɔf ˈɡʁʊpə] (listen)), was a West German far-left militant organization founded in 1970. Key early figures included Andreas Baader, Ulrike Meinhof, Gudrun Ensslin, and Horst Mahler, among others. The government of the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as most Western media and literature, considered the Red Army Faction to be a terrorist organization.

[**Siegfried Hausner**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegfried_Hausner)

Siegfried Hausner (24 January 1952 – 5 May 1975) was a student member of the German Socialist Patients' Collective who was sentenced to three years imprisonment in 1972 for terrorist related crimes. When he was released in 1974, like many other former members of the SPK, he joined the Red Army Faction.  

[**Andreas Baader**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Baader)

Berndt Andreas Baader (6 May 1943 – 18 October 1977) was one of the first leaders of the West German left-wing militant organization Red Army Faction (RAF), also commonly known as the Baader-Meinhof Group.

"I've got some ideas about teaching people how to problem solve using groups. That seems to me to be the fundamental unit of socialism, no? If people are taught *how* to organise themselves, and can teach others to self organise in turn, then a more just and democratic society can be achieved.
We can't depend on leaders to emerge, or great schools of thought to be disseminated. They're too easy of targets for disruption and sabotage. We need simple , memetic  tools that can be proliferated quickly along social sidechannels.

Capitalists and those who defend them obviously are against changing the capitalist system, and from an academic perspective, there are those who criticize either the marxist labor theory of value or the marxist historical materialism."

"Well first even though I believe Luffy would win I think it would be a high-diff if not extreme-diff. Pre-1010 Luffy could still use Advanced CoA, and the higher level of it. His ACoA attacks such as Red Roc are far higher in attack potency than anything Fujitora has shown so far. Red Roc did meaningful damage to base Kaido, who I expect to be much more durable than Fujitora. We don’t even know for absolute certain that Fujitora has ACoA.
&nbsp;

Fujitora’s Devil Fruit is very strong, but against someone of this level I think it would only be good to slow Luffy down and crowd control him. Luffy has shown he can take a glancing Thunder Bagua to the head without being KO’d. I don’t see how Fujitora does enough damage to take Luffy down.
&nbsp;

Fujitora has shown a high level of CoO, but we don’t know for sure if he has Future Sight or not. Luffy definitely does. CoO is one of Fujitora’s best attributes yet Luffy still matches it."

Sometimes laypeople need to realise that they don't know as much about a subject as a professional in the field.

"The Bucks and Raptors have very similar looks imo. The raptors had 59 wins their championship year and the years before they were 58 and the year AFTER they were 53. Point being they got their championship because they had a really good team(in the east), caught a bunch of breaks from a Kwahi trade/Kwahi game 7 buzzer beater/ to the warriors breaking down in the finals with injuries. 

The bucks had something similar go on. Had 46 wins in a 72 game season(Comparable to a 52 win season), And they won 56 and 60 games the previous years. They had a bunch of breaks as well too from injuries to other teams to KD's toe. 

Is Giannis the BEST player currently? Everyone claims Kwahi was when he won... So some modicum of respect must be given. KD did as much as he could but he didnt win! 

And also lets give respect to the players in the past - Is Giannis comparable to Duncan? Hell no. Just fyi dude won ROY, an championship, and a finals MVP within a calendar year. And he just played ONLY 132 regular season games(playoffs not included) and started EVERY GAME. He's not even on Garnett's level yet(atleast the bucks tried to put a team around Giannis)."

Biden's first move in January should have been quietly getting American civilians out of Afghanistan...either that or immediately postpone any further reduction in our military forces there until after 2021.  The American press is bending over backwards to avoid this conclusion.  The international press is stating it because it's obvious.  It's the pentagon's responsibility to get soldiers out safely but it's nobody but the US president's responsibility to get civilians out safely knowing the timetable he intends to speed up or delay.  Biden was not obligated to do anything Trump announced.

We strongly believe in the benefits of capitalism. And a ***social democracy can co-exist with capitalism!!***  All we ask is that we socialize the basic needs for humans - mainly healthcare. Yes, I understand healthcare companies may lose a lot if that happens, so why not come to some sort of a compromise?

"If he has good options with actual offers on the table he would have left already, it's not like Barca is in a position of denying money for an 18-year-old who is good but not currently a crucial part of the team (who is also not looking to be a part of the team at all). 

He probably wants to leave for free, and hasn't done enough to justify playing him despite that. His alleged demands are basically a 'fuck off I'm not renewing' move."
You mean the formation we played in our CL run?
"Somehow the media seems to be painting the picture that Taliban has become more moderate probably with the notion that they managed to sit at a negotiating table with the US but I have no reason to believe that this is true. The reports coming in from Afghanistan are now showing that they have basically improved their media image this time but are still oppressive especially in the way things are in regions and cities other than Kabul (which still has some foreign media left). 

It is going to be disastrous."
I still don't get how people think Luffy ain't garps real grandson when they so clearly look alike. Even at water seven they had the same facial structure.

"It has everything to do with it, proven and effective vaccines are fine. New one that doesnt even show great promise or effectiveness isn't worth terminating people and forcing on staff. She has already accepted that if she gets fired she gets fired. It's an issue of someone who worked the covid floor for the last year and willingly helped people and saved lives and never even contracted covid the whole time, losing their job because companies want to jump on a band wagon for no practical reason. Flu vaccine, which performs the same thing as the covid vaccine, was never mandatory, thats not even new.

"1) It's an aesthetic but most of it is arbitrary and it looks like the generic good future from Simcity 2013. Why is glass actually more socialist than concrete? Community gardens sound nice but again it's not an entire future so much as a meme. We don't need solarpunk if we need a good vision of the future (I think critiques are more valuable anyway because depicting a future just ends with me saying anarchist versions are dumb and anarchists saying my version is atrocious).

2) Tech needs to be understood by the left as much more than just ""use it for good or use it for bad,"" because it's not just a tool. It's an infrastructure and fabric that is developed over time and molded into something qualitatively different than it would be under a different system, in addition to how it slots directly into capitalist power. The Luddites show how even if something could be used better under socialism is still can be a weapon of capital and sabotage and machine breaking are necessary and good."

"Real question. When one of the vaccines gets FDA approval probably later this year will that be enough to convince you to take it? Vaccine hesitancy is understandable but long term side effects of vaccines are exceedingly rare and we have yet to see statistically significant problems with short term side effects. 

Hospitals that are dealing with covid are now almost exclusively dealing with patients who have not taken the vaccine. They are then forced to administer other treatments that have also had to be approved for emergency use. Is that better?

I think the problem is that there IS already overwhelming evidence and ignoring it is not a great take. Meanwhile there are people that legitimately cannot get the vaccine due to existing health conditions. These people are often the same ones at high risk for covid. 

I think they are saying you are selfish for prioritizing your own fear of the vaccine over the abillity for people who don't actually get a choice to be able to go out and live a normalish life as with so many unvaccinated people out and covid numbers being where they are it is highly unsafe for them whereas if everybody got on board it would let these people have a real freedom to go out and about with their lives without a highly contagious and much more deadly for them disease floating about.

It also could be construed as selfish I suppose when you consider some of these hospital staff who just got through one period of overwhelming work to be followed now by whatever the hell wave we are currently experiencing. 

I am not really on board for shaming people like that. People who choose to not get the vaccine are not doing in to spite the nurses and immune compromised people(at least I hope not lol). They are doing it because they don't feel safe. I think their fear is completely misplaced but I understand why they feel that way. 

 I am, however, not going to pretend like we don't have answers to most of the reason people say they don't want a vaccine. I'm not going to pretend like it's a well  informed choice to refuse the vaccine. It is a misinformed choice."

If I made this much money espousing socialist views I’d do all I could to pay it forward and help others. There are a lot of people in LA trying to squat vacant homes and invest in shared living spaces. That’d be a priority for me.

He put together a championship team. They just had one of the most mathematically improbable things I’ve ever seen in sports happen
"1. Pippen may not have been MJ but he still took the Bulls to the playoffs and a 55 win record while MJ was gone. He was a superstar and a premium player. Again, relatively to the era of the Bulls, having a guy like Pippen to play with MJ set the Bulls apart greatly.

2. And again, I'm talking relative to era. No other team in the 90's had the type of star power the Bulls did. I'm saying thats equivalent to how much of an advantage GSW had with KD. I'm not saying its a 1 to 1 comparison, it's relative to the field.

3. They never needed a 3rd option on offense. No team had a premium 3rd option. What they needed was a guy who can strictly focus on defense and doing all the dirty work and Rodman fit that mold perfectly. 

4. I'm not saying they had Grant and Rodman at the same time. I'm saying the Bulls during their reign always had a good flow of great role players, Grant and Rodman being a couple examples."

Also, you keep getting shit about white eard betraying his crew, and while I don't think he'd betray a crew in the middle of the fight I could see him leaving and siding with roger before the fight started. He did mention to Oden that he was part of a crew of peoe with strong leaderlike wills (I'm assuming he meant having a strong conquerors haki) and that he didn't go well, so I can see him deciding Rocks was too crazy and dipping out. So I like your take on it. Also dope.

"> it inflates the market to never seen before levels by external cash injection. A little inflation is good but Man City & PSG have broken the market beyond acceptable levels with unsustainable external funding.

Do you have any source for this statement?

EDIT: Okay, since people would rather downvote me than provide proof, here's some proof that transfer spending in recent years is not in any way inflated ""to never seen before levels"". These are the clubs with the highest net spend in every summer since 2000, adjusted for the inflation in revenue of the top 10 richest clubs (according to Deloitte):

Year | Club | Net spend (million €)
---|---|----
2000 | Roma | -383,2
2001 | Milan | -419,8
2002 | Manchester United | -156,0
2003 | Chelsea | -567,1
2004 | Chelsea | -462,7
2005 | Chelsea | -148,9
2006 | Real Madrid | -216,0
2007 | Real Madrid | -168,5
2008 | Manchester City | -281,4
2009 | Real Madrid | -348,6
2010 | Manchester City | -273,3
2011 | Paris Saint-Germain | -183,6
2012 | Paris Saint-Germain | -242,4
2013 | Paris Saint-Germain | -165,3
2014 | Manchester United | -194,8
2015 | Manchester City | -169,1
2016 | Manchester City | -191,9
2017 | Manchester City | -236,2
2018 | Liverpool | -137,2
2019 | Real Madrid | -194,5
2020 | Chelsea | -188,4
2021 (so far) | Manchester United | -125,0

In other words, clubs today are spending less money on transfers than they were in the early 2000s."

I always go to the gym with headphones and dont really pay attention to people, bc i like to focus on myself and in my music. Anyways, recently this 10/10 girl who generally goes the same hours as me came up to me and asked me to spot her squatting. Didn’t really thought about it much. However, yesterday i saw her again and she came up to me and asked me to spot her on the bench. Weird thing is its a pretty packed gym and there are a lot of trainers around, so i dont see any reason why she would ask me. I consider myself good looking and i recently just broke up with my gf. I know its weird to ask for advice in reddit but i feel this sub isn’t as weird as the average reddit user. Should i try to hit her up? Never really saw the gym as a place to flirt but now i dont know.

Also should mention that i have been seeing this girl for a couple of months now and i have never seen her ask for help to another person, thats why she asking me surprised me

Edit: when she has asked me to spot her i have been on a completely different spot doing different exercise"

"It's not ""going to become"" a threat. It is already a threat - it's how the Taliban was able to pull this off in the first place.  This you ass government GAVE the Taliban our equipment, weapons, ammo, uniforms, and intel while abandoning both our citizens and those that assisted our military for 20 YEARS.  They did it without consulting our allies who also have assets and citizens in the region. 

Let me emphasize this - **This administration GAVE terrorists our weapons to kill America's citizens, allies, and supporters in Afghanistan, then turned tail and ran.**"

I don't know what the requirements are for him to make a sacrificial doll, but the ideal way of using his fruit is to make sacrifices of people that the attacker would be hesitant or unwilling to kill in order to get to Hawkins. For example using Kidd as a scapegoat is a great idea and he should do so but maybe with the rest of Kidd's crew or an enemy crew, the main issue is that Hawkins sucks as a fighter :/

But if he can awaken his fruit, boy, I bet he would be impossible to kill if there's anyone alive in his vicinity."

Sure, but I don't see meat consumption as enslavement at all. And by avoiding answering my question directly by providing your own (again, idealist) question, you apparently can't find any contradiction in meat consumption either. So we're back at square one: liberal idealist moralizing. Dressing it up in ""Marxist"" garb doesn't change that.

Again, this is a completely arbitrary, and hence subjective, criterion.

All this about the Rockets owner having beef with Morey or whatever is BS imo. The Sixers were simply asking way too damn much.
"Oblak

Trent Van Dijk Dias Robertson/Shaw

Fabinho/Casemiro Kimmich De Bruyne

Messi Lewy Son/Mane/Neymar

Kane’s unlucky as is Salah because the two best in the world play in them positions. Think you could argue a few other midfielders but Fabinho and Casemiro are the best in that holding role and Kimmich a bit more offensive. De Bruyne is the best 8 in the world. Left wings a sticky one, Neymar isn’t fit much so misses out for me. If he stays fit it’s him quite clearly. Don’t watch Neuer enough so Oblak for me, Alisson would be my third choice. Honestly for right backs no ones involved as much as Trent is and even so no one is actually that good in that position anyway"

"Time will tell.

It's not outlandish. Whatever criticisms we can make of the UN, such a level of world government was probably unthinkable to people even 100 years ago (where the leading proposal was the League of Nations, a kind of inter-imperial world government between Allied nations). Let alone 200, 300 years ago. 

I think the key question is more whether socialism can take root and spread in particular nations and achieve some critical mass. Once you have some critical mass, you just take something like the UN and make it more socialist and democratic, and then go from there. Definitely challenging but pretty imaginable all things considered.

It would be critical to make sure that it didn't just become another Comintern, but would be a genuine federation of states with equal rights, and thoroughly democratic root and branch. That would be a battle in its own right.

"Interesting theory. I would love to see Kid awaken his devil fruit. I don’t think Wano is meant to be his big arc though. Kid intended to take out Shanks. They both have red hair and a scar on the same eye. I think he also lost his left arm fighting the Red Hair pirates which is the same arm Shanks lost saving Luffy. Shanks and Kid have a lot of similarities visually and Kid wanted to take out Shanks out of all the 4 Yonko. I think Kid will really get his moment once Shanks starts playing a bigger role in the story. I guess we will find out once we see more of Kid.

Also, Zoro using fire splitting. That is the first time I heard someone say he’ll use it against King. That needs to happen. It’s too perfect to not to happen. Good call."

And I don’t think it was headed towards them either."

"Seriously? One of the most elite rim protectors and post defenders in the league, great rebounder and finisher, and has progressed into a strong passer from the high post. They run a lot of handoffs and rubs, and he does a good job in that classic Garnett or Horford role where you are reading the defense, looking for cutters or zip passes to the corner for our shooters. He was 6th on the team in terms of assist percentage, only after Smart, Kemba, Tatum, Jaylen and Fournier. 

His per 36 stats were 15 ppg, 13 rpg, 3.4 apg, 1.6 spg and 3.3 bpg, while having some of the best advanced stats on the team. He just needs to stay healthy and show he can play more minutes. I think Nets fans started to appreciate how good he was in that series against them, there were a few games where he impacted the game as much as anyone on the court. He had a positive plus/minus in all the games he played that series despite the fact they lost in 5 and got blown out in most of them."

"It is possible yes. There is a gap in the middle of the standings where it can still be beneficial to lose, but that's still fewer teams that could find tanking beneficial, and it's far from guaranteed they'll actually get anything for it. You can drop yourself out of the playoffs for a #1 pick, but you're just as likely to end up with pick #11. Is it worth it? In theory probably, but you run the risk of really pissing off your fans.

The other thing is tanking is usually more on the office than the team. The players have careers and reputations to play for and usually want to do their best, they just sometimes find ownership has gashed the team of enough quality to win in order to tank.

If a team is an 8 seed, they're a solid and professional basketball team that take the sport seriously, and they have enough quality to win. The office might want the team to lose at that point, but it's too late. They've built a good team of players, and those players are going to want to prove themselves in the playoffs."

We are now finding out that this hospital is just firing nurses for not getting vaccinated. Nurses, I might point out, that stayed and worked every single day during the worst of the pandemic in 2020. And are we going to pretend that this doesn't have anything to do with hospital administrators looking to shave their budgets, maybe hoping for bigger bonuses?

Sounds like a great plan, let's fire perfectly good nurses that were already overworked but at least working, and now load up the remaining nurses with triple the workload, all while crying to the media ""we are drowning in Covid patients"". And you wonder why people are skeptical of ""the science""? It is because of the people in charge, running the show. THEY are the ones not trusted."

Religious exemption. Don’t remember the exact court case but there is case precedent in New York where legitimate personal spiritual and religious beliefs don’t necessarily have to line up exactly with any official religious doctrine in order to abstain from mandated vaccinations. You could probably find it with an internet search. I believe It was 2 Jewish parents suing the NY Public school system over vaccine mandates. There was no official Jewish doctrine preventing vaccines so the school tried to expel their children. The court ruled something along the lines of that it’s not up to the state to interpret religious doctrine and that spiritual beliefs don’t have to line up with religious dogma anyways in order to be legitimate. The state has no place in judging personal religious and spiritual beliefs of any sort.

The Japanese WWII system had no central war leader, and at this same time this was happening the navy general was pleading that the last reserves of the country go to him to continue fighting and giving the navy a 'glorious death.' These overtures of peace were from people in the Japanese government that didn't represent a majority.

"Can't speak much for Shevchenko and Crespo, since they were imports that were new to the league. I feel like Crespo is fondly remembered too.

Torres. The writing was on the wall. Horrendous transfer considering the six months prior.

With all due respect, I can't see how Lukaku fits in with these players. Big money, yes, but he's fit (unlike Torres), used to the league (unlike Shev and Crespo) and loves the club.

No guarantees, but in terms of links to other strikers, I can't see any."

I'm obviously not saying that's the case for every Newcastle player, but there might be a couple of trypanophobes amongst them."

This comment was made two days ago in response to a video where some proud boys were beating anti-fascists in the city of Los Angeles. Furthermore, they were in this post we are in, doubling down on this sentiment disparaging anti-fascists and making excuses for fascists saying that anti-fascist resistance was the very thing ""provoking"" fascists to become right-wing. They deleted these comments instead of being self-critical and all this is fascist apologism."

">But now that I'm a socialist, I feel almost liberated from capitalist brainwashing but also struggle with my newfound realization that the US will likely never become what I hope it will in my lifetime

Capitalism is far more unstable than capitalist propaganda would have us believe. At the moment there is no sign in the U.S. that the capitalist class will not increase the pressure on the U.S. workers to revolutionary levels. The question is rather will this pressure be discharged in a fascist or socialist revolution. However, current developments suggest that US Americans will opt for fascism.

What I mean to say is that the future is more uncertain than ever before, and this uncertainty brings with it as many opportunities for us socialists as it does dangers."

There’s clearly talent there and this really seems like a make or break season for him with Spurs.

"Kawhi Leonard was drafted 15OA with the expectation that he would be a good 3+D in the NBA. Certainly no one expected him to be a top-5 NBA player but everyone expected him to be a defensive stalwart, especially once San Antonio drafted him.

Anyway, that's all to say that I absolutely agree with you on these things being teachable but that's why I'm suggesting it's a lazy comparison. He's got the size of Kawhi and is probably more athletic, but not much else is remotely comparable.

Any one of these prospects could flip a switch and develop BBIQ and defensive acumen. Will they? Likely not. But maybe they will. Even so, I'm not sitting here saying Jalen Johnson or Tre Mann or whoever else is going to be Kawhi Leonard because they have similar height.

I'm sure Kuminga will be a good to great talent. But I feel like the Kawhi comparisons are just sports writers pandering to GSW fans for off-season clicks."

 The first 3 especially are just so excellent, it’s no wonder the shows first 4 season were the best. The next 2 have basically been a part of the same book that still isn’t done (2 battles haven’t happened when they where supposed to). That means that since 2000, there hasn’t even been 1 completed book. People who still think this series can be finished in 2 books, even finishing at all really astound me."

">Yeah housing is a huge problem for Canadians right now. I think it’s hard to say what the most critical problem that the country faces right now, whether it’s clean drinking water, housing, cost of living, or even dealing with covid. All that’s for certain is the Canadian state is not equipped to deal with any of it (or not willing)

My ideas may be a bit unrealistic, but right now my belief is to see controlled nuclear megatrends come to fruition. When that day comes people all over the world will benefit.

"I'm a conservative and I've seen a little of this.  And yeah, we are outnumbered on reddit.  I don't do Twitter, but from clips I've seen on other sites covering stories that looks to be true there also.

But what bothers me most is the way the conservative movement has been hijacked by the conspiracy theorists.  Being a raving lunatic is not conservatism, and I feel far more outnumbered and shouted down by that lunatic fringe than I do by liberal viewpoints.

Vaccines work.  Masks work.  Not wearing a mask and not infecting others isn't some kind of brave stand for freedom, and it isn't a conservative position.  Conservative = slow change.  Vaccines have been required for decades and are safe.  Rejecting the covid vaccine is not a slow change, it's a knee jerk reaction to a disinformation campaign that conservatives should be smart enough to see past.  I'm old enough that when I was a kid if you didn't have your vaccines you weren't allowed in public school.  I don't know if that's still true today, but refusing to get a covid vaccine is just as stupid as refusing to get a measles or diphtheria vaccine.

Before covid you know who were the only people I saw being anti-vacc?  Liberal actresses/singers/Hollywood types who were stupid enough to fall for some idiot ""vaccines cause autism"" conspiracy.  The type with so much money and free time that they had nothing better do do than follow some idiot conspiracy while day drinking their white wine and planning their next affair.  And I laughed at them!  But now those fools are the minority in the anti-vacc crowd, and conservatives are the ones buying in to this idiocy."

I ended dating a woman who is now my wife, and she was down for Bernie through and through (though she didn’t label herself a socialist) and helped me understand that you have to think bigger than just what is “practical” or the status quo. She also opened my eyes to imperialism as she has family still living in South America. 

Fast forward and I became a fan of “the squad,” saw how Dems did Bernie dirty, especially the second time, and started to listen to people like Michael Brooks (who had a YouTube show before he passed away),Cornel West and Richard Wolf, and started to read some Jacobin and CounterPunch and felt like it opened me up to so many ideas (Marxism, understanding neo-liberalism) that felt like an avenue to the type of world I’d want to see.

When I heard the US secretary of state in India a week ago talking about the situation in Afghanistan and how Taliban is trying to take the country over with force and violence and he said that is not the answer. I remembered that they had been in that same country for 20 years killing hundreds of thousands of people. Literally trying to control the country with violence and mind you all of that was illegal under international law. Hypocrisy doesn't explain the American foreign policy and attitude. It's something totally different. It's not even arrogance. It feels like they believe the rest of the world is stupid and will just take their word for it? I can't figure it out.

"I think it was Nagelsmann that said that he isn't special, he just understands that society and people, therefore players, have changed and that mental health is important (I might be adding to the words he actually said, but this is how I interpreted it).

When I read that interview, he had the utmost respect from me. You do not know anybody's true past, and even if it's spotless with no trauma, etc, you can absolutely wake up one day and be hit with something. You can just be a particular way that requires a little more reassurance, a little more care, attention...

I actually feel like you owe me an eyewash for reading this take. Kawhi just got done averaging 30 ppg on 60% true shooting these last playoffs. He's lost 1 playoff series he's played in the last 3 years. Bash him for his durability that's fair but I can easily find 6 or 7 Harden serieses that have been at the same level of play you criticize as the '20 WCSF from Kawhi

Can't wait in 2 years time for a Conference League version of this post
"Both sides of the aisle agreed that we needed to get our of Afghanistan. That is why Trump agreed to leave and Biden did not reverse that decision. The issue everyone has is ***HOW*** we left. The reasons that you point out in favor of us leaving are also agreed on by most people. ***WHY*** we left is perfectly rational and I'm glad Biden decided to go through with leaving. ***HOW*** we left (breaking our agreement, abandoning military installations and equipment, evacuating the military before civilians were evacuated, giving up air control when we need planes to evacuate our people) is why people are blaming Biden. 

All of those decisions are ultimately his to make. He is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. If the intelligence agencies fed him bad information then he should fire them and get better people (he hasn't). If the generals and joint chief of staff did not execute the plan correctly or gave bad advice that led to this disaster then he should fire them and get better people (he hasn't).

> Because it was a different date than discussed under a different admin this means their whole government was to crumble since it was within days

The Afghan government had a nominal force of about 300,000 men. The Taliban a force of about 70,000. They were given over a year to get their shit together and that is if you ignore the fact that the government we supported had been in power since 2004 and should have started preparing to govern the country themselves well before 2020. Shifting the date didn't make the Afghan army weak or unprepared, they did that to themselves through corruption and grift. Shifting the date and breaking the agreement did give the Taliban the green light to stop upholding their end of the deal and start attacking again though.

Maybe if you put down the reefer and try google searching (or clicking on the links I spoonfed you) the agreement, Biden's withdrawal date change, the ANA, etc. you'll be able to make an informed comment and not get ""attacked"" by people correcting you."
"Again, I'm skeptical of upholding idealism and illusion, because of the many stumbling blocks. I believe that it is ultimately counterproductive. 

Let me put it this way: I'm not going to run in an election as a firebrand atheist in a mostly religious country, which even Canada is (and we have a pretty high rate of irreligion). Like, I get that. But I also expect theoretical and political discussion in committed left spaces to understand the role religion plays in orienting people towards a false perception of reality, an idealist one that distracts and numbs.

What I don't understand, in other words, is the resistance to criticism of religion in socialist spaces that identify as following a materialist analysis in the Marxian vein.

Btw, I am not convinced of Christian socialisms' internal consistency, but that is nothing compared to the difficulty one faces in trying to establish widespread Islamic socialism. People have given it a shot, but have routinely faced opposition from clerics, whose correct interpretation of the religious texts and traditions rightly recognizes these socialisms as innovations, and Islam is especially resistant to incorporating innovation. It is a hopeless task. Islam is too legalistic to be open to radical spiritual reform on a mass scale. At most, you can get Sufism, which even when not conservative (and it sometimes is surprisingly conservative) really has no interest in the real world. 

Re the division into eras, I have no interest in following that line. My hope for progress in the Arab world is not that of the Gulf liberals, to become Americans in robes. It is of an Arab world that eschews once and for all the dominance of Islam (and, where it is prominent, Christianity) and embraces a socialist modernity built on a less superstitious approach to reality. This may never, ever happen, but to clarify, that is what my hope is.

Nevertheless, thanks for your engagement, sincerely."
"Oh let’s just forget US’s role in fucking up the entire Middle-East, aiding and arming religious extremists for their own power play only to get fucked, leaving and therefore allowing the rise of said extremists religious groups to power, which then led to Middle-East decimated with war, then US “intervened” to bomb and stop the extremists they helped to create as if to save the world, and those extremists that rose led to terrorism against other western nations. 

US is one of the biggest powers to stir up shit, saying “I didn’t do it!”, then coming in for the “rescue”, taking all the credit for “solving” the very problems they helped to create and making it seem like everyone owes them. Which in return only encourage the fuckers to stir more shit, come to the rescue again, rinse and repeat. 

Not to mention the country that is so much about freedom and greatness is having issues with its own obvious religious and racial extremism in fucking 2021 (you know, a little the same type of extremism similar to the Nazis), a country with human rights violations being rampant in its everyday life, and still pretending like it’s the chosen land of god and everyone should kiss their ass. 

Every country has flaws but US has made denying responsibility or not willing to admit its severe flaws into a fucking art form."

Police work nay be unpleasant at times (most jobs are), but as far as being physically dangerous... it's just not, and most of the danger comes from things that can't be stopped by guns (things like traffic accidents).

We could have avoided a summer of bloodshed (and maybe a disastrous Biden presidency), if we didn't have a group of armed people who respond to situations in constant fear that everyone they see is a potential threat.  Fear does, indeed, make people monsters, and cops are, in fact people.

On a related note:  that's why the left is constantly fear-mongering:  they want people to act out of fear rather than reason."
The problem is also his contract. He is not worth his contract for any team that’s already a contender or feeling comfortable with where they’re at. I think that’s the argument being made when people say he only has value to a handful of teams. Obviously any team would want him if they could pay him half his contract but that’s not a choice. He only has value *at his current contract* for the handful of teams where adding him would be an instant and very significant jump.

There’s some value in what you’re saying sure. However, thats mosty for teams that have to prove they’re not a mess. Its mad overrated & a chip is far more lucrative. Bulls consistently made the playoffs after Rose, being that team and it was just pointless.



I have far more excitement for this season than any of those runs because I at least feel like we’re building something. I guess it depends on if you’re happy with your favorite team basically being the Pacers or you want your team to take more risks to try to be something great. I wouldn’t be happy as a Pacers fan because while they’re consistently solid I want to hopefully celebrate a Chip & I’d take the risks associated with that. I think many would."

I mean, they had wings, lived on top of the red line and they could create fire, there is no more fitting title than ""celestial dragons"" for such beings.

Also the reason King wears that suit could be because of a certain weakness of his race. Maybe they're weak to water and that's why they lived so far above sea level where even rains rarely occurs.

edit: Also maybe there is a parallelism between King's suit and the nobles' suits and air bubbles. Whereas that race did it out of necessity, the nobles are just trying to mimicking them."

"He has, don't confuse my criticism of him as meaning I'm someone who does not watch his streams. I watch him everyday while I work, I actually enjoy his content. 

He is an entertainer that does politically commentary whose brand is built around Socialism, and such, he needs to larp.

He has identified as a Marxist on stream and Marxism IS revolutionary. There is absolutely no such thing as a non-revolutionary Marxist.

Has Hasan unionized a single workplace?

Does he organize and agitate within his community?

Is he an active member of a Communist party?

Does he urge his audience to engage in any of the above?

The answer to all is a resounding no, and that's because he's not a Marxist or any flavour of Socialist for that matter. He's an entertainer and that's all.

If he doesn't want the backlash then all he needs to do is drop the larp, stop pretending like he's a Socialist when he does absolutely nothing to further the interests of the working class."

"Obama's contempt for Biden is as evident as daylight.  While the Democratic establishment was going for the opportunity to ""make history"" with Clinton, if Obama thought Biden was presidential material, he would have used his substantial weight to push for his nomination.  He didn't.  His 2016 endorsement of Biden was merely to defeat Trump, not to support Biden, just like a lot of the electorate."

I usually see works like Socialism Utopian and Scientific (Engels), Critique of the Gotha Program (Marx), Wage Labour and Capital (Marx), Value Price and Profit (Marx), and The State and Revolution (Lenin) recommended for newer people. Wage Labour and Capital and Value Price and Profit are pamphlets that touch on the some of the economic arguments/positions that Marx takes up in capital, but just a lot shorter"

"I can’t help but agree with you. Reddit has become so politicized it’s not even funny. Hell even in video game subs. Used to be apart of /r/apexlegends because apex was actually a BR I could get behind and felt fair to play. Then Respawn announced they were adding a BLM badge to their game. As much as I didn’t like it, it was only fair that a developer is allowed to add what content they want in their game, after all I didn’t have to wear the badge. Yet I saw post after post of people who wanted to wear said BLM badge to “piss off the racists”. I’m just astounded by the pettiness of these soy boys. I jumped to point out that if your going out of your way to piss people off, you’re still being a bully and that post was upvoted for awhile, yet somehow the liberal soyboys heads exploded with them frothing at the mouth. I found that post the next day, well into the negative. And because some of said libtards are so incapable of hearing an opposing opinion, some of them were so nice to even leave pretty nasty DMs for me, some of them even death threats. So much for the party of the tolerant"
"No, what I’m saying is without U.S. funding the Mujahideen would probably fade away and the secular communist government would have gained legitimacy.

One of the reasons Islamic extremism is so common in Afghanistan is becomes it’s been the official ideology of all governments since 1992."

When I was in my early teens I was an AnCap/Right-wing Libertarian, I found r/Anarchism and thought it was going to be an AnCap subreddit. When I saw the phrase ""Anarcho-Communist"" I was completely confused, and then went down a studying rabbit-hole to understand what their beliefs were.

After years of studying and research my ideology shifted and became more refined as I became more well-read on history, theory, economics, etc.

For me, the entire process was entirely out of curiosity to understand a position separate from my own, which then shifted to learning about Socialism in general to understand politics better and refine my own views.

So, no point of being scared, but rather, curious."

"Argument about what killed USSR can be endless and there is hardly a single correct answer, it's always a matter of whom you like or dislike, when blaming one character it's always based on whose moustache/lack of it is the worst and so on. 

I can easily say that it was Stalin that ruined USSR by killing (literally) organized opposition and making political sphere very stale, he also didn't bother making a proper leadership change system. All the leaders after him became leaders in a power struggle, making everything a mess in the process. Progressive reforms and ideas of revolution were extinguished by him too (such as legalization of homosexuality, otherwise never done in Empire-USSR-Federation, it was banned back when Stalin got to power). 

But that single answer won't be correct, because leaders after him kept messing up without fixing core issues, therefore they are to blame too."

"I see 2 holes in this theory:

1. The kingdom were Nami originated from is located in the East Blue. Celestial dragons only live in Mary Geoise, anywhere other than that and they're considered stripped of their title. So that rules out the possibility of her being a celestial blood.

2. If she were also royalty then it wouldn't make sense for her to be left unguarded during the conflict to a point were a random toddler Nojiko happens to pick her up off the streets just like that. Although there is a possibility that her protectors died trying to sneak her out the island. But even so, wouldn't Bellemere recognize her as a princess off the bat since they were sent there to protect the Kingdom from the invaders? It doesn't add up.

If anything Nami might be just a regular citizen in that kingdom and like her people got caught in the chaos. Or maybe they were gifted people who are good at navigation much like how Ohara was gifted at archeology. But unlike Ohara who was despised by the WG, maybe Nami's kingdom was seen as a very valuable asset to them which is why they responded to the distress call.

side note: The invaders who raided Nami's island weren't revolutionary armies, they were just probably pirates or a large number of bandits."

However, I find that learning what socialism is first, rather than heading straight into Marx, is a lot better of a way for you to understand what Marx is really saying: For me anyways.

"Interesting, in that sense I agree with you on AD. Serious disagreement on how Jokic is not 1A though. He carried that broken nuggets team all the way past the (actually healthy) blazers. 

I'd probably put Jimmy butler at 1B, except for last year when he had covid he's put teams entirely on his back during the playoffs.

I would probably drop cp3 at least to 1C if not lower, I think the suns wouldn't have won any of the series they did if their opponents were healthy. Cp3 was an important if overstated cog in a deep team. There were a number of times where you could genuinely put him as the third most important player after ayton and book, which imo pushes him down. I think a big part of why they lost to the bucks was actually not playing Cameron Payne enough to just change the pace they played at, because Milwaukee was just too good a defensive team to allow for that slow paced play. They abused his methodical approach and forced him into a number of uncharacteristic turnovers."

I can tell you that, even in the last half a year since I joined the IMT, we’ve already presented ourselves as a force within the labor movement. In Toronto, we were the ones who organized the May Day rally, as most of the major labor organizations did not bother given the pandemic.

We also organized as part of Ontario Coalition Against Ford, which called on the NDP leadership to organize mass work refusals to win things like paid sick leave. This got a lot of support from the trade unions.

Expanding on that do they know all the ingredients of the food they eat?  Probably not, but they still eat.

I am not suggesting everyone has to get the shot.  I just dont understand the logic of trusting a doctor for one thing but not trusting that same doctor for another.  Better skip that tetanus booster.  Better not get those antibiotics.  Should skip that blood pressure med.
I am suggesting that the people who make the choice to not get the vaccine, should respect the choice of suppliers to refuse service to them.

"No hes right. But this is kinda what engels said about labor aristocracy. She is a progressive socially but economically she isnt really one of advocating for revolutionary ideas. Hakim made a great jab and critique at her and hbomberguy although not really saying their names

https://youtu.be/vmJfF5ogJdA

Its left branded capitalism. Heck ill even go to say hasanabi. A streamer i love. But hes getting to be a millionaire. Reacting to shit doesnt help further the cause. He could help fund socialist parties. IMT(international marxist tendancy) the DSA, CPUSA IWW. Thats a critique on the western left on youtube.

Sure video essays help. But when to get to a point of notoriety it comes to a degree on what are you going to do to stop it. And its nothing. Labor aristocracy makes them comfortable. I believe they still want a socialist system but dont really want to use their power to do something bigger at shaking the system. We need the labor aristocrats(high earning proletariats) to help fund the revolution. Richard wolff created democracy at work and economic update. A socialist media to break capitalist demagogy. He also supports the dsa monetarily, funds gravel institute, and teaches at the new school university. Its a very lefty university. And wolff is rich as fuck.

Theres an interesting book im reading. Its called bread tube serves imperialism. I cant find pdfs so you will have to buy the book.

https://www.amazon.com/BreadTube-Serves-Imperialism-Examining-Psuedo-Socialism/dp/B09798771Q

Essentially ppl like thought slime and vaush or other like him like socialism done left or contrapoints or hbomberguy and such still put a eurocentric view on socialism. Socdem or demsoc views and will side with liberal media to condemn the other marxists. ""Oh im not a stalinist what stalin did was bad. Hugo chavez is a dictator, castro made everyone poor.  Afro socialism was a failure. The black panthers were liberals."" All of things vaush has said.

Natalie is a left wing philosophy and uses that as her perspective which is fine. But if you as a labor aristocracy (rich proletarians like a doctor. Or a twitch streamer) dont contribute to revolution or some meaningful way all your videos are just left branded capitalism. Leftism as a brand. You profit off rhetoric without giving something back. And this is what second thought and hakim try to break. They encoirage organization. And like i said about richard wolff he teaches at the new school. A lefty university. And he funds lefty candidates and the dsa and funds gravel insitutue. Something tangible. Nothing big as vanguards but its something.  These big lefty youtubers could do the same."

So while fan interest isn't just 1:1, he is a the biggest draw for many fans. The authors aren't talking in absolutes where fans are ONLY watching for steph...literally no one claims that.

They are saying that based on the data of this season plus the increase in viewership for the warriors, Steph presents a huge inflate on those number. As the second author points out, even with Lebron the Lakers didn't draw as much local interest as Steph did for the warriors. 

You're taking the conclusion way too literally when all these guys did was point to the data and say that Steph last year was probably the biggest rating draw for the NBA. No one is saying everyone watching a game is solely there for steph...but that he was one of, if not the biggest contributor..."

Salah has been at Liverpool for 4 years now and the lowest amount of goals he's scored in the Prem in a season was 19.

He scores tons of beautiful bangers, he's fast, he's a leader ane he's incredibly technical (despite some weirdos trying to make everyone believe he's actually not - but I guess it's easier to see the flashy stuff)

"The economic argument of Marxism, which is supported by real world evidence, is that capitalists can never stay in their corner of the world, because ownership of capital and other stresses within the economic system like competition, inflation and greed necessitate capitalists to own more and more capital over time.

Capitalists don’t just want or need to make a profit; they are also pressured to GROW those profits CONSTANTLY.

Did this man live in the woods for 30 years? Nearly. But what we see is that no where is really safe; the expansion of capital knows no bounds (another example: imperialism is another form of this expansion).

Another thought; for someone to live off the grid, they must find land that has value and can provide resources to survive; just because someone doesn’t want to make money off of their land doesn’t mean they want land with no value.

If living off the grid still requires land to have value, and capitalists are always trying to increase their value, it only follows suit that they will reach into as many places as they can to take this value for themselves."

"The first thing to understand about the Northites is that they are a cult. Their cult’s leader is a millionaire union busting publisher. A Quintessential capitalist. The next thing to know about the ICFI is that they don’t exist IRL. Their only substantial section is in the US. The SEP are literally only like dozens of people. There’s numerous first hand accounts from former members who detail their experiences with being a cult member. The last thing to understand is that the only thing of substance that they are able to achieve is producing the WSWS. Which is absolute trash. They have been on the wrong side of history so many times that the WSWS is banned from r/socialism & most, if not all, socialist subs.

Part of the problem is that people who don’t have any real world organizing experience cannot tell the difference between a group who has a large online presence but accomplishes nothing IRL, and actually existing socialist organizations. If you were to mention the WSWS in a meeting of socialists, you would be laughed out of the room. It holds no sway over the movement what so ever"
"in theory, that shouldn't matter. as long as the metrics accurately measure the thing they're being used to measure, it wouldn't matter what other observations could also be made.

Having the highest rates of women/men in medicine and science, a trend that still holds up today.

(And yes, I am aware these are issues that mainly benefited hetero and cis women only) 

You cannot divorce the USSR from it's time and hold it to the standards of today, of course it would fail, literally every nation would have failed. You can only compare it to it's contemporaries, compared to which, it excelled in regards to Women's Rights, even with the hypermasculinity.

"It may likely be linked to the ""set-up"" of the scene. Oda is usually very good at making sure the action will follow the ""right-to-left"" / ""to-to-bottom"" format. So the action will usually be ""ready to read"" to follow how time passes in the manga from right to left. Here, if we read this way, we see the slash first, and then Zoro, which can mean that the slash ""occured"" first and that Zoro moved away from the slash. IMO it would have been easier to understand if reversed, but it was probably too difficult to set up."

"however, the communist government was deeply unpopular, and if you truly believe that the USSR had nothing to do with a communist revolution in a country that literally was touching their border, then i’m sorry but i can’t believe that. it is also important to note that the communist government was the one asking for help, and as such they also bear a responsibility for the hundreds of thousands of people who died, many of whom were civilians who were killed going about their everyday lives when they got rocketed by a Hind or had a bomb dropped on them."

"There is literally nothing he could do in his situation that he wouldn’t be criticised in bad faith for by people who hate/envy him. He works in entertainment and so has to live in/around LA for work/family/friends. He wants to own his own home because that’s the only way for secured housing and who wants to live with a landlord who can kick you out without any real notice. LA property prices are insane so these are his choices.
1. he moved to the suburbs and commutes in by car because public transport is bad? “Destroying the climate with his car and suburbs are racist, Adam Ruins Everything said so”
2. Does the above but buys a Tesla? “Oh look at all these clips of you criticising Elon Musk, hypocrite much.”
3. Moves to an affordable neighbourhood? He would actually be taking affordable housing from those that need it and contributing to gentrification 
4. Buys a slightly less luxurious looking house with less space near LA? Still going to be insanely expensive and people will still do bad faith criticisms 
5. Carries on renting? No secure housing, which sucks wherever you live.

For a family of four, it would be harder if they live in one of those big cities especially if they have to pay rent. You wouldn't be able to save some money most of the times. In most other places you will be able to live a decent life."

It had all the symptoms of being a bullshit narrative, and the fact that people now accuse me of being a Putin-sympathizer for espousing these views even though I have never liked Putin shows how basically everyone assumes automatically you are operating with a hidden agenda and cannot be taken at your word."

Wiz aren’t trying to compete in the event Beal leaves so I don’t see the same urgency to get a deal done imo. Especially if it means taking on 30+ million in salaries for players they don’t want. Maybe 2 firsts is a nice sweetener but if it’s Celtics picks then you can assume it will be 24-30
And wipes it with UCL and PL medals
Holy shit I didn't realize it was that late. That's really depressing.
Barca had a history of vilifying players that don’t conform to the Barca line so this isn’t surprising. If they can sacrifice an 18 year old to keep other players in line it will be worth it for them.
"He’s a pirate people in the comments like what a bitch, coward, he’s lame, etc and I’m like he has a power that can connect his life to others kinda makes sense for him to connect his life to his enemy shit that’s what I would do if I had his power."
"And that last part is also exactly why he isnt trading Simmons for Brogdon and a first. One could maybe talk themselves into trading an All-NBA player for Simmons (All-NBA in 2020, DPOY candidate, could maybe fix him etc), but that isnt the case for Brogdon who doesnt have Ben's holes in his game, but he is older and the ceiling of his trade value isnt as high as Ben's.

The issue however is that there probably have been internal clashes between Simmons' camp and Doc, Morey and/or Joel (unless Ben really reacted *this* extremely to a couple post-game comments by Doc and Joel and has zero self-reflection). That fallout kind of makes it impossible to run it back (even if the roster has taken another step with Thybulle, Maxey and Milton all improving and Niang being an upgrade over Scott) which means Morey is dealing with a bad hand this offseason. As a Sixers fan, I really hope his bluff works out soon, as I am pretty scared of the return for Ben if it doesnt work out."

"For grammar and vocab get text books, like the genki textbooks or the situational functional Japanese text books, and for kanji focus on the Jouyou kanji (they're the only kanji taught in schools and the only kanji newspapers can use). I find the kanji tree and kanji study apps are good kanji studying tools. There's also wanikani which I've heard is good for studying kanji as well. Find websites where you can talk to Japanese speakers and ask them questions and talk to them. There are some websites dedicated specifically to this sort of thing. 

Learn about Japanese culture and history because that helps a lot with figuring out idioms and references. Try to watch stuff without subs and translate it as you go, then check the subs for how well you did. Don't just watch anime, watch live action stuff too, because live action tends to have more realistic spoken Japanese. If you can watch stuff that's unscripted that's helpful too. Also try to read and translate written Japanese. The learn Japanese subreddit should have recommended books for different levels of fluency. For that matter, check out the learnJapanese subreddit, they'll have lots of pointers for overcoming plateaus. If you can actually visit Japan at any point, then absolutely do that, because immersion is super helpful for learning a language. If not see if any places in your area have a conversation cafe type setup where language learners can speak directly with native speakers. 

A big thing to consider is when you feel like you're plateauing, before you start trying to figure out what the ""next thing"" to do is, make sure you perfect and practice what you already know, because if you try to move on too quickly because you feel like you've figured it out then that in itself can be what caused that feeling of plateauing because you're not proficient enough to move forward yet.

"MJ was my favorite player growing up, and perhaps favorite of all time. Believe he's arguably the greatest, but two things ... 

1. There are few players that could potentially or would beat him one-on-one. It would not be a piece of cake at all to go through a long list of these players.

2. If I had to pick #1 player overall for a team, historically. I'd actually consider a few centers and more versatile wings over him. It's not slam dunk pick. The Bulls were pretty mediocre for the first part of MJ's career. That alone tells you that you would need other pieces around him."
"Probably cuz he hasnt gone team hopping nor joining a superteam. Then if you compare to pre-heat lebron, i think the only diff is that lebron’s been called the king when he hadnt accomplished anything yet.

"I didn't say they couldn't fire someone for reasonable and legal reasons, so I don't know what your point is.  

They have the right to terminate the employees for any legal reason, but there are some reasons that would cause the employer to have to pay unemployment. If it is legal for the employer to demand they have the vaccine, and the employee refuses, then that is cause for termination, and no unemployment, so the theory goes.  

If it isn't reasonable/legal for the employer to demand vaccination, but still terminates the employee, then the termination is most likely still legal, but they would be on the hook for unemployment."

"**[Military–industrial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military–industrial_complex)** 
 
 >The military–industrial complex (MIC) describes the relationship between a nation's military and the defense industry that supplies it, seen together as a vested interest which influences public policy. A driving factor behind this relationship between the government and defense-minded corporations is that both sides benefit—one side from obtaining war weapons, and the other from being paid to supply them.

"Also worth mentioning; AFCON. Partey and Elneny will likely be going off to represent their nations in the new year. The depth practically halves. And that's before even taking into account coming out the congested winter schedule that usually see a lot of injuries. So if Arsenal couldn't sell Xhaka for enough money to replace him (assuming they have their funds tied up with other transfers in other positions) then it would be a lateral move at best, but most likely a step back just for the sake of placating fans that don't like the guy."

"The Bucks won the series. Giannis scored only 8 less points in KD’s monster game, and took 12 less shots to get his 40. He also had a clutch bucket over KD to tie the game. Idk what you’re looking for, the numbers absolutely did not ignore the context in this case.


If I had to guess I’d say you probably saw KD taking long range shots and went “wow that’s impressive,” then saw Giannis getting to the rim and thought “well that’s what he’s supposed to do”. 


The thing is, we already know KD can hit those, just like we know Giannis can dunk on anyone and everyone for 48 minutes. They’re both impressive, but because KD’s game is more aesthetically pleasing you’re overrating it."

"> I just looked it up, and apparently people fired for cause are also ineligible for unemployment benefits. So even if this is not qualified as quitting, it definitely can be qualified as being fired for-cause. The for-cause rules are very strict but I imagine this would apply.

It would depend on how their contracts were written, I'd imagine. If you're capable of fulfilling every duty laid out by your employment contract, I don't know that they can add new ones (like getting vaccinated) then claim they're firing you for-cause because you fail to meet newly added requirements.

"Don't forget that his crew was legendary too, Rayleigh alone is a pretty massive beast. The Rayleigh we saw at Sabaody hadn't fought in 20 freaking years, and freaking Kizaru himself said ""we aren't prepared to take you here""... A freaking admiral admitted he couldn't apprehend Rayleigh without further preparations, while casually oneshotting Supernovas. 

People like to point to the fact that Rayleigh showed even the slightest bit of exertion (""he was sweating bruh"") but keep forgetting that he was an old as fuck past his prime guy who hadn't fought in 20 years. I am sure he is gonna need to get warmed up at least **while singlehandedly holding off the Marines' highest ranking, most powerful martial force**. In his prime he was probably easily above Admiral level. 

Plus we have not even gotten to see what Scopper Gaban was capable of, he has conspicuously been absent from present events but we know he's alive and out there somewhere, and he was the third guy always shown from Roger's crew but we know nothing about him. 

However we do know that when Oden was charging Roger, both Rayleigh and Scopper stepped up first before Roger stopped them and fought Oden himself."

"If i remember correctly, conqueror's haki is all about having the will/determination to be superior to others. As they say in the anime, ""qualities of a conqueror"" and not necessarily king like status. So stuff relating to him being royalty doesn't make for a good argument. Also what Sanji has been doing so far like: getting former enemies to have a change of heart, inspiring/helping others, wanting to be the best cook, are all just good qualities and don't necessarily count as that of a conqueror. Cuz the thing is the word ""conqueror"" in one piece is more so of a competitive/dominating nature than just pure king-like characteristics imo. If it were the latter then wouldn't all royal blood, leaders, big dreamers have it then or atleast have the potential? And lastly fighting prowess also doesn't make a good argument. Just because someone is strong/will become one of the strongest doesn't mean they are automatically fit for coc. 

So yeah, I don't think Sanji is gonna manifest a coc or even Oda going for that route.

ps: Not a Sanji hater, far from it actually. He is one of my top favorites in One Piece. I'm not also doing this to pit him against Zoro or anything of that sort. I'm just narrating the facts that were shown to us so far and this is what it concluded to."

Even if you’re( not you, anyone/government) inexperienced, even ignorant, even if you literally give 0 shits, even if nobody would notice/say anything to you, even if it was deserved……no exceptions, you can make a bigger “mess/problem” on purpose than accidentally, even if klutzy, even if young/senile, even if developmentally delayed even……

You HAVE to be trying to fuck things up so badly.
“Accidents” can be complex and catastrophic, (airplane crash investigations) but you cannot, it’s absolutely impossible, to accidentally, oopsie daisy destroy economies and centuries of rights/freedoms. 

I refuse to believe things aren’t going exactly according to SOMEONE’S plans, we aren’t “all in this together” and your next door neighbour could be less American than someone who hasn’t even heard of America in some third world village."
"I am deeply convinced that Putin is among the worst politicians in the world by now and I dream of his downfall, along with his oligarchs, enforcers and propagandists. The only ""good"" thing about him is that he isn't as strong as some people think, his regime is rather fragile. As I was born in 2000, ""Putin"" was also the second word I ever said, right after ""Mum"", it's depressing. He was arguably alright first few years (well not really, but maybe could've been worse), but by now he is an uncharismatic old dictator that is obsessed with power and wealth, maybe he always was. Struggling against Putin in a democratic crusade is what's making Russian politics somewhat interesting and makes me feel not that embarassed when I look at active political life in other countries.

CPRF is lame, but as I've said somewhere else under this post there are some good politicians and it's a very big organization that will spearhead opposition in upcoming elections. Liberals are branded extremists and foreign agents (which gives them some strenghts in other fields actually), so many of them won't be able to become legal opposition, despite otherwise being stronger than socialists-communists I guess. Putin's party popularity is around 17% now, so it's a unique chance to deal them damage.

I love non-centralized political systems, if I were a president of Russia, I would've given far more power to local democratically elected structures instead of making them completely obey Moscow. I think it's called ""localism"", but that word isn't commonly used."
"Marxism is about trying to remove that elite layer. Lenin in State and Revolution demands the destruction of the entire state machinery. No police, no standing army, and no bureaucrats. Inevitably, some form of state is required, but that state is to be applied through a series of democratically elected, recallable representatives through workers' councils.

The case of the USSR was an interesting one, and should be studied carefully to avoid repeating its mistakes. As you rightly mention, a bureaucratic layer arose which was similarly hoarding and oppressive. [A good article is this one](https://www.bolshevik.info/russia-how-the-bureaucracy-seized-power-part-one-the-russian-working-class-takes-power.htm) which explains the factors that led to it, and the fight of the left-opposition against it."

Fun fact, once you’ve scanned the item and it’s registered the weight, it’s completely safe to take anything off the scale before continuing.

So for a trolley you scan some items until you fill a bag, and can then take the bag off and continue.

"[The Revolution Will Not Be Televised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF_5xZIstPw) is a documentary made by a film crew that happened to be in Venezuela when the 2002 coup happened and the subsequent revolution to overturn the coup. Especially if the current state of Venezuela seems somewhat confusing, this documentary highlights the revolutionary potential of the movement behind Chavez.

[Greece on the Brink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwJMFsr8tZM) is a well done documentary done by folks in the IMT during the rise of SYRIZA. It goes over the effects of the 2008 financial crisis and the uptick in working class struggle. It is a little outdated since it was made before SYRIZA really took power and betrayed the movement, but many of the people speaking, do essentially paint that as the most likely outcome which shows how much of a handle the filmmakers had on the situation.

I don't have a link, but recently banned from the Labour Party, Ken Loach, did a documentary a couple years ago called ""The Spirit of '45"". This documents the general social elan in the UK following the defeat of the Nazis and the sweeping into power of the Atlee government. It also covers many of the gains won by the Labour Party, like nationalizing the railroads, creating the NHS, building homes, etc."

>Weeks before the first bomb was dropped, on July 13, 1945, Japan had sent a telegram to the Soviet Union expressing its desire to surrender and end the war. The United States had broken Japan’s codes and read the telegram. Truman referred in his diary to “the telegram from J*p Emperor asking for peace.” President Truman had been informed through Swiss and Portuguese channels of Japanese peace overtures as early as three months before Hiroshima. Japan objected only to surrendering unconditionally and giving up its emperor, but the United States insisted on those terms until after the bombs fell, at which point it allowed Japan to keep its emperor. So, the desire to drop the bombs may have lengthened the war. The bombs did not shorten the war.

The US dropped the bombs because they didn't want the USSR to gain influence in Japan."

Garnett was a more dominant defender than Giannis in his era. He might have even had more versatility than Giannis. You don't really know what you're talking about. He was a significantly better playmaker and passer.  Garnetts probably as good as Duncan and absolutely better than Dirk. It's also not exactly fair to compare eras either. The pace is faster now and there's so much more spacing. The game is so perimeter oriented that big men have more mismatches offensively too. Look at the defensive lineups Garnett and Malone had to face VS what Giannis faces. It's tough to compare players. It's best to look at how they dominated relative to their eras. Giannis still doesn't have the longevity of those guys.

"I mean Climate Change really wasn’t discussed that prevalently in most modern households in the West until the early 2000’s. Of course, people in academic and scientific fields before that navigated the subject, but I don’t think there was a significant amount of time or effort put in to combating climate change through socialist / leftist ideology until recent years just because it wasn’t as prevalent of a topic (even though it should have been)."

"> any small amount of virus

I can see you point given the isolations but it's not entirely **any** amount of virus. There are still false negatives due to low viral load and if someone has been vaccinated, comes into contact with the virus and their immune system deals with it well, they can have a negative test.

I get it's not perfect and probably even less so with the delta, but even if it doesn't reduce the number of isolations per positive test, it can still reduce the number of positive tests."

"False consciousness is a type of irrationality, though. 

I have training in analytic philosophy and have a pretty old-fashioned trust in logic and reason and so on. I later did an MA in English (effectively in critical theory and continental philosophy) and spent quite some time trying to insist to those around me that I wasn't ""fundamentally misguided"" in my attachment to analytic philosophy and that the two approaches could learn much from one another. I still think that a great deal of critical theory and continental philosophy is absolute rubbish (as is most Anglo-American philosophy, no doubt, but that tradition lacks the big-name charlatans of the continent), but what I think is good more than withstands a rigorous, critical, and analytical perspective. 

And the debatebros aren't particularly rational. They just like to rant about using facts and logic, but do nothing but appeal to fallacy and personal attack when faced with something they have no answer to."
"This isn't really relevant though. The complaint is that bottom table PL clubs can offer triple what a mid table (I assume) La Liga club can, which is true.

"Do defend Harris, which I hate doing, I don't think this falls on her. She very much falls into the Obama school of foreign policy. Which while not good, is better than Bidens. Biden has indicated for years that he wanted out of Afghanistan come hell or high water and he didn't really care what anyone, including his advisors, generals, or VP had to say. Obama at least had the good sense to keep a presence once he learned about the situation on the ground. She's awful in so many ways but I can't put this on her"

"Should’ve clarified; it’s a product of capitalist brainwashing. Kid didn’t do anything wrong. However, the dude was dealt a horrible, horrible set of cards and literally jumped hurdles to get into Harvard.

Now compare someone who was born to a relatively affluent/upper middle class family who had access to good schools, lived in a cozy neighborhood, and was able to live life comfortably. Works hard academically and does stuff extracurricularly but never has to worry about the sanctity of their life/stuff that’s outside of their control.

The premise is that since we’ve guaranteed “equality of opportunity”, both students theoretically have the same shot at getting into Harvard. Anyone with two brain cells, however, can quickly understand that this assumption carries no weightage of the environmental, social, and biological factors that both individuals are exposed to in order to realize the American Dream/those aspirations. 

The story inherently conveys crucial principles that align with the capitalistic way of thinking; that the “individual” makes rational decisions that then empower their opportunity for success."

"Are the wealthy socialists responsible for capitalism? If they aren't capitalists and exploit workers, then I don't care how much money they have on their bank accounts. And if you are born rich, it is not your choice. Sure everybody with extra money should use it to promote worker's rights.

And there are currently always people more rich and more poor than us. If you live in developed world and are part of the bourgeoisie, you are many times richer than the worker in Bangladesh who makes you shirts. Does that make you a bad socialist? Not in my opinion.

"Not so much scared as apprehensive. I'm from the U.S so I've been pumped with propaganda since birth. Similar to faith no matter how much I understand I can never get it out of the back of my head. 

No matter how much I know about socialist figures I still feel some sort of guilt admiring the writings of people like Lenin or Guevara. These men were portrayed as no better than an ISIS commando since I was a child. Like my old faith, where no matter how obvious the lack of evidence for the gof I believed in, I'll always have that little voice in my head telling me somethings a sin. 

Eventually you learn to stop being afraid of yourself. At that point controlling impulses and breaking dogma becomes a lot easier I think. 

I'm more scared of what may happen if I'm active during the time leftists get too big for the taste of the establishment. My government is not above terror, assassination, torture, kidnapping, threats to family, etc. Not at all. 

And honestly that fear gets me sometimes. But why should I be allowed to feel safe while the victims of my countries imperialism suffer in abject fear? I think I'd rather feel fear than cause it. But that may be easier said than done."

With Ramsdale coming in, I’d imagine they’re banking on him taking the #1 spot from Leno (which will probably after this season). I think they overspent on White but I think once Gabriel and Partey are back from injury, the defense will look a bit more tight. With  Ødegaard back and Bellerin looking to be sold soon, I think they’ve addressed the majority of the issues regarding positions needing to be filled long term. I’m hoping they pan out, but the good news is that they’re young which means if they don’t work out as well as we’d like, they can still be sold for a decent fee rather than running out their contract and getting nothing for them like they have been with the older players that Arsenal have been signing as stop gaps."

"> *I feel like when some people listen and understand what socialism and communism is about they will choose that future.*

When former President Obama was promoting healthcare reform between 2008 - 2010, he faced intense backlash. To me, the most absurd were the 65+ year old Medicare-eligible people who carried signs saying—I'm not exaggerating—""**KEEP THE GOVERNMENT'S HANDS OFF MY MEDICARE!**""

> *This country has been doing everything in it's power to shit on communism every chance it gets.*

This statement is very true. I remember watching a propaganda film in my 1st grade class that compared Russia and the USA. The film contrasted communism and capitalism and was very explicit about how capitalism was superior in every way to communism. From at least 1st grade through 9th grade, I remember being taught every year about the superiority of ""free enterprise"" and ""capitalism.""

> *They claimed straight lies like ""the Nazis were socialist"" and ""Stalin killed more than Hitler"". If your mind was taught for 30, 40, 50+ years that ""communism bad"" it's hard to break the mold.*

I agree.

> *These people aren't lazy, they are just not listening.*

I don't know if I agree or disagree with this statement. At the very least, confronting one's deeply held belief system and accepting that something you've believed all your life was wrong is very difficult to do."
"It's they hypocrisy that is being called out. Also, if you have looked at covid numbers, this is the same case everywhere. The media doesn't provide any context. ER's overwhelmed!!!! We're at 80% capacity what do we do!!!!! Um, ER's always run at near 100% capacity. It's way too wasteful and expensive to create capacity that is never used. Also, when a hospital is ""overwhelmed"" they mean the same thing. It's like 20 people showing up.

Also, I'm not at all interested in hearing about any hospital being overwhelmed 18 months in to 2 weeks to flatten the curve so we can build up resources.

In introducing tiki-taka – originally intended as an insult – to the footballing lexicon, Barça re-wrote the beautiful game’s playbook in their own, perfectly formed 4-3-3 image.](https://www.fourfourtwo.com/gallery/50-best-football-teams-of-all-time)

Here's what David Winner, writer of Brilliant Orange about the development of Dutch football, said when Guardiola stepped down at Barcelona:

>[he learned the game from its Dutch source and took tiki-taka – or ""total football"" – to new levels of perfection. The numinous football Barça played in his time was inspirational, and his sudden loss to football – after successive defeats to Chelsea in the Champions League and bitter rivals Real Madrid in the Spanish league – is a cause for grief.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/29/barcelona-gospel-of-guardiola)

And here's what Richard Williams of the Guardian wrote when he left Barcelona:

>[Modest and dignified, his departure typified a man whose labours helped the club he loves to accumulate millions of admirers around the world. Johan Cruyff laid the foundations and Frank Rijkaard embellished the superstructure, but it was during Guardiola's time that the work reached fruition.](https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/apr/27/pep-guardiola-barcelona-father-figure)

Here's a quote from a Sid Lowe column, just a few months into Guardiola's first season at Barcelona:

>[Suddenly the Catalan press that complained at losing José Mourinho is falling over itself to proclaim the ""Pep Team"" - ""Pep's Dream Boys"" was that little bit too ridiculous, even for them - the greatest thing in the whole wide world ever. Even the Madrid press is impressed, Marca's Miguel Serrano declaring: ""If I was a kid now, my dad would have a hell of a job stopping me supporting Barcelona. The Pep Team's too late because you can change house, job, wife, political party and even your sex, but not your football team, yet when they play it's glorious.""](https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2008/nov/03/barcelona-laligafootball)

So the idea that Barcelona under Guardiola were never called beautiful is just flat out incorrect.

And looking up Klopp's quote in context is very different to how you presented it, he's not saying Barcelona weren't beautiful, he's saying he doesn't like to play beautiful football:

>[Klopp went on to explain that what he likes is ""fighting football, not serenity football; rainy day, heavy pitch, everybody has a dirty face and then they go home and can't play football for the next four weeks. That's what Borussia are all about"", he stated.](https://www.marca.com/2013/11/04/en/football/barcelona/1383581274.html)"
It's only free speech when you agree with conservative talking points. If you disagree it's not free speech anymore.
"Why not? They got a player of Partey's calibre last summer. Having the money and being in London is more than enough to get great players, let alone being a club of Arsenal's overall prestige

They could definitely sign someone like Aouar for example. It doesn't need to be someone from a top club or anything but basically the same types of signings Liverpool made in the first few years under Klopp (Salah, Fabinho etc type of signings)"

"He's in a no-win situation - but make no mistake he was the one who got into it. Trump's plan was to have a light footprint, force the Taliban and Ghani to work together, and to bomb the heck out of the Taliban if they tried to pull a fast one. 

Trump had credibility because he had done stuff like that before, without caring for any niceties (for example when he spaghettied Iran's top general, Soleimani). Not a great situation, but this way the Afghans who were US allies would remain with some safety in Afghanistan. 

Biden did not care about what was happening in the ground, did not react when things went horribly against the plan - like when the Taliban started assassinating pilots a couple of months ago, and worst of all, did a bunch of puzzling, WTF is going on moves such as - bolstering Pakistan (which made it clear which way the war was going to end), abandoning the Bagram air base when tons of US people were still in the country, removing the military before civilians, removing the contractors who were the ones keeping the Afghan Air force's logistics going (which crippled the air force, and the entire way of fighting that the US had taught the Afghan Army). 

So the US has limited leverage right now in controlling events."

">Hearing our fans call Saliba a “weak mentality player” for joining Marseille in Europa over Steve Bruce despite wanting to stay at Arsenal, and then get excited over Odegaard who’s giving up on fighting for his spot despite his competition being 36 year olds in midfield is quite funny to be honest.

No, we don't.

I've literally never seen anyone call Saliba a “weak mentality player” at all, what are you on about?

The criticism of him has been because the club clearly wants him to experience Premier League football, so when the chance to join a Premier League club came and he decided to return to France, he was rightly questioned on it.

No one thinks he has a weak mentality at all."

I agree though, their state definitely has some admirable and novel qualities."

"The 73 win team had a far better version of both Iggy and Draymond(i.e. it was the year Draymond could actually score and shoot threes and Iggy was still a regular contributor and amazing on defense).

Andrew Bogut and Barnes were massive for that team too and Livingston/Barbosa/Speights. That only team, top to bottom, was great in their rotation which is how they won 73 games. It wasn't just a top heavy super team like what you see with Lebron teams, it was a quality all around team."
"The argument that 'people are overworked' ignores the situations which happened in the 19th centuries. That was when literal wars were fought with employers over the 8 hour day.

Certainly, it's harder for US citizens than it is in many other countries, but the BLM protests had *10% of the US population*. Activision-Blizzard, in an industry without a union, recently staged multiple walk-outs and forced the top brass to resign. There was recently a vicious fight in *Amazon* for unionisation, where all of the issues you mentioned are even more pronounced.

Pretending that 'things will stay the same until the population gets more pissed off (an accelerationist perspective) just doesn't line up with reality."

Zyuganov, the leader of KPRF, is a whack, he's either extremely naive, stupid or he's just a grifter, because he keeps talking about Putin's supposed ""left turn"" who then keeps busting independent unions, jailing real leftists, continuing with neoliberal policies and even doing his own small scale imperialism in Donbass, Georgian splinter republics and even Central Africa (there was a private mercenary group involved).

And then there are pro-Putin nazbols like Prilepin lol.

"Only another reason to hand programs and spending to the states.

The states can decide their own income tax rates and what social programs (if any) they want to fund from their own taxpayers. We're incentivizing the absence of work at the federal level, and it's unfair to people who actually contribute.

Let the states who institute poor planning and programs suffer and the ones who promote and incentivize work and less social programs succeed.

Under the current system, the federal government holds everyone hostage to their own desires. Defund them massively. The Federal government only needs to fund the military."

Even if he doesn't work out, Arsenal could easily sell him for 10-15m to a mid-table club and they wouldn't have paid any of the add-ons. But I suspect, at worst, he'll be backup/cup keeper for the next decade at Arsenal unless they end up with a really good young keeper coming coming up through the academy. And 24m spread across a decade is nothing for any PL club, let alone one of the big teams."

Here you can compare his stats to those of other fullbacks and he is more likely than not in the 90th percentile :

"You should probably check my flair and try to understand who you’re talking to before you go and make assumptions. I know that a lot of former party officials became oligarchs under the new capitalist regimes. I’m a libertarian socialist, I generally oppose state and party means to bring about socialism and for this reason. But what you described is literally capitalism lmao. And blaming it on the former communist regime is just a massive cope. It’s been 30 years and the standard of living doesn’t even compare in a lot of these countries to what it was in the USSR. 

Also correct me if I’m wrong but you probably were born well after the fall of communism? So everything you know about it is secondhand from friends or family who were alive then. Also the people in charge now probably want you to blame a system that collapsed 30 years ago rather than be critical of the current status quo, Just a thing you should be aware of, next time you try to act like an authority on the matter to an internet stranger."

Also because the warriors were the better team? Jesus, I fucking hate the culture around basketball so much, as much as I love the sport. The whole ""X player isn't getting hated on ENOUGH"" very rarely comes up in baseball and football, and when it does it's usually with a player that has inescapable media presence. With basketball, constant negativity is just the standard.

">I'm gonna line up 10 random people, but one of those people are capable of killing you without losing a minute's sleep that night. And you're to approach five of them. If I advised you not to exaggerate the dangers, how would you react to that advice?

I would tell you that you're exaggerating the number of people ""capable of killing you without losing a minute's sleep that night' by several orders of magnitude.  That's not even close to being true among *combat soldiers*, much less random people walking down the street.

The fact is that [being a cop is not particularly dangerous](https://advisorsmith.com/data/most-dangerous-jobs/).  In fact, it's not even in the top 20 most dangerous job categories in the US, and even that includes stuff like overweight cops having heart attacks at their desks, and traffic accidents.  ""[Death by bad guy](https://www.dailyinfographic.com/see-the-leading-causes-of-death-for-u-s-police-officers)"" accounts for about 1/3 of the already-small number of cop deaths, and even that assumes that the person who killed the cop was not *himself* justified in doing so.

So the next time your trainer shows you a one-on-a-hundred-million video clip of a cop being gunned down by an 80-year-old dementia patient, remind him that he put you in more danger of dying in a traffic accident by making you drive to the station to watch it.  Simply put, the guy who mows the lawn in front of the police station where you work is more likely to die on the job than you are... and if you only consider deaths caused by acts of violence, *he is three times more likely to die in a lawn care accident than you are to be killed by a bad guy*.

I'm not suggesting that cops dying from violence (although statistically extremely rare) is not tragic.  I want to point out that sending armed people with very loose rules of engagement into fluid situations with a *vastly exaggerated sense of danger* has a cost... and that cost is *also* measured in unnecessary lives lost when cops overreact because their level of fear is wildly disproportionate to the level of danger.

So let me turn your example around:  let's say of the 30-or-so local and county cops in my town on any given day, 10% of them are capable of killing me without losing a minute of sleep.  I'm likely to come into proximity with one or more of them dozens of times over the course of the year as we go about our lives.  Should *I* be worried?  For every ""cop gets ambushed"" video you have I can show you a dozen ""cop overreacts"" videos.  What color line should I put on *my* flag to represent the danger of exposing myself to such danger?"

"I mean I agree with a lot of that, we still live in a liberal capitalist society and will likely stay that way for a bit, but $3Million seems excessive, no? Living in the California hills seems a bit worthy of criticism no? Of course we all want that, but is it not excessive? Does that not at least start to raise questions of where your interests or class goals start to lie? I wouldn’t hold it against him personally, but it makes me question his motives and his personal ideals. Socialism isn’t everyone becomes immediately poor, its to raise the standard of living and break down the socio economic/ class barriers of the hegemonic society we live in. I know that’s what California goes for at this point and $3M is a drop in the bucket, but was there nothing else? It depends on the relations we have to these people. If he’s just a social democrat arguing for co-ops, better wages, and health care fine. But I will not say he’s for inherently proletarian politics if he himself chooses such excess. If $3M is something he could afford he could certainly create means of legitimate organization through such means. How many copies of State and Rev could he distribute freely to an organization? How many tee shirts, food, medical supplies could he help distribute to the homeless for such an amount. He will make more through his streaming regardless, but lets not hold these people up on these pedestals. No gods no masters."

Thanks for that explanation. It does sound positive indeed.
"Let’s answer this:
Aarlong - without Haki, Aarlong is probably one shot now. Let’s give him some Armament Haki so he can do pierce attacks. I believe Luffy dodges his attacks with Observation and then splat.
Enel - enel would suffer the most from Luffys observation Haki. His Rubber fruit auto tanks to its no contest.
Oars- I still believe Oars in straight power battle would be better. But, Luffy can probably take him on in second gear. If he uses Conqueror coated red roc, it’s over then and there. The problem would be the trash units. If conq burst does not take them down there might be some contest there. 
Doffy - doffy would still be a problem. It’s mostly because of his df being able to control others. I’m sure doffy would not directly challenge Luffy 1 on 1. Rather he would plot and get ussop or Nami stuck in his strings and attack Luffy alongside him. He will uses them as defence whilst attacking around and in extreme cases through them. He would still need laws help to get his friends out before taking out doffy.
Katakuri - it’s a tossup. The added strength counts for nothing against him as he will just dodge them. It’ll probably be another round of snakeman attack with a war of attrition. I think Luffy got a bit weaker compared to Katakuri. If he is now coating his punches with coc, he is spending more energy in each attack which I believe Katakuri can still dodge. So, it’s likely that Luffy runs out of gas trying to overdo missed attacks. Best course of action would be to make Katakuri attack has positive beefy trades."

Biden both started this disaster (Biden also voted for the war in Afghanistan for deranged people defending him) and he is going on vacation AGAIN.

If if they done the exact same thing in mid December after the end of fighting season, it would have at least greatly slowed down the Taliban advance.

"People often argue this with the fact that $20 in other countries is worth a lot more than what it does in the US. And to be honest, yes, it does. $20 in the Philippines is P1000.

And I mean comfortable in a very gracious manner. As in, you have stable internet, good housing (studio apartment in a good-enough neighborhood), just enough food, and *maybe -* just *maybe* \- an air conditioner for the godforsaken heat, and no debt. *Very very* minimal luxuries like traveling.

"> I get a refund almost every year like 50% the country does.

that doesn't mean anything.

lets say your tax burden is $1000 for the year, and look at 2 different scenarios

scenario 1: your withholdings totaled to $1500 for the year, and you get a $500 refund

scenario 2: your withholdings totaled to $500 for the year, and you have to pay an extra $500 at tax time.

in both scenarios, your tax paid is **exactly** the same. $1000.

don't confuse refunds with how much tax you paid. that misunderstanding is how so many people thought their taxes went up with the trump tax cuts  despite them actually going down.

a refund is just the amount of money you gave the government above and beyond what you owed. you can get a refund and still have paid tens of thousands of dollars in income tax for the year."

You need to kill all of the Taliban, you need to kill all of the Afghans to do that - first of all, you are the aggressors and have no justice. Secondly, you simply have not established is effective rule and a self-circulating benefit distribution scheme.
Iraq was under Saddam's rule for many years, and the people longed for a better life, but after the complete withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, do you think they would have listened to the US completely (which they did even when they weren't withdrawn, bringing in a lot of investment from other countries).
I'll give you another example, what would it be like if the US military withdrew the troops stationed in Japan, Korea, and Germany?
The biggest problem with Americans is that they can't figure out if they are here to rescue others or are they invaders - you only rescued those who learned English, and what about the Afghans who grew poppies?
Did America come in to spread democracy to Afghanistan? Of course not, Biden has said it was to get Bin Laden - essentially, the US invaded other countries for its own benefit, which is so obvious.

"Mate he's fucking useless for how much he cost. We should've got rid last summer when Inter were interested, and now we're stuck with him.

Been at Spurs 2 years, and still not put together a full 90 minutes of good football. He has his moments - and obviously has the talent - but that means fuck-all when you won't or can't apply it consistently. 

Last season he had about 3/4 good performances - the wins against Southampton and Man Utd, and the 3-1 win against Sheffield United. It's not like he set the world alight. He also notably dropped off in the second half of the season (though the whole team did tbf). 

Still, he was usually gassed after 60 minutes with Jose's low intensity style, it's no wonder he gets dropped under Pochettino, Nuno, and even Mason, all who have had the team playing far more pro-actively than Mourinho. If all 3 have felt he's not fit to even play, and Mourinho actively criticised him on plenty of occasions - then clearly the issue lies with him. There's no point having a midfielder that's going to be a passenger most of the game - especially when they're not *so* productive on the ball that it makes up for it.

  Additionally if there was such a crunch on hospitals why the FUCK would they be firing significant chunks of their staff who up until recently were completely ok to be employed without the vaccine?

Our days were busy with organizing, rallies, fund raising, you name it and we probably did it. Peace marches, protests, international women’s day, Mayday, working locally with unions and students to organize the left. 

I guess I grew-up in the struggle and activism. My parents were active members of the Communist party and worked tirelessly to try and better living conditions of workers in both Canada and Chile.

"For the period we had Odegaard, the results had us as a top 4 team. Before Odegaard and ESR, we were utter shit. Then both of them join up in December, and we're much better. So I suppose technically it's the same starting 11 as the second half of last year, when we were a markedly different team compared to the first half.

Another issue for us last season was that Partey was largely unavailable for more than half of the season. Tierney also missed many matches. This meant that our ""depth"" players like Ceballos, Elneny, and Cedric got a ton of starts. All those minutes going to Lokonga and Tavares improves us quite a bit."

"I think Laporte is better than Kimpembe. Subjective, but just my opinion. You have to remember that Laporte didn’t have a bad season, but was kept out through an injury and then an incredible season from Stones and Dias which saw us keep so many clean sheets in a row. 

Before the start of last season, people were saying he was the best CB in the Prem apart from Van Dijk. He’s still an incredible player, don’t forget that.

Whilst it’s not imperative that teams play with a left footed CB, it can certainly help a bunch when playing certain systems, which is why it definitely can be important. 

I’m probably not going to change your mind because it’s borderline impossible on social media but that’s just my take on it. I think it is downright ludicrous to try and argue that Laporte isn’t a world class CB to be honest."

"Its not really a dislike tbh.

It's more looking back and realising we were too much in love with Poch to realise his major flaws.

The biggest being that he couldn't work without a DoF because his transfers and scouting ability clearly weren't great.

He also sold out our youth which has caused a really promising batch of kids to leave because they didn't see a way to get into the first team etc."
"Just because the election isn't today doesn't mean this information is irrelevant. I guarantee both parties are looking at polls like this and making plans accordingly.

"Fucking hell. Imagine saying Iniesta was a shit player because he didn’t score or assist.

Edit: some of you can’t connect two and two together. Anyone who hasn’t seen Iniesta play will go back, look at his stats and say he’s nothing special. There’s more to football than goals and assists. Every time Hazard gets the ball he’s marked by 2-3 players or fouled. That’s the only way you’ll get the ball off him. I used Iniesta as an example because for both players the stats don’t tell the whole story. Please stop crying “cAnT cOmPaRe A mIdFiElDeR tO aN aTtAcKeR”."
"Some might call it ""the ideology of resentment"". There are ways to pay lip service to leftist ideals that don't do anything to serve the implementation of those ideas, but rather focus entirely on condemning the status quo as irreparably broken. In my experience, this ideology pervades leftist thought in the United States, and I say that as someone who has very much given myself over to the ideology of resentment.

When the majority of ones political involvement focuses on ideological critique of the currently prevailing system without actionable steps to address it, this seems inevitable."

"I survey as a hobby. Make a few bucks and get free stuff.

Been doing it for probably 15 years now. 

In a normal run up to election season as a registered independent I get a small flurry of surveys before the pool dries up until debates. 

In the last 2 months, I have qualified for and completed a record 17 political surveys. And they are increasing in number.

The tone of surveys has changed significantly. Where they normally are really short with mostly multiple choice answers, there are now a lot more open text boxes, a lot more questions about how you voted in the last 4 election cycles (2 used to be the norm).

And over time you can tell by wording the party who paid for it. In the past it would be about a 60/40 split between democrat and republican polling with republican polls asking more about issues, democrat asking more about people/specific candidates, and a small number of outside polls with no spottable party affiliation.

This year, the vast majority of polls are worded like they are out of the democrat/deep state camp, and far more polls are coming from people who are not in the political machine directly.

Heck, I had a toothpaste survey the other day that had a section asking about covid and politics. 

Survey land has become a very interesting place lately, and not just politically. Covid reactions and supply chain shortage reactions are spooking the corporate side, covid and politics are spooking the academic side..."

"One of the reasons our defence looks suspect is because we currently have 5 potential RBs at the club (seeing as how Arteta chose to bring on Tavares at RB last week at Brentford with Bellerin sitting right there on the bench) and NONE of them are good enough to play for us. The club themselves deem none of them good enough. Why this hasn't been addressed is mystery. But hey, a GK and 4th CB we've signed under Arteta is a more pressing concern apparently."

"Yes, I'd say that's true. Any time a single socialist, or even a group of a few hundred has called for revolution, or something like a general strike, nothing really happens. You can only start to lead the working class once you have at least a few thousand members, and a lot of political authority and trust.

Without that leadership, people fall back to their old leaders; trade union leaders and left-reformists. Both of those are unwilling to break with capitalism and hence hold the workers back. The TUC in Britain during the general strike and miners' strikes, the SPD in pre-war Germany, etc."

"I'm from Nicaragua, which I still consider socialist. But back in the 80s we were an ML state. I did not live through it but my parents and family in general did.

The defining feature of that era was the civil war against the Contras or the counter-revolution, a CIA-funded mercenary army. So it was not exactly paradise of course, still, the period is considered a golden age of worker's rights, union power, popular organizations and advancements in social matters and education.

A common line of remembrance was ""We were at war, but we never starved"" in reference to the food rationing system in place to avoid food crises and such.

Honestly I just think the Wizards need to pick a new direction. They tried to compete last season and it didn’t work. Beal isn’t a #1. They are trying to build around him like he is and it’s not gonna work. They’re trying to do a rebuild while also keeping Beal but that’s just not possible. You guys are gonna need to give Beal away at some point. I imagine he doesn’t want to be stuck in the sorta rebuild and the team needs to choose to compete and trade all the young guys for a star that comes on the market or trade Beal for more young guys.

Regardless capitalism is supported by instruments of violence, the police and the military, they will use violence when the capitalist system is genuinely threatened.

Peaceful protests may have won piecemeal reforms, but they’ve never established a workers state. They’re not useless, but it has to be recognised that the capitalist state has to be abolished and that’s hard to imagine as peaceful.

Capitalism was born into this world dripping blood from head to toe. Revolutions in the Netherlands, England, America and France allowed the capitalist system to be born. I tend to agree with the Chartist principle of “peacefully if we may, forcefully if we must”, and it seems to me that force is necessary."

">People are filling political compass tests and taking the results too seriously like they want to be part of a faction in the socialist left.

That's not ""the left"", that's internet liberals whose interest in socialism ends in aesthetics.

Honestly, this whole post is repeatedly conflating internet *leftists* with real organization, as if they were synonymous (they are not) which, if anything, points towards a lack of familiarity with radical organization.

No, there's not a lack of discussion of ideological and practical strategies within organizations, but they are done within organizations, not in twitter or reddit. Similarly, there's no such thing as problems for the sake of *liking or disliking Lenin*, that's an online thing which evolves around leftist aesthetics; ongoing discussions about previous socialist projects (whichever it is) are analysis aimed at learning from past struggles to apply it to present and past struggles, something which no movement can renounce.

>I dont think we need to condemn social democrats ideas just because they are social democrats if those policies help the workers.

Social imperialism is an anti-socialist and anti-worker tendency (unless for you proletarian internationalism ends in the imperial core, of course) which must be threated like what it is, an enemy to emancipation.

And that's precisely why principled discussion is a huge necessity."
"Well, all socialist groups see the problems with capitalism, but they all have their own opinions on how to plan a socialist country if a theoretical revolution were to be successful. We're basically left with only a couple options: 1, have near complete unity until after a revolution were to happen, where it's likely to be a complete shitshow until eventually one socialist ideology prevails, or 2, figure out our differences before a revolution were to happen and go forth with the most popular ideology, or something like that. Obviously things can happen differently, but personally I see those being the most likely options."

"As a theory for economic value, the labor theory for value *is* dated in the field. It's not something you can really use to make any good calculations about prices, the value of the produced goods. Calculating the surplus value isn't very helpful or especially feasible from the perspective of mainstream economics.

But the point of the LBT isn't made for that kind of analysis to begin with. A good counter argument is to point to Marx dual role as both an economist and a founding father of *sociology*. Marx acutely points out that there has to be an invisible *relational* value transfer between two classes. This value, then, isn't strictly economical but cultural - one class gets a bigger size of the cake no matter what. Pierre Bordieu expands om different forms of social capitals in the 70's, from this tradition from Marx inside sociology.

So my idea for a response is to educate people on the intersection between sociology and economy - and that for some (obviously political) reason, the field of economy stopped being interested in other economical theory outside of markets and state politics.

Also, mainstream economy is too fixated on theory and too little on empirical data."

"Inter is just trying to get the best out of a bad situation.

Eriksen almost dying, having to sell Hakimi because of our debt and subsequently Conte leaving when being told about what was going to happen in this transfer window, oh and don't forget Lukaku pushing to leave with a bid that could potentially fix all our debt issues.

There is only so much our management can do.

Inzaghi has a 95% complete team that will most likely fit his needs, we just need 1 more striker (and maybe a backup in the midfield).

Inter fans don't have many expectations about the next season but personally I'm hopeful, regardless of this season I'm sure that in the Winter/next Summer window we'll manage to improve our squad depth and quality.

&#x200B;

So far we got Calhanoglu for free, Dzeko for free (max fee 1.5m if we reach a CL spot iirc), Dumfries for just 12.5m, we finalized the purchase of Darmian for 2.5m and supposedly we are willing to spend 25/30m for either Correa, Thuram or Insigne.

&#x200B;

This season is going to be pretty average if you ask me, Zanetti himself, probably being pressured by both the management and the coach, stated that it is going to be a difficult season for Inter, especially since every single club in Italy except us has greatly improved in team depth and quality in this window.

Getting a CL spot is our goal this season but it would be nice if our team could instantly adapt to Inzaghi to defend the title."

"football players in general tend to be less educated, they are also generally very wealthy and a lot of them are famous and influential too. Combine those things together and it makes the odds of football players getting vaccinated pretty low"
"I have two thoughts on this.

The first is that becoming an effective socialist is a process. The first step of radicalization is realizing that the status quo (global imperialist capitalism) doesn't work. Given how much pro capitalist propaganda there is in the West (and especially the US) this is a big hurdle, in and of itself. But more and more, it's undeniable to basically everyone but boomers that capitalism is a hellish system, and it's ideology is a death cult. Hell, even boomers intuitively understand how fucked everything is, they just misattribute the problems to Qanon/NWO conspiracy shit. 

So it's important to be anticapitalist, and to understand in detail why capitalism is awful and why it needs to be abolished. 

The problem is that you can't stop there. And to that end, the capitalist class seems to accept that most people don't believe in capitalism anymore. They can handle rejecting capitalism. What they can't handle is people finding the solution. And here I mean the only solution that has ever had any degree of success in overthrowing capitalism and putting something new in: Marxism-leninism. 

My second, related thought is that the bourgeois/capitalist class have a strong, vested interest in promoting the idea that communism is/was an abysmal failure, that the USSR was a failure, that China is either capitalist-revisionist or an authoritarian hellhole(or both), etc. So ""acceptable"" leftist thought is channeled into either 

1.anarchism, a noble idea, and the endgame of MLism, but a misguided attempt to abolish the state immediately, leaving the workers revolution vulnerable to capitalist reaction (as has been demonstrated time and again throughout history). 

2. Despair and nihilism with edgy socialist aesthetics (see above)

3. Fruitless electoralism and DSA style ""socialism"" that inevitably gets crushed or coopted into the dictatorship of the bourgeois (see AOC, Bernie, etc ). What's more, this co-opts political energy into a direction that is not only fruitless, but actually ends up supporting capitalism in the end (in the US, through it's DNC stooges). 

There's a reason ML groups, countries, and revolutions are routinely demonized, and if you consider yourself a socialist of any stripe, you should know better than to accept that it's because the State department is telling the truth."
"Speak for yourself.  The bourgeois will often side with the 1% (which is a poor analysis in the first place), so I am definitely at war with the group that is propping up the ruling class."

"Not at all that simple. The afghan army was trainer to conduct war operations identically to the way the US does. The US conducts war operations with a heavy emphasis on a strong air force; things like air drops and rescue, drones strikes, bombing runs. Afghanistan does not have the kind of air force needed to perform these operations, so when the US began training them in our form of war, they were reliant on the back bone of the American air force, which they were told would assist them in conducting these operations. The second they lost the American air force, the afghan army had to fold. They were literally incapable of conducting warfare without it because they were trained, by us, to conduct war in a way that is entirely reliant upon it. Was that a bad decision? In hindsight, probably, but that's not their fault nor was it their decision. We abandoned them. 

I love America, but honestly, if I'm any other nation I'm afraid of allying with us. We're shit allies. We abandon our own constantly, and we do nothing to stand up for our principles across the world.

The taliban are a reactionary clique of slave drivers and rapists, and the Kurds and Kurdistan are a nation, not an ethnicity, not a nationality, a nation and they exist.

It's this kind of chauvinistic political line makes me see some validity why some leftists do use the term 'social-fascism'. How does that  have so many upvotes?"
Can’t make the ole man look bad now can we? Fuck off and show the American people who their leader really is…a profound idiot.
"Saying that he relies on workers at twitch is like saying that a mail carrier relies on the workers who built the roads he walks on. It's technically true, but expecting the individual to compensate for the downfalls of a system is ridiculous."
It just gets more embarrassing by the hour.  Both Joe and Kamala should be forced to resign over this fiasco.  Failures on every level.
Does anyone feel like this is a set up for him to resign?
"So many wrong points.

Ilaix was the highest paid academy player lol, even more than Fati

atm he wants to earn more than Pique, Depay, Fati and Pedri out of the starters.

Laporta wanted him to sign a 3-year contract so he can renegotiate his wages when the financial situation is better."

">this arrogance when a player decides its not working out

can you please elaborate on that?

As you said - Madrid is the greatest club on the planet - and so are the expectations that come with it. If you are not willing to put your head down and fight for your spot for even one season then there clearly is no place for you in this club.

Look at Valverde. He has the mentality this club expects from you. He shows the patience and hard work needed to succeed here and he's already a fan favourite who many hope to be a future captain"
This is a man who I'd be even be afraid to let go out for a short walk on his own and he's been made the leader of the most powerful nation in the world.
And he has to be wearing that City branded coat he wore last season too.

but to answer on the subject matter, I think these days we're all high on Jokic (and deservedly so) coming out of his MVP season, while kawhi has been battling with serious health issues for a while now.  go back a few years and look at him in his prime, and tell me the guy wasn't a force to be reckoned with."

"he works out harder than you so aren't you being a little bit too  hypocritical right now? And it is irrelevant whether he gets paid for it. You do not need to get paid to want to be as fit as possible. The guy cut down. He looks slim, but nothing is ever enough for couch analysts. Sometimes, things just do not work out. There must not always be someone to blame for it."

Biden spent the first six months in office doing an unprecedented amount of executive orders to undo everything trump had done. But somehow he had no choice here even though he went back on the negotiations trump had set up and changed the date. But yeah he had no choice lol. Makes total sense when you don't think about it.

"Nah he doesn’t jump into ppl for the 3. He gets you to lunge into him on the step back. That’s why I don’t really think a lot of these rules besides the hooking one will affect him as much as everyone thinks.

His game isn’t really based on the fouls. That’s just an awesome side benefit from all the jerky craftiness. All the craftiest guys get to the line. It’s just basketball."

"If you're a poor Socialist, you're jealous; if you're a wealthy Socialist, you're a hypocrite. 

Personally I have no interest in complaining about Hasan choosing to buy a house. He's simply participating in the system that he lives in. In addition to that, he's a very good entry point for young people interested in the Left as a whole - it's no different than if he were a radio talk show host or successful podcaster. He's a media personality and a political pundit, who actively advocates for things that we believe in. He's extremely lucky to be where he's at and was able to buy a house. I don't think he would argue differently."
I paid… I work my arse off and I paid. And everyone enjoyed free happiness because of it. Sad.
"I lost all my guns anyways.

It would be interesting to see what would happen, if we could somehow simulate it, of the government banning firearms here. Obviously we have historical examples, but no other country ever had so many guns per capita. I know I would never give mine up before I lost them. If I still had them, I'd hide some in trees, underground, etc."

"I became socialist quite recently actually (compared to most people). A year ago,me and a friend of mine finished CoD world at war together and i got interested in looking into WW2 more because of the hype from the game. Well one thing led to another and i learned about the contribution of the soviet union. It got me real interested into the USSR and at that time i was more of a meme lord and not really a socialist,but then some videos of explaining the ussr system and explaining socialism popped up in my reccomendations (most notably from YouTubers like Hakim or The Finnish Bolshevik) and i watched those videos and slowly but surely continued watching and learned the basics. Since i was starting to see the major flaws of capitalism and how socialism is generally better,i started reading books that were reccomended by hakim(which i mentioned beforehand) and really that's what made me a socialist. It was a butterfly effect from finishing CoD world at war to getting into WW2 and learning about the USSR and then getting into the system of the USSR and politics. I still have much to learn but yes, that's what made me a socialist.

No. No they didn't
i thought the plan was to get Biden to last until he was in office for 2 years then he resigns. Then not only would Kamala have those 2 years he didn't finish but could still run for Pres twice.

Ah yes set a ridiculous valuation for your own players while trying to low ball other clubs over their valuations.  Good luck
"You talking about ""I"" and then using that to make a consensus for the nation, okay man. Just cause you a LeBron fanboy and love watching him even when he plays bad doesnt mean everybody else does."
"In his defense, he probably barely remembers it

In all seriousness, I feel like this also shows something the Democrats really take advantage of. The media's willingness to do their bidding. If it were some other story, they probably wouldn't be talking about it after 5 days, because they don't want to hurt their fellow Democrats in office. Which is why he's saying this."

"He is the highest paid player for the category he is contracted to. He is contracted to the under 19 and earns more than every player in the b team.

Don't think he'd move to Spurs - he like Bernardo wants to go to Spain if possible. But that has a very low chance of happening given our valuation and Barcelona's and Real's finances.

"Was the Holomidor, something that happened AFTER the civil war, authoritarian? Did that deprive people of civil liberties in favour of a strong central authority lording over the citizens? If not, were Stalin's purges authoritarian? Did Stalin deprive any of the military officials, given show trials and summarily executed for having slightly different political bents, of any of their civil rights in favour of a strong central authority? Also am I just imaging this passage from an article?

"Yea, it’s not like privileged kids of millionaires learn lessons from being humbled. Rivers literally has done nothing wrong besides being overrated when he first entered the league. He’s been help to almost every team he’s gone through, played hard and kept his head down and definitely deserves to be in the nba. Even being honest that he’s not close with his father and giving candid interviews is cool. I really can’t see why the dudes deserved any hate in the last 6 years. He’s humbled the hell out of himself and is just happy to be here still."
Wahhhhh

">his end of season farewell to Arsenal was more heartfelt than this and that’s after a half a season loan.

yeah it's because he was planning on staying.

It was very strange that Odegaard suddenly asked for a loan at RM after six months to move to Arsenal, a club not in La Liga (where he previously was) and who were doing terribly at the time. As a short-term move it made little sense. Turns out he did it because it was a long-term move."
"If that excuse was legitimate they would be going after the vodka and caviar imports as well, but we all know exactly what this was really about."
His first season he also managed Barca's B team. His success there is part of what made it so he was offered the job on the main team.
"People are downvoting me but as someone who has actually watched him a lot, he has *incredible* talent. His main asset is his ability to resist pressing and initiate attacks when the opposition is high up the field. He basically combines the incredible technical ability you would expect from a tricky winger with an exceptional ability to pass the ball under pressure. He’s very unique and it’s better to just watch a highlights video to understand what I mean"
"My guess is that it can affect vulnerable people more often. Like if a young man doesn't have a father figure he'll listen to rap and take after that. Or perhaps he turns to destructive behaviors and rap is just a side affect.

One thing I know for sure is that having a culture that surrounds itself with debauchery is not a good thing."
"western capitalism and especially American capitalism is so tied up with race though. In the U.S. you have a country built by slave labor and also (along with Canada, Australia, and Israel) settler-colonial genocide. you can't pick one to put over the other, building socialism without a very specific aspect to deal with racism (self determination) will perpetuate those old systems. you just can't do one without the other.

"These previous posters do a wonderful job of explaining and offering resources. I just want to highlight the importance of white supremacy within fascism. More often than not (I honestly can’t think of an example off the top of my head that doesn’t fit the description) they go hand in hand. While America isn’t a fascist nation, systemic racism and white supremacy infiltrate every aspect of life in the USA. This along with increasing corporate power and legislative policies that negatively effect racial, sexual, and gender minorities are quickly putting us on a fascist path. More troubling are the amount of democrats and republicans advocating for such policies due to monetary gain through lobbying. Likewise, many southern, working class, (especially white) Americans are promoting and advocating for alt right and white supremacist Ideas. Ideas that directly contradict their current life situations. Ideas that would cause them more issues than benefits and lead to a more authoritative country (something they obviously don’t want but seem to consistently vote for). 
Okay… I’m rambling… sorry."
