"Totally agree, I don't think it stood much of a chance with it's ambitions. But I don't know what was USSR supposed to do then, peacefully co-exist with capitalist world and don't try to separate itself from it? I highly doubt it would've worked, it wasn't that type of country and it wasn't that kind of situation where it was possible. 

Russian Empire was already very outdated when it collapsed, both in technology, society and culture. Devastation of both world wars and civil war had its effect too. Cold War wasn't on equal footing to begin with, and so USSR got obsessed with 'catching up to and overcoming' capitalist world, and obsession like this tends to have a poor effect in the long run, as well as radicalize population. Although from my perspective post-WW2 population of USSR was nowhere near as radicalized and casually spiteful as modern Russian population, which is an interesting thing.

As for many people defending Stalin, well, from their point of view if you don't defend Stalin that came to power not that long after revolution, then you are probably against everything that was after him as Khruschev wouldn't have existed without him. Then you are against pretty much everything USSR was, therefore conservative 'socialists' will be upset with you. They don't care about ideology and theory too much."

"Don Bradman held these records for the 3000, 4000, 5000 and 6000 run marks for a long time (haven't checked the records in a while). He needed 4 runs in his final ever innings to seal a batting average of 100 - the circumstances of this game were such that his team was going to win it by an innings. But he got bowled for a duck (0) and retired with 6996 runs to his names, 70 dismissals and 52 tests played. His career was interrupted by the Second World War, which he signed up to serve in.

The second highest test batting average ever is around 62. Bradman also held a slew of other records such as centuries in single sessions of play, most runs in a day, scored 499 once I think. He played cricket for over 20 years despite the Second World War interrupting him and was by far the world's best player around the age of 39, which has never been emulated since."
"If they had held him in contempt formally (they didn‚Äôt ‚Äì this was just something that was said in a debate, not an actual motion) then it becomes a bit awkward for us (the British) constitutionally. 

Technically, contempt is an offence that parliament has the judicial power to punish itself; and constitutionally that process is outside of the rest of the legal system. Which means things like diplomatic, sovereign and state immunity don‚Äôt apply. So (very theoretically, if he were found to be in contempt by the Commons) he could be arrested and imprisoned for up to two years (or at the next general election, if earlier). (The Lords can imprison for life, but in this example it would be the Commons.)

It‚Äôs constitutionally awkward both because that process would be very contrary to international law, and would complicate the Queen‚Äôs political neutrality ‚Äì convention is she invites every (diplomatically recognised) foreign head of state for a state visit exactly once."

He went two yrs without scoring? You mean the two years were he was injured on and off? Those two years?

Lastly comparing Mbappe and Salah to a player like Hazard based purely on G/A is ignorant, because Hazard was a completely different type of player who‚Äôs impact on the game couldn‚Äôt be measured by stats.(And G/A is the only thing they have over Hazard because by the eye test it was clear who was better)"

"My father was a political refugee, an illegal immigrant who ultimately did the paperwork and became a legal permanent resident.  He ran from Guatemala while civil war was still ravaging it; I'm not clear on details, but he also seemed to have been targeted for things he did back in that country.  He would sometimes talk about how that all had come to be (you may already know the story... the US working to depose a duly elected leader who wanted to return croplands to the people) as well as good things to say about the big name of latino revolutionaries, Che Guevarra.  But when I was a child I didn't understand the economics of the matter.  When presented with ideas of communism, I would think of Che Guevarra, his heroism and how people fondly remembered him.  I had developed a receptiveness to the idea of communism as not being wholly evil, but it was not particularly different in intellectual virtue from being raised to see it as a completely evil system the way most have been.  I may have amounted to a social democrat at best up until last year.  I find human suffering an eyesore.  I don't want to hear about it anymore.  I want a world like those hopeful era sci-fi stories showing humanity united and traveling the stars with all their basic needs already met.  I consider grand problems that stand in the way to realizing that future, and I feel motivated to find solutions to those broad problems.  I am also what could be called a ""compassionate misanthrope"": I want the best for humanity, but continuously observing how difficult humanity makes things for itself and its failures to check or overcome its own dysfunctional natures infuriates me to the point of hatred.  You can imagine a sense of self-hate or unavoidable existential shame plagues me personally with a mindset like this.  I try to avoid it by denying my own humanity.  

It was once I started finding Dr. Richard Wolff in my Youtube recommendations within the past 2-3 years that I began my most significant steps of conversion to socialism, because he clarified the precise distinctions that I never actually took the time to read about: the abolishment of the employer/employee relationship, what ""seizing the means"" actually meant for society, and how the landscape of socialism allowed for multitudes of perspectives to build a society and that even communism has different brands outside of the authoritative and one-party variants.  I felt like I could belong in that camp and that the systemic problems (including tendencies of humanity itself) holding humanity back and threatening it that I had considered before could be adequately addressed by first achieving socialism.  It was the first time I was explicitly thinking with both eyes open to what socialism and communism really were.  Now I'm on board with libertarian socialism and economic overthrow of the corporate model with cooperative models competing with them.  I want to establish a cooperative myself and get to work dismantling capitalism in its capital nation.  Perhaps the rest of the capitalistic world will fall if it does so here first, and, poetically, I could finally exact vengeance for my father's motherland and its people.

The incidents emanating from the pandemic conditions as well as other ongoing patterns (right now my sights are on the video game industry with Ubisoft, Blizzard, Riot Games, etc.) showed me most explicitly that capitalistic rot and the bourgeois class's immense greed and lack of compassion can be assigned a great majority of the blame for many things going wrong, and that socialism can be the solution.  Dr. Richard Wolff, Second Thought, David Pakman (he's emphatically a social democrat rather than a socialist, but still informative), The Rational National, The Majority Report, Ring of Fire, and Jacobin have helped me see things the Marxist way bit by bit until it has come to the point where I learn nothing new about my society and its dismal dystopian state from the senational news pieces they continue to show.  At least the Jacobin and Dr. Wolff go in-depth on the more conceptual and practical elements and provide some useful insights, but the others have basically outlived their use for me with their principle-based news coverage.  They are, however, educating others about the deep and recurring issues affecting our society and why they matter, so I hope their work continues indefinitely.  I just lost patience with the spectacles and verbal shamings of people we cannot even touch right now; I only come up with *lethally* counterproductive ideas when I see rich people or politicians being the problem in news, and the movement would probably not benefit from them."

"lol jesus. you didn't move the goalposts, you fuckin switched the whole damn sport up on me. i don't even really know where to start to unpack this comment, but here goes.  

>The effects a bodily autonomy decision has over others is irrelevant and not included in any definition of the word  

I don't know if english is your second language or you just mistyped or what, but i really don't understand what you're trying to say here. what isn't included in *what* definition of *what* word? 

skipping over that, the entire point of my comment was that you're simplifying the vaccine as ""choosing what to do with their body"", but it's not that simple. Give me an example of somebody making a ""bodily autonomy decision"" that widely effects the people around them like covid does? do you not understand the concept of trying to stop the spread of a virus?  

>Weird that you‚Äôre using the exact same logic as the pro life crowd. Using the effect it has on others as a reason to not allow bodily autonomy is not a road you even want to go down  

lol what? first of all, *nobody* said anything about abortion or pro life/pro choice before you did, i don't even understand where that's coming from or how your brain got that wrapped up in here, but explain to me how the logic of that is the same?  

Somebody gets an abortion, they may cause spiritual pain or emotional distress or whatever you want to even call it to somebody who is religious/anti-abortion/whatever. That's a bummer, life goes on for both parties.  

Somebody comes to work unvaccinated, 3 people get covid and die.

Please for the love of god if Rosas gets his ass on our defense and PF starved team mc I will literally kiss him on the lips.
"Defense for forwards in hockey isn‚Äôt really comparable to basketball in that it‚Äôs not nearly as important. A great offensive player like Gretzky had possession of the puck so often that his way of playing defence was to just have the puck in the offensive zone most of the time.  

Lemieux possibly could have matched Gretzky‚Äôs peak if he didn‚Äôt get injured and have cancer, but it‚Äôs quite unlikely that he matches Gretzky‚Äôs career.  

Before Lemieux came back from retirement, he was the NHL‚Äôs all time leader in points per game, even ahead of Gretzky.  

It should be noted that Lemieux, after coming out of retirement (a retirement forced upon him by cancer and back injuries), came back at age 35, to a brand new ‚Äúera‚Äù of hockey and immediately became the best player in the league.   

As for current players, Ovechkin has a shot to break Gretzky‚Äôs all time goals record. I don‚Äôt think it would change too much in people‚Äôs eyes, as Ovechkin is already widely viewed as the best goal scorer of all time. Gretzky was always more of a playmaker, he just was so good that he also scored a ton of goals, to the point where he still has the most goals scored of all time."

I am anti rich people, and by rich I mean your wealth compared to the people around you. none of that, everyone is rich compared to people in poor countries. but that feeling of anti rich people is separate from socialism, I just think its a moral failing. If you become rich then imo you have a moral obligation to use it to help others.

If you come into a lot of wealth its perfectly acceptable to use it to live a life free from wage slavery, to live comfortably. but a $3 million dollar home is beyond what is reasonable imo. And I'd lose respect for anyone who instead of using their new found wealth to help others, they use it to buy frivolous shit... like a 3 million dollar house."

"Conversely it was pretty dubious the Canadian government was ever going to approve it, and TC corp made it clear it was abandoning the pipeline. Laying that entirely at Biden's feet is dubious at best.

They may not know why or how, but they can realize that capitalism is broken.
However the general population does not have a class analysis.
They don't view the world through a dialectical and materialist lens.
So most default to tinfoil hat conspiracy theories and the like.

People bring up the extensive amounts of red scare propaganda and Mccarthyism that the US population was/is subjected to, and this is part of it.

Another important reason that is often pushed aside is that, it is actually in the interests of certain portions of the US population to preserve imperialism.
The US has a labor aristocracy which is pampered by profits from imperialist plunder.
This section of the population, which is quite large, has no real revolutionary potential."

But if not, then tank away, and collect draft assets.

The problem is there are no guarantees from tanking. You cant tell your fanbase that within 3 years we will have a foundation and within 5 years we will contend.

"Just like when Fergie left Utd, we found out just how much of a creaking ship Wenger had been holding together almost entirely by himself. Wenger found great success early in his career by using statistics and heuristics to find the best underpriced players. He still had an eye for talent and was a fantastic man manager just unable to compete with the torrents of cash that is in the game now. Mid table teams are able to spend more than Juve or Bayern or Valencia, it's insane. 

With the right recruitment and manager we could be Liverpool, but we're never going to be City or Chelsea or even Utd."

"[Trotsky's position on trade unions is remarkably clear.](https://www.marxist.com/classics-marxism-one-book/the-transitional-program.htm)

>The Bolshevik-Leninist stands in the front-line trenches of all kinds of struggles, even when they involve only the most modest material interests or democratic rights of the working class. He takes active part in mass trade unions for the purpose of strengthening them and raising their spirit of militancy. He fights uncompromisingly against any attempt to subordinate the unions to the bourgeois state and bind the proletariat to ‚Äúcompulsory arbitration‚Äù and every other form of police guardianship‚Äînot only fascist but also ‚Äúdemocratic.‚Äù Only on the basis of such work within the trade unions is successful struggle possible against the reformists, including those of the Stalinist bureaucracy. Sectarian attempts to build or preserve small ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù unions, as a second edition of the party, signify in actuality the renouncing of the struggle for leadership of the working class. It is necessary to establish this firm rule: self-isolation of the capitulationist variety from mass trade unions, which is tantamount to a betrayal of the revolution, is incompatible with membership in the Fourth International.

Certainly, the trade unions are often bureaucratic, reactionary, reformist, and all manner of other words. But that's absolutely no reason not to work in them, or to set up as WSWS suggests, 'rank-and-file committees' at the workplace. Simply put, the trade unions are where you find the masses, particularly the most politically advanced layers. 

So in this instance, the WSWS breaks with the Trotskyist position on trade unions (which is quite a significant break indeed, as Trotsky wrote that such a move makes you *incompatible with membership of the fourth international*).

I'll also quote [this article](https://www.marxist.com/britain-sectarianism-demise-ssp-socialist-party080507.htm).

>The problem is not with the working class, which hasn't moved en masse at this stage, but with the sectarian's lack of confidence in the working class. They talk about the inability of the working class to change the Labour Party, due to the lack of democracy in the party. The sects used this argument in the past about not being able to change the TGWU, the GMB or the EEPTU. But they were proved wrong! When the working class moves no amount of bureaucratic rules will prevent it from changing its organizations. That has been the lesson of history, and it is for Marxists to learn the lessons of history and not repeat its mistakes.

>...Before the working class will move to change society, they will first of all attempt to transform their traditional organizations from top to bottom. This is quite logical as workers draw different conclusions at different times and tend to take the line of least resistance."

"This is the primary reason why I think so many politicians have been more than happy to enact all these mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns.

What's one of the worst things you can be seen doing as a politician? Nothing. Even if doing something will be worse than if you did nothing, the masses will demand that you ""Just do somethinggg!!1!"". Most all of them also need to be re-elected, and/or have a strong desire to stay in the spotlight for various reasons.

So, by enacting these incredibly harmful mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns, it's a great way to, well, cover their own ass. They can virture signal as much as they want, and claim how they just care soooo much about people. If (when) all those things fail to make a difference, they can always shift the blame to the people for not doing well enough. Just look at how the media and social media cover politicians who have kept open vs. ones who shut everything down. Not to mention the obvious power that comes from something like this. ""Never let a good crisis go to waste.""

Then, you have all the politicians in the world who don't need a reason to oppress and fuck over their own people, but certainly love a good excuse to. Especially when you have so many people begging for it.

In addition, the media and all the ""experts"" obviously want this to continue as long as possible. The media is more popular now than ever, between big scary virus and orangemanbad. There's good money and views to be had from keeping people terrified and paranoid. And all the ""experts"" certainly don't want to fade back into irrelevance, sort of like the media.

This ""pandemic"" was over long ago in many countries, US included. It's an absolute joke how people continue to be terrified and paranoid of this virus with a stupidly high survival rate. Essentially everyone has had an opportunity to receive the vaccine if they want it. The role of government in all of this is all but over, and we should all be completely getting back to our lives at this point."

3. He wasn't politically correct and so no need to be so
4. He wasn't into ""appearances"" something the ""intellectual class"" is fixated on.  Notice the number of them that ""appear"" to support ""woke"" causes but actually do not
5. He was into national pride, something the intellectual class hates because raping Americans greatly benefits their pocketbook

Probably a few more reasons."

Even if it‚Äôs not mandated, I would like to see far more social pressure on those unwilling to do their civic duty. Far too many feel like not getting vaccinated is patriotic. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs idiotic."
">Nothing about those numbers point directly at Steph, and he's 7th in jersey sales. People obviously really like Steph, but the hype around the team extends further than just Curry.

True that the hype extends beyond Curry, but none of the top 6 jersey sellers above Curry are Warriors players. The Warriors without Curry is not a draw for getting additional incremental fans."

"Depends what you mean by socialism. There are so many different things which have called or call themselves 'socialist' that it becomes meaningless to ask 'what are the problems of *socialism*?'.

For example, the problems of Blanquism, Kropotkinist anarcho-communism, Maoism, and Social Revolutionary terrorism are completely different. The problems of 1930s Anarcho-syndicalist Spain, 2020s socialism 'with Chinese characterics', 1970s Cuban Marxist-Leninism, and 1950s Swedish social democracy are very different. Even the problems of 1920s USSR and 1980s USSR are very different.

If I had to pick one generic thing, I'd say the biggest problem of socialists and socialism as applied in practice throughout history has been lack of participatory democracy. A relatively small group of people deciding that they will control things. This was not new in the USSR in the 20s (for example, in the 19th century you had the Blanquists who were conspiratorial elitist authoritarian revolutionaries, Charles Fourier whose utopian socialism involved an enlightened elite designing and establishing ideal communities for the masses, or many Social Democrats who wanted to lead the masses rather than let the masses lead themselves).

This problem was intensified after the 1917 revolution because Bolshevism gained a worldwide prestige which eventually lead to 'socialism' becoming synonymous with 'Bolshevism' for most socialists. And *particularly* after Stalin replaced Lenin. So 'socialism' came to mean a society where democracy is taken perhaps even less seriously than in a liberal capitalist republic. Lack of democracy is not a problem unique to Leninism though.

(I'm not trying to be sectarian, just answering the question honestly)"

"Arteta is working as more of a transition manager. There‚Äôs too many problems with the squad, so a longer rebuild is needed, then depending on his performance they can decide if they will get a new manager.

It‚Äôs the same case with Lampard and Ole. Had the ban period been longer for Chelsea, Lampard might have done better. The ambition of Abramovich with the players he brought in meant that Lampard had to compete short term, and he didn‚Äôt have the capacity to do so. Ole however had a dream start albeit a terrible drop straight after, but he got lucky with Bruno saving the team, and managed to buy him time to stabilise the squad and his seat."

It was all a plan.
"The way I see it is that inflation helps the ruling elites hide wage cuts and stagnation. For example; in 1950 in America the minimum wage was 75 cents an hour. You might think that the current minimum wage of $7.25 is a decent increase of over 950%. However if you account for inflation that 75 cent is equivalent to $8.28 today. Which means in reality minimum wage earners have taken a pay cut of over 10% in the last 70 years.

MMT is not so worried about inflation as long as it isn't hyperinflation. It is an idea to increase the spending power of the government without raising taxes (mainly on the rich and corporations) by means of money printing. 

MMT is nothing more than a regressive tax system in my eyes. This is because it keeps corporate tax low and decreases the wages of working people by reducing the buying power of their wages. And in the end there is no practical difference between paying more of your wage into taxes, or inflation causing your wage to be worth less. Either way workers get less for their labor."
"I grew up in Pittsburgh....Gretzky is better. Lemieux great great player worthy status as the no 2, but people overdo the ""what if he hadnt had lymphoma"" to the point of overrating the hypothetical version of healthy Lemieux because it was such an amazing story that he came back and still dominated after it. People also feel bad for him which is a big part of it. Hell even after retiring just came back in 2000 MJ style and started carving up the league. But Gretzky was better"

There are a few things you have to accept though: we won‚Äôt get a star through free agency, Lebron and AD type players are never going to force themselves here unless they have some tie already, and we likely aren‚Äôt going to competing for a championship unless everything goes right. When you accept that, you just have to set proper expectations."

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Golden State Warriors. The passing is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the backscreens will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Kerr‚Äôs kumbaya outlook, which is deftly woven into his playbook - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Marxist literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these plays, to realize that they‚Äôre not just basketball - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike GSW truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the complexity in Kerr‚Äôs existencial catchphrase ""Strength in Numbers"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Harry C. Triandis‚Äôs ‚ÄúIndividualism and Collectivism.‚Äù I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Joe Lacob‚Äôs genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

"He gets paid under contract as a proportion of the ad revenue, which goes up by his viewership. Two things happened, First, Trump and the election caused a massive jump to his viewership, streaming his normal hours but to a 100k audience at the height of the Pres election. Second, covid. Pretty much every major streamer made bank because everyone was at home starved of entertainment, everyone's viewership doubled. Also, the streamers weren't going out anywhere, weren't taking holidays.

  
Basically, he has a normal, non-exploitative, scale-able contract, and history just gave him two years of a massive viewership boost.

  
Edit: Can I just add - putting details of a streamers home, layout, location etc online like this is pretty shitty. Normal every day gaming streamers don't even put a camera anywhere near a window so that the worst of fans and haters can't try work out where they live, to display this guys home, when he's a leftie in that environment and one of the biggest profiles is down-right dangerous."

"It was a power vacuum and those will always be filled. The Afghan government wasn't in a spot to hold their own and I get the feeling the US government knows it and has known it. 
President Biden has a unique chance here to call an end to the failure of Wilsonian foreign policy. He could say that the USA has spent ungodly sums of money and thousands of American troop's lives and it's time to accept that we did not achieve our goals despite 20 years and 3 different presidential administrations making some kind of attempt at it. Now is the time to leave this conflict to the history books. 

The people of Afghanistan are going to have to choose their own path. The United States needs to move away from decades of bad foreign policy and Afghanistan can be the catalyst that does it. This could be a win for the left in the USA as a rejection of America's imperial past, framed as a return to commerce and trade vs. intervention and conflict. 
Of course, we know that commerce and trade is really exploitation of others but baby steps."

If he had stayed in OKC and gotten it done there like Giannis did, I think there would be no dispute right now."

but instead, we take ""climate change is no longer reversible"" as evidence of our own demise and, in so doing, we abdicate responsibility for what comes next. no one can ask us to do hard work we don't understand how to do if it's all beyond our capacity to effect. it's a form of seductive nihilism, the sweet and silent call of the void, the siren drawing us ever nearer by promising us certain demise.

resist her call! capitalism has doomed itself but it hasn't doomed *us*. we can still rally people together to survive!"

">I think a pure ""tankie"" would disagree as a worker-owned cooperative is privately owned and still must compete in a capitalist system.

Interesting. I tend to consider more the structure of the business itself. If it's an employer/employee relationship then it's capitalist, if it's a co-op or other such arrangement so that the workers own or otherwise have control (even if by way of an intermediary bureaucracy) then it's socialist.

A business is simply competing in a market and though it \*does\* matter (e.g. to me) whether the competition operates in a socialist or capitalist way, it really doesn't matter. Like if  you were in a race; you don't really care if the car next to you is making their decisions via a top-down authoritarian structure or democratically."

"Western mainstream media has given Putin too much credit. That has been mostly good for Putin, since it makes him look stronger than he actually. And in Russia you get points if you look strong. Since Ivan the Terrible, the strongmen have been successful. 

From what I know, Putin's power is based on the fact that he has Russia's most powerful oligarchs backing him. That is also a weakness; what if the oligarchs abandon him? Putin has currently a strong grip on Russia (he can basically get almost anybody killed or exiled) but that might not be the case forever. He can very well be ousted one day. Some new guy can rise from the shadows (just like Putin did) and take the lead.

But you can never really know what is going on in Russia. The country has always been very secretive. And Russian people are very skeptical towards their leaders. They might act like they love Putin, but behind closed doors it's totally different story. They aren't dumb or mindless. It's not like with Trump and his supporters who actually believe almost anything their leader says. And especially young Russians are very anti-Putin."

> and ya Venezuela is a dictatoshship and a third world country

Now they are, yes.  20 years ago, Venezuela was the richest country in Latin America.  Then they decided to try socialism.  The socialists thought it would be a great idea to nationalize industry and bribe the people with the wealth from it.  ...and the industry failed as a result.  The socialists also (wisely for their continuing in power) banned private firearm ownership, and did buybacks and confiscations.  Then they changed the government into what is effectively a dictatorship.  Now the people are starving and they ran out of zoo animals to eat years ago, and only the government has guns.

"The leftist point of view is neutral. 

Simply put, a reactionary foreign power has left Afghanistan and a reactionary domestic force has toppled the foreigner's puppet government. 

The difference is basically aesthetic. 

Bad guys replaced bad guys. This is neither a positive or negative situation, it's just neutral. 

The big positive take away is that it's another signal that the American Empire is crumbling so we can cheer that and laugh at them for their failure. 

But otherwise we simply do what we always do, express concern and show solidarity for the Afghan people, and extend our support, where possible, to any  homegrown communist and anarchist revolutionaries on the ground in Afghanistan, hoping that they'll be able to free their country from reaction once and for all.

"Don‚Äôt forget all of the most brilliant professors, scientists, and doctors. But they just brainwash everyone so fuck Em right?"
"New studies get more traction in the press. Sometimes studies miss people the first time around. The scientific approach also looks for reproducible results so the more studies you have saying similar things but done slightly differently the more you confirm the situation from an empirical point of view. The value of that can be debated but it's the kind of thing you need to make some level of headway on the situation. 

&#x200B;

Getting this stuff out in the broader media is also important because not everyone is engaged enough to catch things the first time around. Some people might forget and need to be reminded. 

&#x200B;

Also, situations change over time. So updating the data and showing how bad things still are or how they have gotten worse not better is important too.

&#x200B;

I do agree that having the studies and doing little or nothing to fix the situation makes the data fairly useless. We've known how bad things are in a general sense for decades and our country overall continues to support the genocide, which is horrifying."

Their owner is a boyhood/local fan, got them a new stadium, and has generally been very open to the fans. On the whole their success in recent years has been more ""organic"" than other PL clubs."
People will rag on him for being a product of nepotism which is an actual fair criticism of him but when people bring this up and how it helped him get to where he is he uses it as an example of why capitalism is a terrible system. Its stupid that he is able to make that much money and the fact that someone who is a self proclaimed dumbass can make a killing because of all the luck he was birthed into. Instead of claiming it was all him he admits to this and points to it in fundamental flaws in the system and why it needs to be changed from the ground up. It is very easy to just judge someone based on their income alone but he has been very consistent in his views at least which is a lot more you can say about most other leftist content creators. I disagree with him on how a lot of things should be done but trying to kick people with actual influence of a leftist movement will do a lot more harm than good

"Lol it's not screwing over the franchise if they only get 2 picks instead of 5.  The difference with making a S&T happen and signing a 5 year ""with the understanding they would help trade him in a year"" is it takes ALL of the power away from Beal.  So what if Boston makes another ""bad offer"" again.  The Wizards tell Beal they couldn't milk enough out of the Celtics so he has to stay another year?  The S&T makes it an absolute that he goes where he wants to go.  The Wizards had a chance to trade Beal last offseason for a massive haul.  They can trade him again this season for a good haul.  If they wait until next offseason, they will have almost no leverage and be at the mercy of where Beal wants to play.  And if he wants to play for a team over the cap, I guarantee you the Wizards will help facillitate it because getting something back to let him play for the Celtics is better than screwing themselves, Beal and the Celtics over just so he can sign with San Antonio, Detroit etc.

&#x200B;

Look at the Jimmy Butler S&T again.  The Sixers literally only got Josh Richardson back.  Lowry only netted Precious and a bad Dragic contract.  If the Wizards wanted an actual return for Beal, they should have traded him last year.  

&#x200B;

But why would Boston want to do Smart and 5 firsts this year without a long term guarantee on Beal (he would not do an extension because he could get more with a new contract) when they can do 2 firsts and guarantee Beal for at least 3 years next offseason.  If Beal signs elsewhere next season (anywhere, not just Boston), I guarantee you the Wizards will facillitate a S&T and it will be for much lower than Beal's value.  The point of a S&T isn't to net equal value for Beal, it's so he can play where he wants to play, and the Wizards get a little something back for playing nice.  Like I said, they aren't going to screw themselves, Beal and whoever is signing him just to spite that team."

Prior to Giannis it's generally well established the top PFs in history are Duncan, Dirk, Malone, KG, Chuck.

More rings, fmvps, dpoys and as many MVPs as Malone

As many rings, more finals MVPs, more MVPs and as many dpoys as KG

As many rings, as many finals MVPs, more MVPs and more dpoys than Dirk

Accolades obviously aren't everything, of course. But if you take accolades alone that puts literally just Timmy ahead of Giannis.

"I broadly agree. I don't think we need to wait until socialism to transition away from the current animal exploitation systems. A lot could be done before then, as in, a lot of the capacity to transition is there already.

Similarly, you don't need a socialist society to have a Just Transition from fossil fuels to other energy sources.

I think it's important to put it in its environmental context because that informs the appropriate time scales. Since animal agriculture is one of the greatest polluters, both of GHGs and of water sources (as well as destroying the soil), we need to phase out the bulk of it in quite a short time. So the more 'narrow' ethical aim of humans not exploiting other animals unnecessarily overlaps with the 'wider' aim of not collapsing the Earth's biosphere.

For example, I live in a country (Ireland) where 1/3 of emissions are produced by agriculture, which basically means animal agriculture. We can't be waiting generations to comfortably transition, it has to happen soon."

That‚Äôs not even factoring in the possibility of overachieving through good management, something Wenger and even Emery did to a degree. 

And it‚Äôs not surprising. He has ZERO management experience prior to getting the Arsenal role. Would people be so enamoured by his ‚Äúpotential‚Äù if he was a ugly bold fat Yorkshireman who used to be Big Sam‚Äôs assistant but achieved the EXACT same results as Arteta and played they EXACT same football?

"the problem is that one of the soviet projects in central asia was to construct distinct national identities for the present-day central asian countries. as arbitrary as the borders are, they actually follow more or less along the cultural lines artificially forged by propaganda during the last century. (to be clear, central asia was multiethnic beforehand as well, but ethnic dynamics only recently became a foundation for nationalism in the region.) 

it's also very hard to undo the legacy of soviet hegemony on a number of levels: many changes to regional ecosystems (industrial production of monocrop cotton, destruction of the aral sea, fallout from nuclear tests etc) are at least semipermanent, while industrialization has driven irrevocable shifts in daily life for central asian populations. it's an unfortunate situation with few ""good"" paths forward; decolonization is unfortunately not a panacea for the permanent legacy of its inverse."

"I think you're conflating social democracy and democratic socialism.

Social democracy does not seek to establish socialism, just a kinder version of capitalism.

Democratic socialism seeks to establish socialism (and thus communism, eventually) through the parliamentary system and reform.

People can argue that democratic socialism inherently devolves into social democracy (and thus capitalism), as you have, but for people new to these ideas (like OP), it's important to differentiate clearly.

Edit: I looked a bit more into the origin of the terms, and it seems that conflating them is not uncommon. That said, I still think it would be generally good for OP to understand some nuance."

"Marx, as a good heir of the young hegelians, was certainly opposed to the essence of religion. But he, along with a lot of other XVIII-XIX century thinkers, failed to understand the way it has become interwoven with social change. 

Just as there are movements built on a relationship between nation, ethnicity, and socialism, religion often forms part of these cultures. For example, the very memeable crucifix Evo Morales gifted to Pope Francis is a direct allusion to ‚ÄúLiberation Theology‚Äù socialism, and the ideas of marxist-jesuit revolutionary Luis Camps (that is a real thing). As to why these movements exist, it‚Äôs in my opinion because of three reasons: 1) the obvious socialist content in christianism; 2) the widespread adoption of christianism after the european invasions; and 3) the tactical utility of embracing syncretism rather than atheism as a way to galvanize the masses, and simultaneously, to take away power from the reactionary church. 

Whether or not this is ‚Äústill‚Äù marxist is up to debate, but it‚Äôs certainly socialist. You probably know that a lot of the direct precursors of Marx, like Saint-Simon or Weitling, were ‚Äúreligious socialists‚Äù, and indeed socialism has largely been tied to religion throughout history. Personally, I believe these global south movements to be ‚Äúmarxian‚Äù, as they still uphold some of its developments and theory despite adapting them to their material needs ‚Äî which Marx obviously couldn‚Äôt foresee entirely."

"> and were (relative to his era) equivalent to KD/Curry GSW.

KD and curry were both mvp level players who were each individually capable of being the best guys on 60+ win teams that could make the finals. in their primes. they both have multiple scoring titles. pippen's best scoring year was 22ppg on above-average efficiency. that's it. you can't have pippen as your #1 guy and make the finals. pippen was a great player, but he was not a true #1 option on any team going deep in the playoffs due to his lack of offense. if jordan and barkley had teamed up in their primes, that would be similar. one guy as the main scoring option with a good 2nd option and some good pieces around him is not a team that's anything like as stacked, even ""relative to their era"", to KD gsw

rodman was a great fit with the bulls but what he was great at was rebounding and defense exclusively, he was not providing a 3rd option on offense like kyrie is for the nets or like klay was for the KD warriors. he was not going off for 40. and they didn't have grant and rodman at the same time. you're conflating different eras"

Is all mainstream economics bullshit? I don't know if we can say that. It's generally, politically bullshit and serves the ruling class, but there does exist things even in orthodox economics which has real life application, most notably in fields like business economics.  


One thing that does seem to connect Marxist economists seems to be that they all interpret the LTV differently. Hudson's ideas is for sure interesting, but it's very much his own thing."

"Love the love from a Spurs fan for Garnett. 

KG's peak was so high, and I really wish he had won a championship that MVP year. 

People don't recognize just how good his 2003 season was. 

It's a top 30 season of all time. By win shares that peak KG year is better than the best seasons of Tim Duncan, Kobe, Dirk, Steph Curry, Karl Malone, Chris Paul, Jerry West.

By VORP that season is the 10th best season of all time.

That year KG was Michael Jordan in 1996 level of play.

But alas, he was surrounded by awful players his whole career, and my favorite player will probably be forgotten because he only got one ring."

"Yes that‚Äôs how democratic centralism works. The party decides on the candidate they want to represent them, and put them forward as the party candidate. It doesn‚Äôt mean other party members couldn‚Äôt run as a union candidate. Just that there was a member that was selected as the party‚Äôs candidate. Standards were in place to guarantee that the candidate was a worker, had a good record and played a role in local politics before they were selected. Which is why the candidate was usually chosen.

"That's also true, but I meant ""artificial"" as in overly relying on foreign support to continue existing. While it is evident that Israel is trying to create a self-sufficient ethnostate, I don't think self-sufficiency is achievable by them and palestinians continue to exist as a culture despite their best efforts. Then, removing this foreign support would mean an immediate crisis, in a parallel to how colonial regimes faced disintegration when their ""parent"" country withdrew support for them."

"I feel like that‚Äôs the biggest difference between Werner and Morata in his time with Chelsea. Similar problems with finishing, but Werner just keeps with it and works on the field as though nothing frustrating happened, whereas Morata literally regressed throughout the games because he couldn‚Äôt control the mental pressure of his shortcomings on the pitch. Never forget, the man got 2 yellows as a substitute in overtime, the second one being for whining to the ref after a dive. A major disparity between their mental strenght."
"From the article:

> There is no out and out threshold for the number of positive cases which would cause a game to be called off but it is understood a club would need to contact the League to make such a request.

> When Arteta was asked whether he or the club had requested for the game to be called off, he replied: ""What we did is what we had to do, through the club, through the club doctor as well. He explained the situation, how it developed and the risk that we consider.""

It sounds like they didn't even request to move the game, in which case it is on Arsenal. Probably didn't bother as they knew it wasn't enough to get the game postponed anyway."

"This seems disingenuous in the use of religion to accomplish an end and control a population. In my opinion a person should never be an end, and I would say--to do such, or use humanity in such a way would be an immoral action. I totally understand it, and the utility but I do not think it has a stable moral foundation. 

I do not know your cultural values or experiences, but there are functional governments with a high compartmentalization of religious values and governmental functioning. It is an accepted fact that religion should not play a role in the government, it's laws,  and likewise the regulation of religious ideas should not be regulated by governmental actors (due to the power contained in religious ideology which you mentioned). 

I think that there are many paths which could be followed but as the OP seems to be hinting at, and if so I agree, establishing a religious fueled version of socialism would have a higher likelihood of turning into a modified theocracy, it would be much better in the long run to have strong socialistic ideology with a possible acceptance of belief in religious thought. I think the opiate of the masses idea is more about the use and enforcement of religious morality. Socialism (again my opinion) is not compatible with nearly any world religion, perhaps certain Native American religions or maybe Buddhism would be the closest I can think of. There are very good lessons to be learned from different religions, but any religion which has an inability to change based on the growth in knowledge should not used as a guide for society. 

Rigidity is what causes organizations to include government to fail. Homogeneity leads to incestuous ideas which build on themselves, which causes love of a cause or ideology over (quality of) life. The prime example is Capitalism in America, or many other empires.  

I agree there is a difference in church and religion, church is a structured institution based on religion and religion is a set of beliefs and values. It just feels unnecessary, not to be extremely insulting, but many practitioners pick and choose which values they choose to follow (based on a limited set of values), so biases are implicit. Religion should be entirely individual and not in establishment of a society."

"> Pep ball requires very high talent of players to accomplish

I don't understand how people keep saying this, when there are so many examples to the contrary.

Quique Seti√©n at Las Palmas.

Roberto De Zerbi at Sassuolo.

Graham Potter at Brighton.

Marcelo Bielsa at Bilbao and Leeds.

Jorge Sampaoli and Julen Lopetegui at Sevilla.

There are a lot of examples of managers successfully implementing the basics of Pep's football at clubs without insane resources or squads stacked with world class players. By that I mean an emphasis on possession, playing out from the back etc. It's like people still think every non big club still plays hoofball, but that's far from true."

Marxism used to be really popular in the South and W.Bengal but over the years there's a lot of internal issues arising and a lot of the parties have disintegrated from the major parties and have formed their own and some of them have been outlawed by the Govt. A lot of the student unions that are in power on university campuses are leftist or left coalitions which is why the Govt. is increasingly privatising education making it really expensive for marginalised people. I wouldn't really call myself a socialist more like an ally because I don't have much theoretical knowledge and a lot of the campus politics revolve around academic discussions so I'm not too into that. An issue I have with socialists in India is that they often don't address the issue of intersectionality in the Indian context. This has led to the alienation of people from marginalised communities but they still form alliances with the left. I still prefer leftists over right wing fascists or the centrists who are basically still right wing. The leftist people I've met on campus have generally been more supportive of marginalised issues. People like me often get labelled as ""Chinese communist party rice bag converts"" (because Christian, and indigenous with east asian features lol) whenever we demand anything that is in our interest. My region of origin is also under heavy monitoring by the Indian army who have done atrocious things to our people to quell independence movements in the past. I think part of the reason I don't want to play a more active role in these socialist movements especially in the capital has to do with fear of being targeted by the right because activists are often jailed for no legitimate legal reasons whenever protests happen, especially activists from marginalised communities. There's also a lot of laws that are from the British era that are disproportionately used against marginalised dissenters. The same laws used against Indian freedom fighters by the British."

"You're kind of leaving out the historical context where he original antifa was specifically associated with the German communist party. They wanted to destroy the Weimar Republic just as much as the Nazis. The only difference is what they wanted in its place, namely a Marxist-Leninist dictatorship of the proletariat.

In general, extremist movements have frequently organized under the guise of ""anti-fascism"" and ""anti-communism."" And they have done exactly what you're doing, ""you're either with us, or you literally support communism.""

So yeah, you can be opposed to antifa and opposed to fascism at the same time. And you can recognize that many people in the US who organize/protest under the banner of antifa are violent anarchist dickheads."

"I take exception from the title all the way through the last word of the article. You said the connection between the party and the location does exist, I called bullshit.

That's like insinuating that the only reason covid spreads in Martha's vineyard is because of Obama's party. Which is fucking ridiculous to say.

It's about 10 trillion times more likely that Martha's vineyard's current situation is caused by the Delta variant spreading across Martha's vineyard., And that Obama's party has little to no direct connection to that. Was it a contributing factor? Sure, probably a tiny bit. But the simple fact is Martha's vineyard is a socialite paradise, rich people live lavish lives and have parties over there. Obama is far from the only inhabitant of it.

In summary, the article is trying to push a connection that it can't possibly make. Actually, no, let me rephrase, the article is trying to claim that the party was the cause.

That is crystal clear."

Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois? Should we not, on the contrary, reproach it for not having used it freely enough?

Therefore, either one of two things: either the anti-authoritarians don't know what they're talking about, in which case they are creating nothing but confusion; or they do know, and in that case they are betraying the movement of the proletariat. In either case they serve the reaction.""

"Covid is simply not ""bringing the health care system to its knees"".  If that were the case, governments would not have dismantled field hospitals and would not be laying off hundreds of workers at a time.

The *maximum* at any given point during the pandemic was 20% of the beds being taken up by Covid patients.  Far and away, the most common reason to visit the hospital is due to circulatory issues (heart attack, stroke, heart failure, etc.).  The next most common is respiratory (tract infections, pneumonia, COPD).... which are exacerbated by being unhealthy.  If everyone just ate healthier, hospitals would be ghost towns except for childbirth."

I think it‚Äôs because a nation is socialist doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be imperialist. I have family who fought in the Chinese incursion of Vietnam and from what I know about it it occurred because of the Sino-Soviet split and Vietnam taking the side of the USSR. As a result the PRC invalided northern Vietnam to essentially solve some boarder conflicts and gain a newly united Vietnam into the Chinese sphere of influence.

"I think there‚Äôs a lot of examples showing how bombing has always caused destabilization like in Iran when Trump bombed Qasem Soleimani it caused Iran to vote in a far right leader who will actually build nuclear war heads or how after Obama bombed Libya (on of the most successful nation in Africa at that the time), they now have an open slave market and so many other times how bombing creates destabilization.

I think this is a better way to go about it. Ask them what would they do if their homes got continuously bombed. Your friends and family dying by air strikes from a country over 7000 miles away. All this while your current administration does little to help your current conditions. What do you do? I‚Äôd get mad. I don‚Äôt want my friends to die from this foreign threat I‚Äôve never met in my entire life. 

This is why people join terrorist organizations. They are angry. This anger will only continue as a result. What the richest countries in the world need to do is set up humanitarian aid programs and improve the living conditions the people. However, this is very unlikely from a country like the US. Instead we have to advocate for reduction and eventually elimination of foreign wars and acts of aggression."

"[**Ulrike Meinhof**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulrike_Meinhof)

Ulrike Marie Meinhof (7 October 1934 ‚Äì 9 May 1976) was a German left-wing journalist and founding member of the Red Army Faction (RAF) in West Germany, commonly referred to in the press as the ""Baader-Meinhof gang"". She is the reputed author of The Urban Guerilla Concept (1971). The manifesto acknowledges the RAF's ""roots in the history of the student movement""; condemns ""reformism"" as ""a brake on the anti-capitalist struggle""; and invokes Mao Zedong to define ""armed struggle"" as ""the highest form of Marxism-Leninism"".Meinhof, who took part in the RAF's May Offensive in 1972, was arrested in June of that year and spent the rest of her life in custody, largely isolated from outside contact.

[**Red Army Faction**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Faction)

The Red Army Faction (RAF, German: […õ Å îaÀêÀà î…õf] (listen); German: Rote Armee Fraktion, pronounced [Àå ÅoÀê.t…ô a ÅÀàmeÀê f ÅakÀåtÕ°siÃØoÀên] (listen)), also known as the Baader‚ÄìMeinhof Group or Baader‚ÄìMeinhof Gang (German: Baader-Meinhof-Gruppe, Baader-Meinhof-Bande, German: [ÀàbaÀêd…ê Ààma…™ÃØnÀåh…îf Àà…° Å äp…ô] (listen)), was a West German far-left militant organization founded in 1970. Key early figures included Andreas Baader, Ulrike Meinhof, Gudrun Ensslin, and Horst Mahler, among others. The government of the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as most Western media and literature, considered the Red Army Faction to be a terrorist organization.

[**Siegfried Hausner**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegfried_Hausner)

Siegfried Hausner (24 January 1952 ‚Äì 5 May 1975) was a student member of the German Socialist Patients' Collective who was sentenced to three years imprisonment in 1972 for terrorist related crimes. When he was released in 1974, like many other former members of the SPK, he joined the Red Army Faction.  

[**Andreas Baader**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Baader)

Berndt Andreas Baader (6 May 1943 ‚Äì 18 October 1977) was one of the first leaders of the West German left-wing militant organization Red Army Faction (RAF), also commonly known as the Baader-Meinhof Group.

"I've got some ideas about teaching people how to problem solve using groups. That seems to me to be the fundamental unit of socialism, no? If people are taught *how* to organise themselves, and can teach others to self organise in turn, then a more just and democratic society can be achieved.
We can't depend on leaders to emerge, or great schools of thought to be disseminated. They're too easy of targets for disruption and sabotage. We need simple , memetic  tools that can be proliferated quickly along social sidechannels.

"Well first even though I believe Luffy would win I think it would be a high-diff if not extreme-diff. Pre-1010 Luffy could still use Advanced CoA, and the higher level of it. His ACoA attacks such as Red Roc are far higher in attack potency than anything Fujitora has shown so far. Red Roc did meaningful damage to base Kaido, who I expect to be much more durable than Fujitora. We don‚Äôt even know for absolute certain that Fujitora has ACoA.
&nbsp;

Fujitora‚Äôs Devil Fruit is very strong, but against someone of this level I think it would only be good to slow Luffy down and crowd control him. Luffy has shown he can take a glancing Thunder Bagua to the head without being KO‚Äôd. I don‚Äôt see how Fujitora does enough damage to take Luffy down.

Fujitora has shown a high level of CoO, but we don‚Äôt know for sure if he has Future Sight or not. Luffy definitely does. CoO is one of Fujitora‚Äôs best attributes yet Luffy still matches it."

Sometimes laypeople need to realise that they don't know as much about a subject as a professional in the field.

"The Bucks and Raptors have very similar looks imo. The raptors had 59 wins their championship year and the years before they were 58 and the year AFTER they were 53.

The bucks had something similar go on. Had 46 wins in a 72 game season(Comparable to a 52 win season), And they won 56 and 60 games the previous years. They had a bunch of breaks as well too from injuries to other teams to KD's toe. 

Is Giannis the BEST player currently? Everyone claims Kwahi was when he won... So some modicum of respect must be given. KD did as much as he could but he didnt win! 

And also lets give respect to the players in the past - Is Giannis comparable to Duncan? Hell no. Just fyi dude won ROY, an championship, and a finals MVP within a calendar year. And he just played ONLY 132 regular season games(playoffs not included) and started EVERY GAME. He's not even on Garnett's level yet(atleast the bucks tried to put a team around Giannis)."

New Poll Says Most Polls Are Bullshit.
"It's like complaining about alcoholism and how alcohol manufacturers are destroying society while receiving millions in sponsoring from Jack Daniels and actively participating in their promotion campaigns.

This sub is peak hypocrisy it's mind blowing, the fact that you don't even see how old clubs like Bayern are as much responsible of the current situation as clubs as City or PSG is hilarious at this point.

""Leading to an inflated market"" lmao, like Juve spending 51 millions on Buffon a fucking goalkeeper or Real Madrid spending 75 million on Zidane in 2001 wasn't fucking up the market already."

Biden's first move in January should have been quietly getting American civilians out of Afghanistan...either that or immediately postpone any further reduction in our military forces there until after 2021.  The American press is bending over backwards to avoid this conclusion.  The international press is stating it because it's obvious.  It's the pentagon's responsibility to get soldiers out safely but it's nobody but the US president's responsibility to get civilians out safely knowing the timetable he intends to speed up or delay.  Biden was not obligated to do anything Trump announced.
"Ok hear me out before you bombard me with downvotes when I tell you I‚Äôm a center-left liberal.

In the area that I live (Bay Area), many of us ‚Äúlibtards‚Äù believe in democratic socialism. Has nothing to do with communism and has nothing to do with how Lenin and Stalin ran the Soviet Union. We strongly believe in the benefits of capitalism. And a ***social democracy can co-exist with capitalism!!***  All we ask is that we socialize the basic needs for humans - mainly healthcare. Yes, I understand healthcare companies may lose a lot if that happens, so why not come to some sort of a compromise? If you conservatives are open for an open discussion without just throwing insults, I am ready for continuing this conversation. If you have nothing but insults, then just ignore this comment. 
Thanks and love,
A Liberal that wants to understand Conservatives

PS this divide and fight for power is hindering our growth as a country so much. I really hope we can come to some sort of an understanding some time in the future."

"If he has good options with actual offers on the table he would have left already, it's not like Barca is in a position of denying money for an 18-year-old who is good but not currently a crucial part of the team (who is also not looking to be a part of the team at all). 

He probably wants to leave for free, and hasn't done enough to justify playing him despite that. His alleged demands are basically a 'fuck off I'm not renewing' move."
You mean the formation we played in our CL run?
"Somehow the media seems to be painting the picture that Taliban has become more moderate probably with the notion that they managed to sit at a negotiating table with the US but I have no reason to believe that this is true. The reports coming in from Afghanistan are now showing that they have basically improved their media image this time but are still oppressive especially in the way things are in regions and cities other than Kabul (which still has some foreign media left). 

It is going to be disastrous."
I still don't get how people think Luffy ain't garps real grandson when they so clearly look alike. Even at water seven they had the same facial structure.
You really think the media is going to even slightly hint at a single ounce of criticism towards the first female president ever? She could be even worse than Woodrow Wilson and they would still talk about how amazingly stylish her outfits are.

"It has everything to do with it, proven and effective vaccines are fine. New one that doesnt even show great promise or effectiveness isn't worth terminating people and forcing on staff. She has already accepted that if she gets fired she gets fired. It's an issue of someone who worked the covid floor for the last year and willingly helped people and saved lives and never even contracted covid the whole time, losing their job because companies want to jump on a band wagon for no practical reason. Flu vaccine, which performs the same thing as the covid vaccine, was never mandatory, thats not even new. It's just the science says these kinds of viruses can't be prevented no matter what, just boost immune system and lessen symptoms with annual vaccines."
"I'll definitely confirm it but my first reply is true, I have seen people myself get permanently expelled in 1-2 days"
Man. And to think these people think Trump was bad. This will have a huge lasting impact for America. It‚Äôs not that we left (since liberals love using that). It‚Äôs the process and competence in which it was carried out. How can you ignore that? And you act like you care. It infuriates me.

"1) It's an aesthetic but most of it is arbitrary and it looks like the generic good future from Simcity 2013. Why is glass actually more socialist than concrete? Community gardens sound nice but again it's not an entire future so much as a meme. We don't need solarpunk if we need a good vision of the future (I think critiques are more valuable anyway because depicting a future just ends with me saying anarchist versions are dumb and anarchists saying my version is atrocious).

2) Tech needs to be understood by the left as much more than just ""use it for good or use it for bad,"" because it's not just a tool. It's an infrastructure and fabric that is developed over time and molded into something qualitatively different than it would be under a different system, in addition to how it slots directly into capitalist power. The Luddites show how even if something could be used better under socialism is still can be a weapon of capital and sabotage and machine breaking are necessary and good."

"Real question. When one of the vaccines gets FDA approval probably later this year will that be enough to convince you to take it? Vaccine hesitancy is understandable but long term side effects of vaccines are exceedingly rare and we have yet to see statistically significant problems with short term side effects. 

Hospitals that are dealing with covid are now almost exclusively dealing with patients who have not taken the vaccine. They are then forced to administer other treatments that have also had to be approved for emergency use. Is that better?

I think the problem is that there IS already overwhelming evidence and ignoring it is not a great take. Meanwhile there are people that legitimately cannot get the vaccine due to existing health conditions. These people are often the same ones at high risk for covid. 

I think they are saying you are selfish for prioritizing your own fear of the vaccine over the abillity for people who don't actually get a choice to be able to go out and live a normalish life as with so many unvaccinated people out and covid numbers being where they are it is highly unsafe for them whereas if everybody got on board it would let these people have a real freedom to go out and about with their lives without a highly contagious and much more deadly for them disease floating about.

It also could be construed as selfish I suppose when you consider some of these hospital staff who just got through one period of overwhelming work to be followed now by whatever the hell wave we are currently experiencing. 

I am not really on board for shaming people like that. People who choose to not get the vaccine are not doing in to spite the nurses and immune compromised people(at least I hope not lol). They are doing it because they don't feel safe. I think their fear is completely misplaced but I understand why they feel that way. 

 I am, however, not going to pretend like we don't have answers to most of the reason people say they don't want a vaccine. I'm not going to pretend like it's a well  informed choice to refuse the vaccine. It is a misinformed choice."

Hard to say but pissible. I'd say its more of what happens with his infrastructure spending.

If he doesn't pass it then likely we will see the POTUS position change at least  two times in the coming decade because our economy is only going to get worse in the decade.

"1. Pippen may not have been MJ but he still took the Bulls to the playoffs and a 55 win record while MJ was gone. He was a superstar and a premium player. Again, relatively to the era of the Bulls, having a guy like Pippen to play with MJ set the Bulls apart greatly.

2. And again, I'm talking relative to era. No other team in the 90's had the type of star power the Bulls did. I'm saying thats equivalent to how much of an advantage GSW had with KD. I'm not saying its a 1 to 1 comparison, it's relative to the field.

3. They never needed a 3rd option on offense. No team had a premium 3rd option. What they needed was a guy who can strictly focus on defense and doing all the dirty work and Rodman fit that mold perfectly. 

4. I'm not saying they had Grant and Rodman at the same time. I'm saying the Bulls during their reign always had a good flow of great role players, Grant and Rodman being a couple examples."

"> it inflates the market to never seen before levels by external cash injection. A little inflation is good but Man City & PSG have broken the market beyond acceptable levels with unsustainable external funding.

Do you have any source for this statement?

EDIT: Okay, since people would rather downvote me than provide proof, here's some proof that transfer spending in recent years is not in any way inflated ""to never seen before levels"". These are the clubs with the highest net spend in every summer since 2000, adjusted for the inflation in revenue of the top 10 richest clubs (according to Deloitte):

Year | Club | Net spend (million ‚Ç¨)
---|---|----
2000 | Roma | -383,2
2001 | Milan | -419,8
2002 | Manchester United | -156,0
2003 | Chelsea | -567,1
2004 | Chelsea | -462,7
2005 | Chelsea | -148,9
2006 | Real Madrid | -216,0
2007 | Real Madrid | -168,5
2008 | Manchester City | -281,4
2009 | Real Madrid | -348,6
2010 | Manchester City | -273,3
2011 | Paris Saint-Germain | -183,6
2012 | Paris Saint-Germain | -242,4
2013 | Paris Saint-Germain | -165,3
2014 | Manchester United | -194,8
2015 | Manchester City | -169,1
2016 | Manchester City | -191,9
2017 | Manchester City | -236,2
2018 | Liverpool | -137,2
2019 | Real Madrid | -194,5
2020 | Chelsea | -188,4
2021 (so far) | Manchester United | -125,0

In other words, clubs today are spending less money on transfers than they were in the early 2000s."

I don't know what the requirements are for him to make a sacrificial doll, but the ideal way of using his fruit is to make sacrifices of people that the attacker would be hesitant or unwilling to kill in order to get to Hawkins. For example using Kidd as a scapegoat is a great idea and he should do so but maybe with the rest of Kidd's crew or an enemy crew, the main issue is that Hawkins sucks as a fighter :/

But if he can awaken his fruit, boy, I bet he would be impossible to kill if there's anyone alive in his vicinity."

Wealth alone does not determine class. These people got their money by making videos on their computers not through profiting off the wage labour of others.

"Time will tell.

It's not outlandish. Whatever criticisms we can make of the UN, such a level of world government was probably unthinkable to people even 100 years ago (where the leading proposal was the League of Nations, a kind of inter-imperial world government between Allied nations). Let alone 200, 300 years ago. 

I think the key question is more whether socialism can take root and spread in particular nations and achieve some critical mass. Once you have some critical mass, you just take something like the UN and make it more socialist and democratic, and then go from there. Definitely challenging but pretty imaginable all things considered.

It would be critical to make sure that it didn't just become another Comintern, but would be a genuine federation of states with equal rights, and thoroughly democratic root and branch. That would be a battle in its own right.

If the yoke of US imperialism can be thrown off, who knows what is possible."

"Interesting theory. I would love to see Kid awaken his devil fruit. I don‚Äôt think Wano is meant to be his big arc though. Kid intended to take out Shanks. They both have red hair and a scar on the same eye. I think he also lost his left arm fighting the Red Hair pirates which is the same arm Shanks lost saving Luffy. Shanks and Kid have a lot of similarities visually and Kid wanted to take out Shanks out of all the 4 Yonko. I think Kid will really get his moment once Shanks starts playing a bigger role in the story. I guess we will find out once we see more of Kid.

Also, Zoro using fire splitting. That is the first time I heard someone say he‚Äôll use it against King. That needs to happen. It‚Äôs too perfect to not to happen. Good call."

"Seriously? One of the most elite rim protectors and post defenders in the league, great rebounder and finisher, and has progressed into a strong passer from the high post. They run a lot of handoffs and rubs, and he does a good job in that classic Garnett or Horford role where you are reading the defense, looking for cutters or zip passes to the corner for our shooters. He was 6th on the team in terms of assist percentage, only after Smart, Kemba, Tatum, Jaylen and Fournier. 

His per 36 stats were 15 ppg, 13 rpg, 3.4 apg, 1.6 spg and 3.3 bpg, while having some of the best advanced stats on the team. He just needs to stay healthy and show he can play more minutes. I think Nets fans started to appreciate how good he was in that series against them, there were a few games where he impacted the game as much as anyone on the court. He had a positive plus/minus in all the games he played that series despite the fact they lost in 5 and got blown out in most of them."

"It is possible yes. There is a gap in the middle of the standings where it can still be beneficial to lose, but that's still fewer teams that could find tanking beneficial, and it's far from guaranteed they'll actually get anything for it. You can drop yourself out of the playoffs for a #1 pick, but you're just as likely to end up with pick #11. Is it worth it? In theory probably, but you run the risk of really pissing off your fans.

The other thing is tanking is usually more on the office than the team. The players have careers and reputations to play for and usually want to do their best, they just sometimes find ownership has gashed the team of enough quality to win in order to tank.

If a team is an 8 seed, they're a solid and professional basketball team that take the sport seriously, and they have enough quality to win. The office might want the team to lose at that point, but it's too late. They've built a good team of players, and those players are going to want to prove themselves in the playoffs."

"Maybe you should try upping your critical thinking and comprehension. The article, and the resulting comments, are about a hospital shooting itself in it's own foot. We are now finding out that this hospital is just firing nurses for not getting vaccinated. Nurses, I might point out, that stayed and worked every single day during the worst of the pandemic in 2020. And are we going to pretend that this doesn't have anything to do with hospital administrators looking to shave their budgets, maybe hoping for bigger bonuses?

Sounds like a great plan, let's fire perfectly good nurses that were already overworked but at least working, and now load up the remaining nurses with triple the workload, all while crying to the media ""we are drowning in Covid patients"". And you wonder why people are skeptical of ""the science""? It is because of the people in charge, running the show. THEY are the ones not trusted."

Religious exemption. Don‚Äôt remember the exact court case but there is case precedent in New York where legitimate personal spiritual and religious beliefs don‚Äôt necessarily have to line up exactly with any official religious doctrine in order to abstain from mandated vaccinations. You could probably find it with an internet search. I believe It was 2 Jewish parents suing the NY Public school system over vaccine mandates. There was no official Jewish doctrine preventing vaccines so the school tried to expel their children. The court ruled something along the lines of that it‚Äôs not up to the state to interpret religious doctrine and that spiritual beliefs don‚Äôt have to line up with religious dogma anyways in order to be legitimate. The state has no place in judging personal religious and spiritual beliefs of any sort.

The Japanese WWII system had no central war leader, and at this same time this was happening the navy general was pleading that the last reserves of the country go to him to continue fighting and giving the navy a 'glorious death.' These overtures of peace were from people in the Japanese government that didn't represent a majority.

">But now that I'm a socialist, I feel almost liberated from capitalist brainwashing but also struggle with my newfound realization that the US will likely never become what I hope it will in my lifetime

Capitalism is far more unstable than capitalist propaganda would have us believe. At the moment there is no sign in the U.S. that the capitalist class will not increase the pressure on the U.S. workers to revolutionary levels. The question is rather will this pressure be discharged in a fascist or socialist revolution. However, current developments suggest that US Americans will opt for fascism.

What I mean to say is that the future is more uncertain than ever before, and this uncertainty brings with it as many opportunities for us socialists as it does dangers."

"Kawhi Leonard was drafted 15OA with the expectation that he would be a good 3+D in the NBA. Certainly no one expected him to be a top-5 NBA player but everyone expected him to be a defensive stalwart, especially once San Antonio drafted him.

Anyway, that's all to say that I absolutely agree with you on these things being teachable but that's why I'm suggesting it's a lazy comparison. He's got the size of Kawhi and is probably more athletic, but not much else is remotely comparable.

Any one of these prospects could flip a switch and develop BBIQ and defensive acumen. Will they? Likely not. But maybe they will. Even so, I'm not sitting here saying Jalen Johnson or Tre Mann or whoever else is going to be Kawhi Leonard because they have similar height.

I'm sure Kuminga will be a good to great talent. But I feel like the Kawhi comparisons are just sports writers pandering to GSW fans for off-season clicks."

"I'm a conservative and I've seen a little of this.  And yeah, we are outnumbered on reddit.  I don't do Twitter, but from clips I've seen on other sites covering stories that looks to be true there also.

But what bothers me most is the way the conservative movement has been hijacked by the conspiracy theorists.  Being a raving lunatic is not conservatism, and I feel far more outnumbered and shouted down by that lunatic fringe than I do by liberal viewpoints.

Vaccines work.  Masks work.  Not wearing a mask and not infecting others isn't some kind of brave stand for freedom, and it isn't a conservative position.  Conservative = slow change.  Vaccines have been required for decades and are safe.  Rejecting the covid vaccine is not a slow change, it's a knee jerk reaction to a disinformation campaign that conservatives should be smart enough to see past.  I'm old enough that when I was a kid if you didn't have your vaccines you weren't allowed in public school.  I don't know if that's still true today, but refusing to get a covid vaccine is just as stupid as refusing to get a measles or diphtheria vaccine.

Before covid you know who were the only people I saw being anti-vacc?  Liberal actresses/singers/Hollywood types who were stupid enough to fall for some idiot ""vaccines cause autism"" conspiracy.  The type with so much money and free time that they had nothing better do do than follow some idiot conspiracy while day drinking their white wine and planning their next affair.  And I laughed at them!  But now those fools are the minority in the anti-vacc crowd, and conservatives are the ones buying in to this idiocy."

I ended dating a woman who is now my wife, and she was down for Bernie through and through (though she didn‚Äôt label herself a socialist) and helped me understand that you have to think bigger than just what is ‚Äúpractical‚Äù or the status quo. She also opened my eyes to imperialism as she has family still living in South America. 

Fast forward and I became a fan of ‚Äúthe squad,‚Äù saw how Dems did Bernie dirty, especially the second time, and started to listen to people like Michael Brooks (who had a YouTube show before he passed away),Cornel West and Richard Wolf, and started to read some Jacobin and CounterPunch and felt like it opened me up to so many ideas (Marxism, understanding neo-liberalism) that felt like an avenue to the type of world I‚Äôd want to see. 

I‚Äôd say today I just say I‚Äôm a socialist or Marxist. Still always continuing to learn and open to ideas."

When I heard the US secretary of state in India a week ago talking about the situation in Afghanistan and how Taliban is trying to take the country over with force and violence and he said that is not the answer. I remembered that they had been in that same country for 20 years killing hundreds of thousands of people. Literally trying to control the country with violence and mind you all of that was illegal under international law. Hypocrisy doesn't explain the American foreign policy and attitude. It's something totally different. It's not even arrogance. It feels like they believe the rest of the world is stupid and will just take their word for it? I can't figure it out.

"I think it was Nagelsmann that said that he isn't special, he just understands that society and people, therefore players, have changed and that mental health is important (I might be adding to the words he actually said, but this is how I interpreted it). So he will spend time getting to know the players, he will be personal, and he will see that as part of his job.

When I read that interview, he had the utmost respect from me. You do not know anybody's true past, and even if it's spotless with no trauma, etc, you can absolutely wake up one day and be hit with something. You can just be a particular way that requires a little more reassurance, a little more care, attention...

The inverse absolutely exists. You may prefer a more hands off approach. But massive respect to Nagelsmann."

"Both sides of the aisle agreed that we needed to get our of Afghanistan. That is why Trump agreed to leave and Biden did not reverse that decision. The issue everyone has is ***HOW*** we left. The reasons that you point out in favor of us leaving are also agreed on by most people. ***WHY*** we left is perfectly rational and I'm glad Biden decided to go through with leaving. ***HOW*** we left (breaking our agreement, abandoning military installations and equipment, evacuating the military before civilians were evacuated, giving up air control when we need planes to evacuate our people) is why people are blaming Biden. 

All of those decisions are ultimately his to make. He is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. If the intelligence agencies fed him bad information then he should fire them and get better people (he hasn't). If the generals and joint chief of staff did not execute the plan correctly or gave bad advice that led to this disaster then he should fire them and get better people (he hasn't).

> Because it was a different date than discussed under a different admin this means their whole government was to crumble since it was within days

The Afghan government had a nominal force of about 300,000 men. The Taliban a force of about 70,000. They were given over a year to get their shit together and that is if you ignore the fact that the government we supported had been in power since 2004 and should have started preparing to govern the country themselves well before 2020. Shifting the date didn't make the Afghan army weak or unprepared, they did that to themselves through corruption and grift. Shifting the date and breaking the agreement did give the Taliban the green light to stop upholding their end of the deal and start attacking again though.

Maybe if you put down the reefer and try google searching (or clicking on the links I spoonfed you) the agreement, Biden's withdrawal date change, the ANA, etc. you'll be able to make an informed comment and not get ""attacked"" by people correcting you."
"Again, I'm skeptical of upholding idealism and illusion, because of the many stumbling blocks. I believe that it is ultimately counterproductive. 

Let me put it this way: I'm not going to run in an election as a firebrand atheist in a mostly religious country, which even Canada is (and we have a pretty high rate of irreligion). Like, I get that. But I also expect theoretical and political discussion in committed left spaces to understand the role religion plays in orienting people towards a false perception of reality, an idealist one that distracts and numbs.

What I don't understand, in other words, is the resistance to criticism of religion in socialist spaces that identify as following a materialist analysis in the Marxian vein.

Btw, I am not convinced of Christian socialisms' internal consistency, but that is nothing compared to the difficulty one faces in trying to establish widespread Islamic socialism. People have given it a shot, but have routinely faced opposition from clerics, whose correct interpretation of the religious texts and traditions rightly recognizes these socialisms as innovations, and Islam is especially resistant to incorporating innovation. It is a hopeless task. Islam is too legalistic to be open to radical spiritual reform on a mass scale. At most, you can get Sufism, which even when not conservative (and it sometimes is surprisingly conservative) really has no interest in the real world. 

Re the division into eras, I have no interest in following that line. My hope for progress in the Arab world is not that of the Gulf liberals, to become Americans in robes. It is of an Arab world that eschews once and for all the dominance of Islam (and, where it is prominent, Christianity) and embraces a socialist modernity built on a less superstitious approach to reality. This may never, ever happen, but to clarify, that is what my hope is.

Nevertheless, thanks for your engagement, sincerely."
"Oh let‚Äôs just forget US‚Äôs role in fucking up the entire Middle-East, aiding and arming religious extremists for their own power play only to get fucked, leaving and therefore allowing the rise of said extremists religious groups to power, which then led to Middle-East decimated with war, then US ‚Äúintervened‚Äù to bomb and stop the extremists they helped to create as if to save the world, and those extremists that rose led to terrorism against other western nations. 

US is one of the biggest powers to stir up shit, saying ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do it!‚Äù, then coming in for the ‚Äúrescue‚Äù, taking all the credit for ‚Äúsolving‚Äù the very problems they helped to create and making it seem like everyone owes them. Which in return only encourage the fuckers to stir more shit, come to the rescue again, rinse and repeat. 

Not to mention the country that is so much about freedom and greatness is having issues with its own obvious religious and racial extremism in fucking 2021 (you know, a little the same type of extremism similar to the Nazis), a country with human rights violations being rampant in its everyday life, and still pretending like it‚Äôs the chosen land of god and everyone should kiss their ass. 

Every country has flaws but US has made denying responsibility or not willing to admit its severe flaws into a fucking art form."

We could have avoided a summer of bloodshed (and maybe a disastrous Biden presidency), if we didn't have a group of armed people who respond to situations in constant fear that everyone they see is a potential threat.  Fear does, indeed, make people monsters, and cops are, in fact people.

On a related note:  that's why the left is constantly fear-mongering:  they want people to act out of fear rather than reason."
The problem is also his contract. He is not worth his contract for any team that‚Äôs already a contender or feeling comfortable with where they‚Äôre at. I think that‚Äôs the argument being made when people say he only has value to a handful of teams. Obviously any team would want him if they could pay him half his contract but that‚Äôs not a choice. He only has value *at his current contract* for the handful of teams where adding him would be an instant and very significant jump.

">	That's just not true, otherwise you'd see about fifteen teams trying to tank every season. 


Were you not around during the Warriors run? Thats what half the league was doing. They specifically made a rule change to drafting bc it was such an issue.


There‚Äôs some value in what you‚Äôre saying sure. However, thats mosty for teams that have to prove they‚Äôre not a mess. Its mad overrated & a chip is far more lucrative. Bulls consistently made the playoffs after Rose, being that team and it was just pointless.



I have far more excitement for this season than any of those runs because I at least feel like we‚Äôre building something. I guess it depends on if you‚Äôre happy with your favorite team basically being the Pacers or you want your team to take more risks to try to be something great. I wouldn‚Äôt be happy as a Pacers fan because while they‚Äôre consistently solid I want to hopefully celebrate a Chip & I‚Äôd take the risks associated with that. I think many would."

I mean, they had wings, lived on top of the red line and they could create fire, there is no more fitting title than ""celestial dragons"" for such beings.

Also the reason King wears that suit could be because of a certain weakness of his race. Maybe they're weak to water and that's why they lived so far above sea level where even rains rarely occurs.

edit: Also maybe there is a parallelism between King's suit and the nobles' suits and air bubbles. Whereas that race did it out of necessity, the nobles are just trying to mimicking them."

"He has, don't confuse my criticism of him as meaning I'm someone who does not watch his streams. I watch him everyday while I work, I actually enjoy his content. 

He is an entertainer that does politically commentary whose brand is built around Socialism, and such, he needs to larp.

He has identified as a Marxist on stream and Marxism IS revolutionary. There is absolutely no such thing as a non-revolutionary Marxist.

Has Hasan unionized a single workplace?

Does he organize and agitate within his community?

Is he an active member of a Communist party?

Does he urge his audience to engage in any of the above?

The answer to all is a resounding no, and that's because he's not a Marxist or any flavour of Socialist for that matter. He's an entertainer and that's all.

If he doesn't want the backlash then all he needs to do is drop the larp, stop pretending like he's a Socialist when he does absolutely nothing to further the interests of the working class."

When I was in my early teens I was an AnCap/Right-wing Libertarian, I found r/Anarchism and thought it was going to be an AnCap subreddit. When I saw the phrase ""Anarcho-Communist"" I was completely confused, and then went down a studying rabbit-hole to understand what their beliefs were.

After years of studying and research my ideology shifted and became more refined as I became more well-read on history, theory, economics, etc.

For me, the entire process was entirely out of curiosity to understand a position separate from my own, which then shifted to learning about Socialism in general to understand politics better and refine my own views.

So, no point of being scared, but rather, curious."

"Argument about what killed USSR can be endless and there is hardly a single correct answer, it's always a matter of whom you like or dislike, when blaming one character it's always based on whose moustache/lack of it is the worst and so on. 

I can easily say that it was Stalin that ruined USSR by killing (literally) organized opposition and making political sphere very stale, he also didn't bother making a proper leadership change system. All the leaders after him became leaders in a power struggle, making everything a mess in the process. Progressive reforms and ideas of revolution were extinguished by him too (such as legalization of homosexuality, otherwise never done in Empire-USSR-Federation, it was banned back when Stalin got to power). 

But that single answer won't be correct, because leaders after him kept messing up without fixing core issues, therefore they are to blame too."

"I see 2 holes in this theory:

1. The kingdom were Nami originated from is located in the East Blue. Celestial dragons only live in Mary Geoise, anywhere other than that and they're considered stripped of their title. So that rules out the possibility of her being a celestial blood.

2. If she were also royalty then it wouldn't make sense for her to be left unguarded during the conflict to a point were a random toddler Nojiko happens to pick her up off the streets just like that. Although there is a possibility that her protectors died trying to sneak her out the island. But even so, wouldn't Bellemere recognize her as a princess off the bat since they were sent there to protect the Kingdom from the invaders? It doesn't add up.

If anything Nami might be just a regular citizen in that kingdom and like her people got caught in the chaos. Or maybe they were gifted people who are good at navigation much like how Ohara was gifted at archeology. But unlike Ohara who was despised by the WG, maybe Nami's kingdom was seen as a very valuable asset to them which is why they responded to the distress call.

side note: The invaders who raided Nami's island weren't revolutionary armies, they were just probably pirates or a large number of bandits."

However, I find that learning what socialism is first, rather than heading straight into Marx, is a lot better of a way for you to understand what Marx is really saying: For me anyways.  And, of course, you cannot be a socialist if you don't know what capitalism is, which is why I recommend Jacobin's pamphlets I mentioned; great for new socialist just wadding their foot in the water for the first time.

"Interesting, in that sense I agree with you on AD. Serious disagreement on how Jokic is not 1A though. He carried that broken nuggets team all the way past the (actually healthy) blazers. 

I'd probably put Jimmy butler at 1B, except for last year when he had covid he's put teams entirely on his back during the playoffs.

I would probably drop cp3 at least to 1C if not lower, I think the suns wouldn't have won any of the series they did if their opponents were healthy. Cp3 was an important if overstated cog in a deep team. There were a number of times where you could genuinely put him as the third most important player after ayton and book, which imo pushes him down. I think a big part of why they lost to the bucks was actually not playing Cameron Payne enough to just change the pace they played at, because Milwaukee was just too good a defensive team to allow for that slow paced play. They abused his methodical approach and forced him into a number of uncharacteristic turnovers."

"Hi Fujishooter! We do actual organizing too, as we recognize the importance of theory into action. But revolutionary theory is a vital component in building the forces of Marxism, and so it cannot be overlooked.

I can tell you that, even in the last half a year since I joined the IMT, we‚Äôve already presented ourselves as a force within the labor movement. In Toronto, we were the ones who organized the May Day rally, as most of the major labor organizations did not bother given the pandemic.

We also organized as part of Ontario Coalition Against Ford, which called on the NDP leadership to organize mass work refusals to win things like paid sick leave. This got a lot of support from the trade unions.

They also dont know what is in the other medicines they take from that doctor.
Expanding on that do they know all the ingredients of the food they eat?  Probably not, but they still eat.

I am not suggesting everyone has to get the shot.  I just dont understand the logic of trusting a doctor for one thing but not trusting that same doctor for another.  Better skip that tetanus booster.  Better not get those antibiotics.  Should skip that blood pressure med.
I am suggesting that the people who make the choice to not get the vaccine, should respect the choice of suppliers to refuse service to them.

"No hes right. But this is kinda what engels said about labor aristocracy. She is a progressive socially but economically she isnt really one of advocating for revolutionary ideas. Hakim made a great jab and critique at her and hbomberguy although not really saying their names

https://youtu.be/vmJfF5ogJdA

Its left branded capitalism. Heck ill even go to say hasanabi. A streamer i love. But hes getting to be a millionaire. Reacting to shit doesnt help further the cause. He could help fund socialist parties. IMT(international marxist tendancy) the DSA, CPUSA IWW. Thats a critique on the western left on youtube.

Sure video essays help. But when to get to a point of notoriety it comes to a degree on what are you going to do to stop it. And its nothing. Labor aristocracy makes them comfortable. I believe they still want a socialist system but dont really want to use their power to do something bigger at shaking the system. We need the labor aristocrats(high earning proletariats) to help fund the revolution. Richard wolff created democracy at work and economic update. A socialist media to break capitalist demagogy. He also supports the dsa monetarily, funds gravel institute, and teaches at the new school university. Its a very lefty university. And wolff is rich as fuck.

Theres an interesting book im reading. Its called bread tube serves imperialism. I cant find pdfs so you will have to buy the book.

https://www.amazon.com/BreadTube-Serves-Imperialism-Examining-Psuedo-Socialism/dp/B09798771Q

Essentially ppl like thought slime and vaush or other like him like socialism done left or contrapoints or hbomberguy and such still put a eurocentric view on socialism. Socdem or demsoc views and will side with liberal media to condemn the other marxists. ""Oh im not a stalinist what stalin did was bad. Hugo chavez is a dictator, castro made everyone poor.  Afro socialism was a failure. The black panthers were liberals."" All of things vaush has said.

Natalie is a left wing philosophy and uses that as her perspective which is fine. But if you as a labor aristocracy (rich proletarians like a doctor. Or a twitch streamer) dont contribute to revolution or some meaningful way all your videos are just left branded capitalism. Leftism as a brand. You profit off rhetoric without giving something back. And this is what second thought and hakim try to break. They encoirage organization. And like i said about richard wolff he teaches at the new school. A lefty university. And he funds lefty candidates and the dsa and funds gravel insitutue. Something tangible. Nothing big as vanguards but its something.  These big lefty youtubers could do the same."

They are saying that based on the data of this season plus the increase in viewership for the warriors, Steph presents a huge inflate on those number. As the second author points out, even with Lebron the Lakers didn't draw as much local interest as Steph did for the warriors. 

You're taking the conclusion way too literally when all these guys did was point to the data and say that Steph last year was probably the biggest rating draw for the NBA. No one is saying everyone watching a game is solely there for steph...but that he was one of, if not the biggest contributor..."

"Arsenal staking their keeping future in Ramsdale at 23 is indicative of his talent, promise, and character. He is unflappable, a team player, and very commanding vocally which will be key in supporting an extremely young backline.

Arsenal have not had an established long term goalkeeper who was the envy of the world since Jens Lehmann. This is Ramsdale's chance. I think he's going to take it. I was upset when we pulled out of talks for Ramsdale, I thought that was the end. Nay, we got our man."

But regarding weapons: I do not oppose the view that we should arm ourselves, I agree even, especially in countries like the US. I just think we should never ever break the laws of our respective countries while doing so because it will be used as propaganda against us.
Also I think we should only use those weapons in self defense and after the beginning of the revolution.

But, and here all I said before, violence will not help us to convince people that we are the good guys.
We sjould be prepared for violence, but in my opinion it should always be the last resort."

"The economic argument of Marxism, which is supported by real world evidence, is that capitalists can never stay in their corner of the world, because ownership of capital and other stresses within the economic system like competition, inflation and greed necessitate capitalists to own more and more capital over time.

Capitalists don‚Äôt just want or need to make a profit; they are also pressured to GROW those profits CONSTANTLY.

Did this man live in the woods for 30 years? Nearly. But what we see is that no where is really safe; the expansion of capital knows no bounds (another example: imperialism is another form of this expansion).

Another thought; for someone to live off the grid, they must find land that has value and can provide resources to survive; just because someone doesn‚Äôt want to make money off of their land doesn‚Äôt mean they want land with no value.

If living off the grid still requires land to have value, and capitalists are always trying to increase their value, it only follows suit that they will reach into as many places as they can to take this value for themselves."

"It works because they are just changing some aspects of employment, like requiring masks. If you don‚Äôt meet it then you aren‚Äôt meeting the qualifications of the job anymore. There are of course exceptions, such as if the company is changing someone‚Äôs pay or working hours. That is called a constructive dismissal and counts as being fired."

Wish this sub the best. But judging by the silly reactionary takes based on my comment. I'm just going to back away and watch this from a distance.

Because again, this isn't what my state stands on in terms of conservatism. You guys are being laughed at and are looked upon as some weird cult. How is this not recognizable amongst yourselves? Just do some self reflecting while you sit in bed at night and blame a single person on a 20 year war...I mean I can't say it any clearer. I feel dumb just trying to reach some of you guys."

"""Carbon Credits"" ""Long Term Storage Credits"" and every other attempt to monetize environmental impacts are terrible ideas that only serve to continue to enrich the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. How does a carbon credit stop Dupont from mass producing PFAS and PFOA? How do long term storage credits slow down big ag from growing as much GMO corn and dairy and pork for profit as they can?"

"Marx never pretended that the LTV was universally applicable. Its application is in the sphere of commodity production. A near priceless work of art like the Mona Lisa might've taken 16 years to make, but an artist with, say, 80% the level of skill wouldn't be able to make enough art during their whole life to equal that price.

Pointing out edge cases where a theory doesn't work doesn't invalidate the theory more generally. We don't write off Newtonian mechanics because it's inadequate at describing the precession of Mercury."

"Texas Authorization didn't extend outside the State, meaning the Dems could only be arrested IF THEY CAME BACK. A State Judge issued a restraining order on detaining them so that they could come back without being arrested.

Even if that had not been the case, arresting them would have set an uncomfortable precedent, since GOP lawmakers flee from voting too."

"The first thing to understand about the Northites is that they are a cult. Their cult‚Äôs leader is a millionaire union busting publisher. A Quintessential capitalist. The next thing to know about the ICFI is that they don‚Äôt exist IRL. Their only substantial section is in the US. The SEP are literally only like dozens of people. There‚Äôs numerous first hand accounts from former members who detail their experiences with being a cult member. The last thing to understand is that the only thing of substance that they are able to achieve is producing the WSWS. Which is absolute trash. They have been on the wrong side of history so many times that the WSWS is banned from r/socialism & most, if not all, socialist subs.

Part of the problem is that people who don‚Äôt have any real world organizing experience cannot tell the difference between a group who has a large online presence but accomplishes nothing IRL, and actually existing socialist organizations. If you were to mention the WSWS in a meeting of socialists, you would be laughed out of the room. It holds no sway over the movement what so ever"
"in theory, that shouldn't matter. as long as the metrics accurately measure the thing they're being used to measure, it wouldn't matter what other observations could also be made.

let's say the research says eating chips shows mental toughness, drinking beer shows creativity, and getting angry at inanimate objects shows great understanding. in theory, even if drinking beer also requires mental toughness and getting angry require creativity, you'll end up with accurate results about everyone you measure as long as you measure them on each trait.  the question is always just going to be whether those initial assumptions are valid."

"Did you even read what I wrote? I did acknowledge them, and I didn't excuse them either.

I did acknowledge what progress they made however.

Freeing up divorce laws to allow women to leave abusive relationships.

Providing a strong safety net to allow women to take risks in their careers, even if they chose to have children.

Having the highest rates of women/men in medicine and science, a trend that still holds up today.

(And yes, I am aware these are issues that mainly benefited hetero and cis women only) 

You cannot divorce the USSR from it's time and hold it to the standards of today, of course it would fail, literally every nation would have failed. You can only compare it to it's contemporaries, compared to which, it excelled in regards to Women's Rights, even with the hypermasculinity. Again, this doesn't excuse the hypermasculinity or patriarchy, or the failures to address these issues to the fullest extent.

"It may likely be linked to the ""set-up"" of the scene. Oda is usually very good at making sure the action will follow the ""right-to-left"" / ""to-to-bottom"" format. So the action will usually be ""ready to read"" to follow how time passes in the manga from right to left. Here, if we read this way, we see the slash first, and then Zoro, which can mean that the slash ""occured"" first and that Zoro moved away from the slash. IMO it would have been easier to understand if reversed, but it was probably too difficult to set up."

He wants to own his own home because that‚Äôs the only way for secured housing and who wants to live with a landlord who can kick you out without any real notice. LA property prices are insane so these are his choices.
1. he moved to the suburbs and commutes in by car because public transport is bad? ‚ÄúDestroying the climate with his car and suburbs are racist, Adam Ruins Everything said so‚Äù
2. Does the above but buys a Tesla? ‚ÄúOh look at all these clips of you criticising Elon Musk, hypocrite much.‚Äù
3. Moves to an affordable neighbourhood? He would actually be taking affordable housing from those that need it and contributing to gentrification 
4. Buys a slightly less luxurious looking house with less space near LA? Still going to be insanely expensive and people will still do bad faith criticisms 
5. Carries on renting? No secure housing, which sucks wherever you live.

For a family of four, it would be harder if they live in one of those big cities especially if they have to pay rent. You wouldn't be able to save some money most of the times. In most other places you will be able to live a decent life."

Wiz aren‚Äôt trying to compete in the event Beal leaves so I don‚Äôt see the same urgency to get a deal done imo. Especially if it means taking on 30+ million in salaries for players they don‚Äôt want. Maybe 2 firsts is a nice sweetener but if it‚Äôs Celtics picks then you can assume it will be 24-30

Holy shit I didn't realize it was that late. That's really depressing.
Barca had a history of vilifying players that don‚Äôt conform to the Barca line so this isn‚Äôt surprising. If they can sacrifice an 18 year old to keep other players in line it will be worth it for them.
"He‚Äôs a pirate people in the comments like what a bitch, coward, he‚Äôs lame, etc and I‚Äôm like he has a power that can connect his life to others kinda makes sense for him to connect his life to his enemy shit that‚Äôs what I would do if I had his power."
"And that last part is also exactly why he isnt trading Simmons for Brogdon and a first. One could maybe talk themselves into trading an All-NBA player for Simmons (All-NBA in 2020, DPOY candidate, could maybe fix him etc), but that isnt the case for Brogdon who doesnt have Ben's holes in his game, but he is older and the ceiling of his trade value isnt as high as Ben's.

The issue however is that there probably have been internal clashes between Simmons' camp and Doc, Morey and/or Joel (unless Ben really reacted *this* extremely to a couple post-game comments by Doc and Joel and has zero self-reflection). That fallout kind of makes it impossible to run it back (even if the roster has taken another step with Thybulle, Maxey and Milton all improving and Niang being an upgrade over Scott) which means Morey is dealing with a bad hand this offseason. As a Sixers fan, I really hope his bluff works out soon, as I am pretty scared of the return for Ben if it doesnt work out."

"For grammar and vocab get text books, like the genki textbooks or the situational functional Japanese text books, and for kanji focus on the Jouyou kanji (they're the only kanji taught in schools and the only kanji newspapers can use). I find the kanji tree and kanji study apps are good kanji studying tools. There's also wanikani which I've heard is good for studying kanji as well. Find websites where you can talk to Japanese speakers and ask them questions and talk to them. There are some websites dedicated specifically to this sort of thing. 

Learn about Japanese culture and history because that helps a lot with figuring out idioms and references. Try to watch stuff without subs and translate it as you go, then check the subs for how well you did. Don't just watch anime, watch live action stuff too, because live action tends to have more realistic spoken Japanese. If you can watch stuff that's unscripted that's helpful too. Also try to read and translate written Japanese. The learn Japanese subreddit should have recommended books for different levels of fluency. For that matter, check out the learnJapanese subreddit, they'll have lots of pointers for overcoming plateaus. If you can actually visit Japan at any point, then absolutely do that, because immersion is super helpful for learning a language. If not see if any places in your area have a conversation cafe type setup where language learners can speak directly with native speakers. 

A big thing to consider is when you feel like you're plateauing, before you start trying to figure out what the ""next thing"" to do is, make sure you perfect and practice what you already know, because if you try to move on too quickly because you feel like you've figured it out then that in itself can be what caused that feeling of plateauing because you're not proficient enough to move forward yet.

Above all else, just keep working at it consistently and over time you'll make progress!"

"MJ was my favorite player growing up, and perhaps favorite of all time. Believe he's arguably the greatest, but two things ... 

1. There are few players that could potentially or would beat him one-on-one. It would not be a piece of cake at all to go through a long list of these players.

2. If I had to pick #1 player overall for a team, historically. I'd actually consider a few centers and more versatile wings over him. It's not slam dunk pick. The Bulls were pretty mediocre for the first part of MJ's career. That alone tells you that you would need other pieces around him."

"I didn't say they couldn't fire someone for reasonable and legal reasons, so I don't know what your point is.  

They have the right to terminate the employees for any legal reason, but there are some reasons that would cause the employer to have to pay unemployment. If it is legal for the employer to demand they have the vaccine, and the employee refuses, then that is cause for termination, and no unemployment, so the theory goes.  

If it isn't reasonable/legal for the employer to demand vaccination, but still terminates the employee, then the termination is most likely still legal, but they would be on the hook for unemployment."

"While I‚Äôm personally not a big fan of it, I don‚Äôt vehemently oppose a government, especially one that maintains freedoms and equality and essentially abolishes class, but the state is a different story. No matter how compassionate one may seem, the state exists to maintain itself, usually through any means necessary, which is why I believe caution must be taken when establishing a socialist state, and even then, there are risks."

"> I just looked it up, and apparently people fired for cause are also ineligible for unemployment benefits. So even if this is not qualified as quitting, it definitely can be qualified as being fired for-cause. The for-cause rules are very strict but I imagine this would apply.

It would depend on how their contracts were written, I'd imagine. If you're capable of fulfilling every duty laid out by your employment contract, I don't know that they can add new ones (like getting vaccinated) then claim they're firing you for-cause because you fail to meet newly added requirements. It would just be a pretty abusable loophole."

"Don't forget that his crew was legendary too, Rayleigh alone is a pretty massive beast. The Rayleigh we saw at Sabaody hadn't fought in 20 freaking years, and freaking Kizaru himself said ""we aren't prepared to take you here""... A freaking admiral admitted he couldn't apprehend Rayleigh without further preparations, while casually oneshotting Supernovas. 

People like to point to the fact that Rayleigh showed even the slightest bit of exertion (""he was sweating bruh"") but keep forgetting that he was an old as fuck past his prime guy who hadn't fought in 20 years. I am sure he is gonna need to get warmed up at least **while singlehandedly holding off the Marines' highest ranking, most powerful martial force**. In his prime he was probably easily above Admiral level. 

Plus we have not even gotten to see what Scopper Gaban was capable of, he has conspicuously been absent from present events but we know he's alive and out there somewhere, and he was the third guy always shown from Roger's crew but we know nothing about him. 

However we do know that when Oden was charging Roger, both Rayleigh and Scopper stepped up first before Roger stopped them and fought Oden himself."

"If i remember correctly, conqueror's haki is all about having the will/determination to be superior to others. As they say in the anime, ""qualities of a conqueror"" and not necessarily king like status. So stuff relating to him being royalty doesn't make for a good argument. Also what Sanji has been doing so far like: getting former enemies to have a change of heart, inspiring/helping others, wanting to be the best cook, are all just good qualities and don't necessarily count as that of a conqueror. Cuz the thing is the word ""conqueror"" in one piece is more so of a competitive/dominating nature than just pure king-like characteristics imo. If it were the latter then wouldn't all royal blood, leaders, big dreamers have it then or atleast have the potential? And lastly fighting prowess also doesn't make a good argument. Just because someone is strong/will become one of the strongest doesn't mean they are automatically fit for coc. 

So yeah, I don't think Sanji is gonna manifest a coc or even Oda going for that route.

ps: Not a Sanji hater, far from it actually. He is one of my top favorites in One Piece. I'm not also doing this to pit him against Zoro or anything of that sort. I'm just narrating the facts that were shown to us so far and this is what it concluded to."

You HAVE to be trying to fuck things up so badly.
‚ÄúAccidents‚Äù can be complex and catastrophic, (airplane crash investigations) but you cannot, it‚Äôs absolutely impossible, to accidentally, oopsie daisy destroy economies and centuries of rights/freedoms.

"I am deeply convinced that Putin is among the worst politicians in the world by now and I dream of his downfall, along with his oligarchs, enforcers and propagandists. The only ""good"" thing about him is that he isn't as strong as some people think, his regime is rather fragile. As I was born in 2000, ""Putin"" was also the second word I ever said, right after ""Mum"", it's depressing. He was arguably alright first few years (well not really, but maybe could've been worse), but by now he is an uncharismatic old dictator that is obsessed with power and wealth, maybe he always was. Struggling against Putin in a democratic crusade is what's making Russian politics somewhat interesting and makes me feel not that embarassed when I look at active political life in other countries.

CPRF is lame, but as I've said somewhere else under this post there are some good politicians and it's a very big organization that will spearhead opposition in upcoming elections. Liberals are branded extremists and foreign agents (which gives them some strenghts in other fields actually), so many of them won't be able to become legal opposition, despite otherwise being stronger than socialists-communists I guess. Putin's party popularity is around 17% now, so it's a unique chance to deal them damage.

I love non-centralized political systems, if I were a president of Russia, I would've given far more power to local democratically elected structures instead of making them completely obey Moscow. I think it's called ""localism"", but that word isn't commonly used."
"Marxism is about trying to remove that elite layer. Lenin in State and Revolution demands the destruction of the entire state machinery. No police, no standing army, and no bureaucrats. Inevitably, some form of state is required, but that state is to be applied through a series of democratically elected, recallable representatives through workers' councils.

The case of the USSR was an interesting one, and should be studied carefully to avoid repeating its mistakes. As you rightly mention, a bureaucratic layer arose which was similarly hoarding and oppressive. [A good article is this one](https://www.bolshevik.info/russia-how-the-bureaucracy-seized-power-part-one-the-russian-working-class-takes-power.htm) which explains the factors that led to it, and the fight of the left-opposition against it."

"[The Revolution Will Not Be Televised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF_5xZIstPw) is a documentary made by a film crew that happened to be in Venezuela when the 2002 coup happened and the subsequent revolution to overturn the coup. Especially if the current state of Venezuela seems somewhat confusing, this documentary highlights the revolutionary potential of the movement behind Chavez.

[Greece on the Brink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwJMFsr8tZM) is a well done documentary done by folks in the IMT during the rise of SYRIZA. It goes over the effects of the 2008 financial crisis and the uptick in working class struggle. It is a little outdated since it was made before SYRIZA really took power and betrayed the movement, but many of the people speaking, do essentially paint that as the most likely outcome which shows how much of a handle the filmmakers had on the situation.

I don't have a link, but recently banned from the Labour Party, Ken Loach, did a documentary a couple years ago called ""The Spirit of '45"". This documents the general social elan in the UK following the defeat of the Nazis and the sweeping into power of the Atlee government. It also covers many of the gains won by the Labour Party, like nationalizing the railroads, creating the NHS, building homes, etc."

yeah thats up for debate right now and will definitely end up in court relatively soon. its well within a companies right to require vaccinations for public health reasons. particularly since the vaccines now have full FDA approval
The only wars that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union were in the Caucasus and they were relatively small affairs. Compare it to the collapse of pretty much any other major empire it was about as peaceful as it gets. There was some revolutionary violence in Moscow and Romania but nothing on the scale of a war.

Confirmation bias is a hard thing to avoid but when the vast majority of these scientists, medical professionals and scientific organizations say one thing and that handful of people say the other. At what point do you trust the larger group of professionals.

"I lived in the planet outside Catalu√±a and Barca fanboys, I guess.

All of which had their particular allure, but that even if all tastes are subjective, most people indeed agreed on that -bar Catenaccio- were all more entertaining that Pep's Tikitaka.

>Weeks before the first bomb was dropped, on July 13, 1945, Japan had sent a telegram to the Soviet Union expressing its desire to surrender and end the war. The United States had broken Japan‚Äôs codes and read the telegram. Truman referred in his diary to ‚Äúthe telegram from J*p Emperor asking for peace.‚Äù President Truman had been informed through Swiss and Portuguese channels of Japanese peace overtures as early as three months before Hiroshima. Japan objected only to surrendering unconditionally and giving up its emperor, but the United States insisted on those terms until after the bombs fell, at which point it allowed Japan to keep its emperor. So, the desire to drop the bombs may have lengthened the war. The bombs did not shorten the war.

The US dropped the bombs because they didn't want the USSR to gain influence in Japan."

Garnett was a more dominant defender than Giannis in his era. He might have even had more versatility than Giannis. You don't really know what you're talking about. He was a significantly better playmaker and passer.  Garnetts probably as good as Duncan and absolutely better than Dirk. It's also not exactly fair to compare eras either. The pace is faster now and there's so much more spacing. The game is so perimeter oriented that big men have more mismatches offensively too. Look at the defensive lineups Garnett and Malone had to face VS what Giannis faces. It's tough to compare players. It's best to look at how they dominated relative to their eras. Giannis still doesn't have the longevity of those guys.

"False consciousness is a type of irrationality, though. 

I have training in analytic philosophy and have a pretty old-fashioned trust in logic and reason and so on. I later did an MA in English (effectively in critical theory and continental philosophy) and spent quite some time trying to insist to those around me that I wasn't ""fundamentally misguided"" in my attachment to analytic philosophy and that the two approaches could learn much from one another. I still think that a great deal of critical theory and continental philosophy is absolute rubbish (as is most Anglo-American philosophy, no doubt, but that tradition lacks the big-name charlatans of the continent), but what I think is good more than withstands a rigorous, critical, and analytical perspective. 

And the debatebros aren't particularly rational. They just like to rant about using facts and logic, but do nothing but appeal to fallacy and personal attack when faced with something they have no answer to."

Works hard academically and does stuff extracurricularly but never has to worry about the sanctity of their life/stuff that‚Äôs outside of their control.

The premise is that since we‚Äôve guaranteed ‚Äúequality of opportunity‚Äù, both students theoretically have the same shot at getting into Harvard. Anyone with two brain cells, however, can quickly understand that this assumption carries no weightage of the environmental, social, and biological factors that both individuals are exposed to in order to realize the American Dream/those aspirations.

I didn't even know about his bigoted past, I just thought someone who's Gon bankrupt multiple times and not a politician would be a horrible president. so I slowly transitioned from Ben Shapiro SJW owned, to Trumps racist past. I was still very anti-socialism and anti-Bernie. then about half way through 2017 I started listening to things he said, learned about how European countries are ranked higher in everything like education and happiness. and that eventually evolved into watching Hasanabi, and during the 2020 election I watched him heavy, then I started reading a little theory and now watching Vaush's debates. very proud of my growth out of brainless, repeated talking points"

"Are the wealthy socialists responsible for capitalism? If they aren't capitalists and exploit workers, then I don't care how much money they have on their bank accounts. And if you are born rich, it is not your choice. Sure everybody with extra money should use it to promote worker's rights.

And there are currently always people more rich and more poor than us. If you live in developed world and are part of the bourgeoisie, you are many times richer than the worker in Bangladesh who makes you shirts. Does that make you a bad socialist? Not in my opinion.

The problem is always the system, not the individuals."

"Not so much scared as apprehensive. I'm from the U.S so I've been pumped with propaganda since birth. Similar to faith no matter how much I understand I can never get it out of the back of my head. 

No matter how much I know about socialist figures I still feel some sort of guilt admiring the writings of people like Lenin or Guevara. These men were portrayed as no better than an ISIS commando since I was a child. Like my old faith, where no matter how obvious the lack of evidence for the gof I believed in, I'll always have that little voice in my head telling me somethings a sin. 

Eventually you learn to stop being afraid of yourself. At that point controlling impulses and breaking dogma becomes a lot easier I think. 

I'm more scared of what may happen if I'm active during the time leftists get too big for the taste of the establishment. My government is not above terror, assassination, torture, kidnapping, threats to family, etc. Not at all. 

And honestly that fear gets me sometimes. But why should I be allowed to feel safe while the victims of my countries imperialism suffer in abject fear? I think I'd rather feel fear than cause it. But that may be easier said than done."

With Ramsdale coming in, I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôre banking on him taking the #1 spot from Leno (which will probably after this season). I think they overspent on White but I think once Gabriel and Partey are back from injury, the defense will look a bit more tight. With  √òdegaard back and Bellerin looking to be sold soon, I think they‚Äôve addressed the majority of the issues regarding positions needing to be filled long term. I‚Äôm hoping they pan out, but the good news is that they‚Äôre young which means if they don‚Äôt work out as well as we‚Äôd like, they can still be sold for a decent fee rather than running out their contract and getting nothing for them like they have been with the older players that Arsenal have been signing as stop gaps."

"> *I feel like when some people listen and understand what socialism and communism is about they will choose that future.*

When former President Obama was promoting healthcare reform between 2008 - 2010, he faced intense backlash. To me, the most absurd were the 65+ year old Medicare-eligible people who carried signs saying‚ÄîI'm not exaggerating‚Äî""**KEEP THE GOVERNMENT'S HANDS OFF MY MEDICARE!**""

> *This country has been doing everything in it's power to shit on communism every chance it gets.*

This statement is very true. I remember watching a propaganda film in my 1st grade class that compared Russia and the USA. The film contrasted communism and capitalism and was very explicit about how capitalism was superior in every way to communism. From at least 1st grade through 9th grade, I remember being taught every year about the superiority of ""free enterprise"" and ""capitalism.""

> *They claimed straight lies like ""the Nazis were socialist"" and ""Stalin killed more than Hitler"". If your mind was taught for 30, 40, 50+ years that ""communism bad"" it's hard to break the mold.*

I agree.

> *These people aren't lazy, they are just not listening.*

I don't know if I agree or disagree with this statement. At the very least, confronting one's deeply held belief system and accepting that something you've believed all your life was wrong is very difficult to do."
"It's they hypocrisy that is being called out. Also, if you have looked at covid numbers, this is the same case everywhere. The media doesn't provide any context. ER's overwhelmed!!!! We're at 80% capacity what do we do!!!!! Um, ER's always run at near 100% capacity. It's way too wasteful and expensive to create capacity that is never used. Also, when a hospital is ""overwhelmed"" they mean the same thing. It's like 20 people showing up.

Also, I'm not at all interested in hearing about any hospital being overwhelmed 18 months in to 2 weeks to flatten the curve so we can build up resources.

edit: and remember, this was going on when Sturgis was going on too. Lord Fauci went on TV to say Sturgis was going to kill the universe but never mentioned Barry's party. Weird. What made it so (D)ifferent?"

"I'm sorry but this is complete revisionism and contrariness. Yes, some people would grow tired of Barcelona after a few years of dominance, but when they won the Champions League in 2009 people were effusive in their praise for them. The whole Guardiola vs Mourinho narrative was based around Guardiola playing beautiful football and Mourinho playing pragmatic football.

I mean here's what Four Four Two said about them:

>[In 50 years‚Äô time, when most of us will be eating through a straw, we can die happy that we saw one of the greatest sides ever performing at the apogee of their celestial talent. In introducing tiki-taka ‚Äì originally intended as an insult ‚Äì to the footballing lexicon, Bar√ßa re-wrote the beautiful game‚Äôs playbook in their own, perfectly formed 4-3-3 image.](https://www.fourfourtwo.com/gallery/50-best-football-teams-of-all-time)

Here's what David Winner, writer of Brilliant Orange about the development of Dutch football, said when Guardiola stepped down at Barcelona:

>[he learned the game from its Dutch source and took tiki-taka ‚Äì or ""total football"" ‚Äì to new levels of perfection. The numinous football Bar√ßa played in his time was inspirational, and his sudden loss to football ‚Äì after successive defeats to Chelsea in the Champions League and bitter rivals Real Madrid in the Spanish league ‚Äì is a cause for grief.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/29/barcelona-gospel-of-guardiola)

And here's what Richard Williams of the Guardian wrote when he left Barcelona:

>[Modest and dignified, his departure typified a man whose labours helped the club he loves to accumulate millions of admirers around the world. Johan Cruyff laid the foundations and Frank Rijkaard embellished the superstructure, but it was during Guardiola's time that the work reached fruition.](https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/apr/27/pep-guardiola-barcelona-father-figure)

Here's a quote from a Sid Lowe column, just a few months into Guardiola's first season at Barcelona:

>[Suddenly the Catalan press that complained at losing Jos√© Mourinho is falling over itself to proclaim the ""Pep Team"" - ""Pep's Dream Boys"" was that little bit too ridiculous, even for them - the greatest thing in the whole wide world ever. Even the Madrid press is impressed, Marca's Miguel Serrano declaring: ""If I was a kid now, my dad would have a hell of a job stopping me supporting Barcelona. The Pep Team's too late because you can change house, job, wife, political party and even your sex, but not your football team, yet when they play it's glorious.""](https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2008/nov/03/barcelona-laligafootball)

So the idea that Barcelona under Guardiola were never called beautiful is just flat out incorrect.

And looking up Klopp's quote in context is very different to how you presented it, he's not saying Barcelona weren't beautiful, he's saying he doesn't like to play beautiful football:

>[Klopp went on to explain that what he likes is ""fighting football, not serenity football; rainy day, heavy pitch, everybody has a dirty face and then they go home and can't play football for the next four weeks. That's what Borussia are all about"", he stated.](https://www.marca.com/2013/11/04/en/football/barcelona/1383581274.html)"
It's only free speech when you agree with conservative talking points. If you disagree it's not free speech anymore.
"Why not? They got a player of Partey's calibre last summer. Having the money and being in London is more than enough to get great players, let alone being a club of Arsenal's overall prestige

They could definitely sign someone like Aouar for example. It doesn't need to be someone from a top club or anything but basically the same types of signings Liverpool made in the first few years under Klopp (Salah, Fabinho etc type of signings)"

"He's in a no-win situation - but make no mistake he was the one who got into it. Trump's plan was to have a light footprint, force the Taliban and Ghani to work together, and to bomb the heck out of the Taliban if they tried to pull a fast one. 

Trump had credibility because he had done stuff like that before, without caring for any niceties (for example when he spaghettied Iran's top general, Soleimani). Not a great situation, but this way the Afghans who were US allies would remain with some safety in Afghanistan. 

Biden did not care about what was happening in the ground, did not react when things went horribly against the plan - like when the Taliban started assassinating pilots a couple of months ago, and worst of all, did a bunch of puzzling, WTF is going on moves such as - bolstering Pakistan (which made it clear which way the war was going to end), abandoning the Bagram air base when tons of US people were still in the country, removing the military before civilians, removing the contractors who were the ones keeping the Afghan Air force's logistics going (which crippled the air force, and the entire way of fighting that the US had taught the Afghan Army). 

So the US has limited leverage right now in controlling events."

">Hearing our fans call Saliba a ‚Äúweak mentality player‚Äù for joining Marseille in Europa over Steve Bruce despite wanting to stay at Arsenal, and then get excited over Odegaard who‚Äôs giving up on fighting for his spot despite his competition being 36 year olds in midfield is quite funny to be honest.

No, we don't.

I've literally never seen anyone call Saliba a ‚Äúweak mentality player‚Äù at all, what are you on about?

The criticism of him has been because the club clearly wants him to experience Premier League football, so when the chance to join a Premier League club came and he decided to return to France, he was rightly questioned on it.

No one thinks he has a weak mentality at all."

I agree though, their state definitely has some admirable and novel qualities."

"The 73 win team had a far better version of both Iggy and Draymond(i.e. it was the year Draymond could actually score and shoot threes and Iggy was still a regular contributor and amazing on defense).

Andrew Bogut and Barnes were massive for that team too and Livingston/Barbosa/Speights. That only team, top to bottom, was great in their rotation which is how they won 73 games. It wasn't just a top heavy super team like what you see with Lebron teams, it was a quality all around team."
"The argument that 'people are overworked' ignores the situations which happened in the 19th centuries. That was when literal wars were fought with employers over the 8 hour day.

Certainly, it's harder for US citizens than it is in many other countries, but the BLM protests had *10% of the US population*. Activision-Blizzard, in an industry without a union, recently staged multiple walk-outs and forced the top brass to resign. There was recently a vicious fight in *Amazon* for unionisation, where all of the issues you mentioned are even more pronounced.

Pretending that 'things will stay the same until the population gets more pissed off (an accelerationist perspective) just doesn't line up with reality."

"Only another reason to hand programs and spending to the states.

The states can decide their own income tax rates and what social programs (if any) they want to fund from their own taxpayers. We're incentivizing the absence of work at the federal level, and it's unfair to people who actually contribute.

Let the states who institute poor planning and programs suffer and the ones who promote and incentivize work and less social programs succeed.

Under the current system, the federal government holds everyone hostage to their own desires. Defund them massively. The Federal government only needs to fund the military."

There was much less debt, far fewer people dependent on the government, there was more respect for the Constitution back then.

Even if he doesn't work out, Arsenal could easily sell him for 10-15m to a mid-table club and they wouldn't have paid any of the add-ons. But I suspect, at worst, he'll be backup/cup keeper for the next decade at Arsenal unless they end up with a really good young keeper coming coming up through the academy. And 24m spread across a decade is nothing for any PL club, let alone one of the big teams."

Also correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but you probably were born well after the fall of communism? So everything you know about it is secondhand from friends or family who were alive then.

">I'm gonna line up 10 random people, but one of those people are capable of killing you without losing a minute's sleep that night. And you're to approach five of them. If I advised you not to exaggerate the dangers, how would you react to that advice?

I would tell you that you're exaggerating the number of people ""capable of killing you without losing a minute's sleep that night' by several orders of magnitude.  That's not even close to being true among *combat soldiers*, much less random people walking down the street.

The fact is that [being a cop is not particularly dangerous](https://advisorsmith.com/data/most-dangerous-jobs/).  In fact, it's not even in the top 20 most dangerous job categories in the US, and even that includes stuff like overweight cops having heart attacks at their desks, and traffic accidents.  ""[Death by bad guy](https://www.dailyinfographic.com/see-the-leading-causes-of-death-for-u-s-police-officers)"" accounts for about 1/3 of the already-small number of cop deaths, and even that assumes that the person who killed the cop was not *himself* justified in doing so.

So the next time your trainer shows you a one-on-a-hundred-million video clip of a cop being gunned down by an 80-year-old dementia patient, remind him that he put you in more danger of dying in a traffic accident by making you drive to the station to watch it.  Simply put, the guy who mows the lawn in front of the police station where you work is more likely to die on the job than you are... and if you only consider deaths caused by acts of violence, *he is three times more likely to die in a lawn care accident than you are to be killed by a bad guy*.

I'm not suggesting that cops dying from violence (although statistically extremely rare) is not tragic.  I want to point out that sending armed people with very loose rules of engagement into fluid situations with a *vastly exaggerated sense of danger* has a cost... and that cost is *also* measured in unnecessary lives lost when cops overreact because their level of fear is wildly disproportionate to the level of danger.

So let me turn your example around:  let's say of the 30-or-so local and county cops in my town on any given day, 10% of them are capable of killing me without losing a minute of sleep.  I'm likely to come into proximity with one or more of them dozens of times over the course of the year as we go about our lives.  Should *I* be worried?  For every ""cop gets ambushed"" video you have I can show you a dozen ""cop overreacts"" videos.  What color line should I put on *my* flag to represent the danger of exposing myself to such danger?"

Does that not at least start to raise questions of where your interests or class goals start to lie? I wouldn‚Äôt hold it against him personally, but it makes me question his motives and his personal ideals. Socialism isn‚Äôt everyone becomes immediately poor, its to raise the standard of living and break down the socio economic/ class barriers of the hegemonic society we live in. I know that‚Äôs what California goes for at this point and $3M is a drop in the bucket, but was there nothing else? It depends on the relations we have to these people. If he‚Äôs just a social democrat arguing for co-ops, better wages, and health care fine. But I will not say he‚Äôs for inherently proletarian politics if he himself chooses such excess. If $3M is something he could afford he could certainly create means of legitimate organization through such means. How many copies of State and Rev could he distribute freely to an organization? How many tee shirts, food, medical supplies could he help distribute to the homeless for such an amount. He will make more through his streaming regardless, but lets not hold these people up on these pedestals. No gods no masters."

"Let‚Äôs answer this:
Aarlong - without Haki, Aarlong is probably one shot now. Let‚Äôs give him some Armament Haki so he can do pierce attacks. I believe Luffy dodges his attacks with Observation and then splat.
Enel - enel would suffer the most from Luffys observation Haki. His Rubber fruit auto tanks to its no contest.
Oars- I still believe Oars in straight power battle would be better. But, Luffy can probably take him on in second gear. If he uses Conqueror coated red roc, it‚Äôs over then and there. The problem would be the trash units. If conq burst does not take them down there might be some contest there. 
Doffy - doffy would still be a problem. It‚Äôs mostly because of his df being able to control others. I‚Äôm sure doffy would not directly challenge Luffy 1 on 1. Rather he would plot and get ussop or Nami stuck in his strings and attack Luffy alongside him. He will uses them as defence whilst attacking around and in extreme cases through them. He would still need laws help to get his friends out before taking out doffy.
Katakuri - it‚Äôs a tossup. The added strength counts for nothing against him as he will just dodge them. It‚Äôll probably be another round of snakeman attack with a war of attrition. I think Luffy got a bit weaker compared to Katakuri. If he is now coating his punches with coc, he is spending more energy in each attack which I believe Katakuri can still dodge. So, it‚Äôs likely that Luffy runs out of gas trying to overdo missed attacks. Best course of action would be to make Katakuri attack has positive beefy trades."

But multiply that over a week, then over a month, it's only P20000. You need at least P25-30,000 a month to live a *comfortable life* in the city as a single person.

And I mean comfortable in a very gracious manner. As in, you have stable internet, good housing (studio apartment in a good-enough neighborhood), just enough food, and *maybe -* just *maybe* \- an air conditioner for the godforsaken heat, and no debt. *Very very* minimal luxuries like traveling.

What more for families with four to five children?"
"> I get a refund almost every year like 50% the country does.

that doesn't mean anything.

lets say your tax burden is $1000 for the year, and look at 2 different scenarios

scenario 1: your withholdings totaled to $1500 for the year, and you get a $500 refund

scenario 2: your withholdings totaled to $500 for the year, and you have to pay an extra $500 at tax time.

in both scenarios, your tax paid is **exactly** the same. $1000.

don't confuse refunds with how much tax you paid. that misunderstanding is how so many people thought their taxes went up with the trump tax cuts  despite them actually going down.

a refund is just the amount of money you gave the government above and beyond what you owed. you can get a refund and still have paid tens of thousands of dollars in income tax for the year."

"Pretty ridiculous.
You need to kill all of the Taliban, you need to kill all of the Afghans to do that - first of all, you are the aggressors and have no justice. Secondly, you simply have not established is effective rule and a self-circulating benefit distribution scheme.
Iraq was under Saddam's rule for many years, and the people longed for a better life, but after the complete withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, do you think they would have listened to the US completely (which they did even when they weren't withdrawn, bringing in a lot of investment from other countries).
I'll give you another example, what would it be like if the US military withdrew the troops stationed in Japan, Korea, and Germany?
The biggest problem with Americans is that they can't figure out if they are here to rescue others or are they invaders - you only rescued those who learned English, and what about the Afghans who grew poppies?
Did America come in to spread democracy to Afghanistan? Of course not, Biden has said it was to get Bin Laden - essentially, the US invaded other countries for its own benefit, which is so obvious.

"Mate he's fucking useless for how much he cost. We should've got rid last summer when Inter were interested, and now we're stuck with him.

Been at Spurs 2 years, and still not put together a full 90 minutes of good football. He has his moments - and obviously has the talent - but that means fuck-all when you won't or can't apply it consistently. 

Last season he had about 3/4 good performances - the wins against Southampton and Man Utd, and the 3-1 win against Sheffield United. It's not like he set the world alight. He also notably dropped off in the second half of the season (though the whole team did tbf). 

Still, he was usually gassed after 60 minutes with Jose's low intensity style, it's no wonder he gets dropped under Pochettino, Nuno, and even Mason, all who have had the team playing far more pro-actively than Mourinho. If all 3 have felt he's not fit to even play, and Mourinho actively criticised him on plenty of occasions - then clearly the issue lies with him. There's no point having a midfielder that's going to be a passenger most of the game - especially when they're not *so* productive on the ball that it makes up for it. 

Ndombele would've been disappointing for a ¬£15m transfer, for a ¬£55m one, he's an absolute shambles."

"You don't know how Hospitals work.  ICUs have always filled up regularly.  80% bed usage is/was completely normal prior to Covid.

  Additionally if there was such a crunch on hospitals why the FUCK would they be firing significant chunks of their staff who up until recently were completely ok to be employed without the vaccine?

"I‚Äôm not sure exactly when it happened. My parents were exiled from Chile after the Allende government fell. We moved to Canada as refugees.

Our days were busy with organizing, rallies, fund raising, you name it and we probably did it. Peace marches, protests, international women‚Äôs day, Mayday, working locally with unions and students to organize the left. 

I guess I grew-up in the struggle and activism. My parents were active members of the Communist party and worked tirelessly to try and better living conditions of workers in both Canada and Chile. Victor Jara played on repeat in our home. The struggle against fascism was very real as I grew up and it shaped my world view tremendously."

"For the period we had Odegaard, the results had us as a top 4 team. Before Odegaard and ESR, we were utter shit. Then both of them join up in December, and we're much better. So I suppose technically it's the same starting 11 as the second half of last year, when we were a markedly different team compared to the first half.

Another issue for us last season was that Partey was largely unavailable for more than half of the season. Tierney also missed many matches. This meant that our ""depth"" players like Ceballos, Elneny, and Cedric got a ton of starts. All those minutes going to Lokonga and Tavares improves us quite a bit."

"I think Laporte is better than Kimpembe. Subjective, but just my opinion. You have to remember that Laporte didn‚Äôt have a bad season, but was kept out through an injury and then an incredible season from Stones and Dias which saw us keep so many clean sheets in a row. 

Before the start of last season, people were saying he was the best CB in the Prem apart from Van Dijk. He‚Äôs still an incredible player, don‚Äôt forget that.

Whilst it‚Äôs not imperative that teams play with a left footed CB, it can certainly help a bunch when playing certain systems, which is why it definitely can be important. 

I‚Äôm probably not going to change your mind because it‚Äôs borderline impossible on social media but that‚Äôs just my take on it. I think it is downright ludicrous to try and argue that Laporte isn‚Äôt a world class CB to be honest."

"Some might call it ""the ideology of resentment"". There are ways to pay lip service to leftist ideals that don't do anything to serve the implementation of those ideas, but rather focus entirely on condemning the status quo as irreparably broken.

When the majority of ones political involvement focuses on ideological critique of the currently prevailing system without actionable steps to address it, this seems inevitable."

"I survey as a hobby. Make a few bucks and get free stuff.

Been doing it for probably 15 years now. 

In a normal run up to election season as a registered independent I get a small flurry of surveys before the pool dries up until debates. 

In the last 2 months, I have qualified for and completed a record 17 political surveys. And they are increasing in number.

The tone of surveys has changed significantly. Where they normally are really short with mostly multiple choice answers, there are now a lot more open text boxes, a lot more questions about how you voted in the last 4 election cycles (2 used to be the norm).

And over time you can tell by wording the party who paid for it. In the past it would be about a 60/40 split between democrat and republican polling with republican polls asking more about issues, democrat asking more about people/specific candidates, and a small number of outside polls with no spottable party affiliation.

This year, the vast majority of polls are worded like they are out of the democrat/deep state camp, and far more polls are coming from people who are not in the political machine directly.

Heck, I had a toothpaste survey the other day that had a section asking about covid and politics. 

Survey land has become a very interesting place lately, and not just politically. Covid reactions and supply chain shortage reactions are spooking the corporate side, covid and politics are spooking the academic side..."

"One of the reasons our defence looks suspect is because we currently have 5 potential RBs at the club (seeing as how Arteta chose to bring on Tavares at RB last week at Brentford with Bellerin sitting right there on the bench) and NONE of them are good enough to play for us.

"""Psychological coding,"" even outside football or sports tends to be highly unreliable. People don't react the same way to emotions. One guy who isn't confident might take tons of shots in hopes of proving that he's good, another might be too scared. It seems a little counterproductive, because if a player is performing well does it matter whether he's feeling confident or not? What if the stress and anxiety motivates someone to do better, like Pogba in the WC after his father died?"

I mean if you have the karma, go for it, dude. But if you don't, don't come to us and complain about being censored. I don't think you get that that's what we're talking about here.

"I'm from Nicaragua, which I still consider socialist. But back in the 80s we were an ML state. I did not live through it but my parents and family in general did.

The defining feature of that era was the civil war against the Contras or the counter-revolution, a CIA-funded mercenary army. So it was not exactly paradise of course, still, the period is considered a golden age of worker's rights, union power, popular organizations and advancements in social matters and education.

A common line of remembrance was ""We were at war, but we never starved"" in reference to the food rationing system in place to avoid food crises and such.

The memory of socialist policies was strong and positive enough to catapult the FSLN back into power by 2007 at least."

You guys are gonna need to give Beal away at some point.

On the other hand peaceful protestors were raped and murdered in South Sudan until a conclusion where the oppressors split power with the leaders of the protests. 

As Trotsky rightly argued, ‚ÄúAs long as human labor power, and, consequently, life itself, remain articles of sale and purchase, of exploitation and robbery, the principle of the ‚Äúsacredness of human life‚Äù remains a shameful lie, uttered with the object of keeping the oppressed slaves in their chains.‚Äù"

Regardless capitalism is supported by instruments of violence, the police and the military, they will use violence when the capitalist system is genuinely threatened.

Capitalism was born into this world dripping blood from head to toe. Revolutions in the Netherlands, England, America and France allowed the capitalist system to be born.

">People are filling political compass tests and taking the results too seriously like they want to be part of a faction in the socialist left.

That's not ""the left"", that's internet liberals whose interest in socialism ends in aesthetics.

Honestly, this whole post is repeatedly conflating internet *leftists* with real organization, as if they were synonymous (they are not) which, if anything, points towards a lack of familiarity with radical organization.

No, there's not a lack of discussion of ideological and practical strategies within organizations, but they are done within organizations, not in twitter or reddit. Similarly, there's no such thing as problems for the sake of *liking or disliking Lenin*, that's an online thing which evolves around leftist aesthetics; ongoing discussions about previous socialist projects (whichever it is) are analysis aimed at learning from past struggles to apply it to present and past struggles, something which no movement can renounce.

>I dont think we need to condemn social democrats ideas just because they are social democrats if those policies help the workers.

Social imperialism is an anti-socialist and anti-worker tendency (unless for you proletarian internationalism ends in the imperial core, of course) which must be threated like what it is, an enemy to emancipation.

And that's precisely why principled discussion is a huge necessity."
"Well, all socialist groups see the problems with capitalism, but they all have their own opinions on how to plan a socialist country if a theoretical revolution were to be successful. We're basically left with only a couple options: 1, have near complete unity until after a revolution were to happen, where it's likely to be a complete shitshow until eventually one socialist ideology prevails, or 2, figure out our differences before a revolution were to happen and go forth with the most popular ideology, or something like that. Obviously things can happen differently, but personally I see those being the most likely options."

"As a theory for economic value, the labor theory for value *is* dated in the field. It's not something you can really use to make any good calculations about prices, the value of the produced goods. Calculating the surplus value isn't very helpful or especially feasible from the perspective of mainstream economics.

But the point of the LBT isn't made for that kind of analysis to begin with. A good counter argument is to point to Marx dual role as both an economist and a founding father of *sociology*. Marx acutely points out that there has to be an invisible *relational* value transfer between two classes. This value, then, isn't strictly economical but cultural - one class gets a bigger size of the cake no matter what. Pierre Bordieu expands om different forms of social capitals in the 70's, from this tradition from Marx inside sociology.

So my idea for a response is to educate people on the intersection between sociology and economy - and that for some (obviously political) reason, the field of economy stopped being interested in other economical theory outside of markets and state politics.

Also, mainstream economy is too fixated on theory and too little on empirical data."

Inter fans don't have many expectations about the next season but personally I'm hopeful, regardless of this season I'm sure that in the Winter/next Summer window we'll manage to improve our squad depth and quality.

&#x200B;

So far we got Calhanoglu for free, Dzeko for free (max fee 1.5m if we reach a CL spot iirc), Dumfries for just 12.5m, we finalized the purchase of Darmian for 2.5m and supposedly we are willing to spend 25/30m for either Correa, Thuram or Insigne.

&#x200B;

This season is going to be pretty average if you ask me, Zanetti himself, probably being pressured by both the management and the coach, stated that it is going to be a difficult season for Inter, especially since every single club in Italy except us has greatly improved in team depth and quality in this window.

Getting a CL spot is our goal this season but it would be nice if our team could instantly adapt to Inzaghi to defend the title."

"He was benched after another shocker against Spurs last season. He was given multiple chances after that, played the league matches in the CL run in and was average. Not awful but his performances were nowhere near Dias or Stones."

"Its because even though the Warriors were missing Kevin Durant, they were still considered nearly invincible. I was road tripping through the US back to Canada between games 2-3 of the Finals and all day every talking head on the radio was convinced that even without Klay the Warriors were going to win game 3 at home.

That and the Blazers were overachieving that year at least in terms of public perception. Dame game winner and CJ round 2 game 7 performance won a lot of favor for that squad"

You don't think people are watch the Lakers, Rockets, Clippers for the stars they had? Compare those team's audience numbers when playing the warriors vs. other teams you'll see that their games against the warriors were pretty low in rating for them. It's kind of frustrating that you don't understand the numbers you cited nor attribute the increase interest in warrior's games due to steph...

Their local viewership plummeted that season. Warriors suddenly being back to number 1 on local TV rating after losing 66% of their average viewership doesn't say something?

This year the Warriors were pretty much number 1 in national television ratings..."

"football players in general tend to be less educated, they are also generally very wealthy and a lot of them are famous and influential too. Combine those things together and it makes the odds of football players getting vaccinated pretty low"
"I have two thoughts on this.

The first is that becoming an effective socialist is a process. The first step of radicalization is realizing that the status quo (global imperialist capitalism) doesn't work. Given how much pro capitalist propaganda there is in the West (and especially the US) this is a big hurdle, in and of itself. But more and more, it's undeniable to basically everyone but boomers that capitalism is a hellish system, and it's ideology is a death cult. Hell, even boomers intuitively understand how fucked everything is, they just misattribute the problems to Qanon/NWO conspiracy shit. 

So it's important to be anticapitalist, and to understand in detail why capitalism is awful and why it needs to be abolished. 

The problem is that you can't stop there. And to that end, the capitalist class seems to accept that most people don't believe in capitalism anymore. They can handle rejecting capitalism. What they can't handle is people finding the solution. And here I mean the only solution that has ever had any degree of success in overthrowing capitalism and putting something new in: Marxism-leninism. 

My second, related thought is that the bourgeois/capitalist class have a strong, vested interest in promoting the idea that communism is/was an abysmal failure, that the USSR was a failure, that China is either capitalist-revisionist or an authoritarian hellhole(or both), etc. So ""acceptable"" leftist thought is channeled into either 

1.anarchism, a noble idea, and the endgame of MLism, but a misguided attempt to abolish the state immediately, leaving the workers revolution vulnerable to capitalist reaction (as has been demonstrated time and again throughout history). 

2. Despair and nihilism with edgy socialist aesthetics (see above)

3. Fruitless electoralism and DSA style ""socialism"" that inevitably gets crushed or coopted into the dictatorship of the bourgeois (see AOC, Bernie, etc ). What's more, this co-opts political energy into a direction that is not only fruitless, but actually ends up supporting capitalism in the end (in the US, through it's DNC stooges). 

There's a reason ML groups, countries, and revolutions are routinely demonized, and if you consider yourself a socialist of any stripe, you should know better than to accept that it's because the State department is telling the truth."
"Speak for yourself.  The bourgeois will often side with the 1% (which is a poor analysis in the first place), so I am definitely at war with the group that is propping up the ruling class."
They wouldn't need to. They already have all the data they need on US citizens solely from social media other apps.
And nothing of value was lost.
"The airline made reference to them being in an exit row and ""loose items"" not being allowed at take off to try to shift blame. ""Under the seat"" works for everything fucking else, so I'm going to bet on it all starting with some hostile shit from cabin crew and no attempt to work together."

"Not at all that simple. The afghan army was trainer to conduct war operations identically to the way the US does. The US conducts war operations with a heavy emphasis on a strong air force; things like air drops and rescue, drones strikes, bombing runs. Afghanistan does not have the kind of air force needed to perform these operations, so when the US began training them in our form of war, they were reliant on the back bone of the American air force, which they were told would assist them in conducting these operations. The second they lost the American air force, the afghan army had to fold. They were literally incapable of conducting warfare without it because they were trained, by us, to conduct war in a way that is entirely reliant upon it. Was that a bad decision? In hindsight, probably, but that's not their fault nor was it their decision. We abandoned them. 

I love America, but honestly, if I'm any other nation I'm afraid of allying with us. We're shit allies. We abandon our own constantly, and we do nothing to stand up for our principles across the world. China may be evil, but at least they're predictable - odds are, if you sell your soul to them, they won't leave you high and dry."

"I became socialist quite recently actually (compared to most people). A year ago,me and a friend of mine finished CoD world at war together and i got interested in looking into WW2 more because of the hype from the game. Well one thing led to another and i learned about the contribution of the soviet union. It got me real interested into the USSR and at that time i was more of a meme lord and not really a socialist,but then some videos of explaining the ussr system and explaining socialism popped up in my reccomendations (most notably from YouTubers like Hakim or The Finnish Bolshevik) and i watched those videos and slowly but surely continued watching and learned the basics. Since i was starting to see the major flaws of capitalism and how socialism is generally better,i started reading books that were reccomended by hakim(which i mentioned beforehand) and really that's what made me a socialist. It was a butterfly effect from finishing CoD world at war to getting into WW2 and learning about the USSR and then getting into the system of the USSR and politics. I still have much to learn but yes, that's what made me a socialist.

"West Ham just don't have the depth to sustain it, especially as they'll be in Europe this year"
">his end of season farewell to Arsenal was more heartfelt than this and that‚Äôs after a half a season loan.

yeah it's because he was planning on staying.

It was very strange that Odegaard suddenly asked for a loan at RM after six months to move to Arsenal, a club not in La Liga (where he previously was) and who were doing terribly at the time. As a short-term move it made little sense. Turns out he did it because it was a long-term move."
"If that excuse was legitimate they would be going after the vodka and caviar imports as well, but we all know exactly what this was really about."
His first season he also managed Barca's B team. His success there is part of what made it so he was offered the job on the main team.
"People are downvoting me but as someone who has actually watched him a lot, he has *incredible* talent. His main asset is his ability to resist pressing and initiate attacks when the opposition is high up the field. He basically combines the incredible technical ability you would expect from a tricky winger with an exceptional ability to pass the ball under pressure. He‚Äôs very unique and it‚Äôs better to just watch a highlights video to understand what I mean"
"My guess is that it can affect vulnerable people more often. Like if a young man doesn't have a father figure he'll listen to rap and take after that. Or perhaps he turns to destructive behaviors and rap is just a side affect.

One thing I know for sure is that having a culture that surrounds itself with debauchery is not a good thing."
"western capitalism and especially American capitalism is so tied up with race though. In the U.S. you have a country built by slave labor and also (along with Canada, Australia, and Israel) settler-colonial genocide. you can't pick one to put over the other, building socialism without a very specific aspect to deal with racism (self determination) will perpetuate those old systems. you just can't do one without the other.

"These previous posters do a wonderful job of explaining and offering resources. I just want to highlight the importance of white supremacy within fascism. More often than not (I honestly can‚Äôt think of an example off the top of my head that doesn‚Äôt fit the description) they go hand in hand. While America isn‚Äôt a fascist nation, systemic racism and white supremacy infiltrate every aspect of life in the USA. This along with increasing corporate power and legislative policies that negatively effect racial, sexual, and gender minorities are quickly putting us on a fascist path. More troubling are the amount of democrats and republicans advocating for such policies due to monetary gain through lobbying. Likewise, many southern, working class, (especially white) Americans are promoting and advocating for alt right and white supremacist Ideas. Ideas that directly contradict their current life situations. Ideas that would cause them more issues than benefits and lead to a more authoritative country (something they obviously don‚Äôt want but seem to consistently vote for). 
Okay‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm rambling‚Ä¶ sorry."
">Cringe

My team has championships. Sorry that you aren‚Äôt focused on winning. The only sadness is that Lebron James has failed to win a real ring with us. Instead we got a bubble ring"
This is a bit much
