"I've never been into mobile gaming cause of these reasons. I know people are working overtime to bring us the best they possibly can in a smallest form factor. A handset / hand held device which can perform on the best speed possible when it comes to CPU 'n GPU (Samsung/Apple flagships), a battery that can make a dent like 5100 mah (Lenovo did it long back ""P2""), 120 Hz panel (Razor proved it!), Speakers (Razor again!), but with the things that haven't been figured out yet or maybe I'm not aware such as Palm/touch rejection,  temp control (Liquid metal is a start!), anti-sweat panel/back panel (Extremely specific for few users out there) and maybe even wireless display connectivity/speaker system for home use. Dude, one can just a dream. One day.........."

You should do a pantry tour. Like if you agree!
Interested in how it emphasizes a clear cut segment of phone use and (especially) how it may push tech forward in this area. Love your emphasis on the global view...something U.S. citizens are often lacking. I'm excited at the idea of coming back to this review in a year and in 5 years to see where things have gone.Thumbed for that reason.

"As far as mobile gaming is concerned.  The only way I can favor this, is if I was 2 use it for games you pay 2 play the full game.  Paying more money than a Switch 4 the phone itself, and whatever the games costs.  IAP is over the top at this point.  I do feel this phone could have potential."

5. He isn't even in the movie, so we don't know if he died or not. He certainly didn't die the way you said he should.

Though i'm not sure how the maintenance will work on such a device. Is there a way to fill water/cooling liquid in? Do we have to bring the phone to a certified maintenance facility every other year? The Idea sounds good on paper but i'm pretty sceptical on how this will work in real life...."

"Hey wwe since you arenâ€™t booking lashley properly, listen to this.. this sunday, when strowman and lashley beat k.o and zayn, lashley should turn heel and spear strowman, eventually setting up lashley vs lesnar or a triple threat with stowman. Hell even a fatal fourway with reigns if ya want.
Lashley isnt a mic guy like lesnar, thats why he should be a silent heel that says hea here for business not the fans"
"I think gaming will be picked in next level with something like VR glasses, cause main distraction is this small screen. But if you have such glasses where you don't need to put you phone in, instead keep holding it in your hand while gaming. Glasses will provide full immersion while phone will be used as controller and computing device at same time."

Dane H it's obviously a joke
"The design is simply a salamander with wings and claws.  When have they ever confirmed it to be based on a dragon?

Even if it was designed to be one, it doesn't matter within the context of the universe itself.  It's not considered a dragon within its own universe, so it can't be considered a dragon for this list.  Although that does mean that Fin Fang Foom also doesn't count, but a lot of people are already complaining about that choice for that very reason."

"The House of Colonna hold the continual position of Prince Assistants to the Papal Throne at the Vatican. They claim to be the Julio-Claudian dynasty of ancient Rome and directly descend from Peter de Columna and the Counts of Tusculum. Cologne Germany was named Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium named for the Julio-Claudian family. The Colonna family use the column on their coat of arms which is a symbol for political power. The Colonna name derives from the Greek word kolona which means a column. The Columbus and Colombo names also derive from Columna and from Peter de Columna. Christopher Columbus was a relative of the Colonna family and he claimed America for Rome. Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa and was funded by the Doria banking family who are intermarried with the House of Colonna. America is named after Amerigo Vespucci an Italian explorer working for the House of Medici. Amerigo Vespucci created the term New World for the Americas. Novus Ordo Seclorum is Latin and means New Order of the Ages and is on the US dollar and US great seal. The Vatican City State is the only nation on the planet that uses Latin as an official language.

The Colonna's control the Colombo crime family and several Jewish mafia factions which also run Hollywood and Columbia Pictures for Black Nobility like the House of Colonna. They also have majority ownership over the Chicago Outfit. The House of Colonna control the Knights of Columbus which uses the Roman fasces symbol for its logo. There are many police officers and federal agents that are members of the Knights of Columbus. The Colonna family have influence over police and organized crime. The Five Families are covert business enterprises for the Italian Nobility and they use their mafia to blackmail politicians. Prince Prospero Colonna di Stigliano is the current head of the Stigliano branch and his wife Princess Frances Colonna. The Colonna family come from Alba Longa and established a branch in Salamanca Spain known as the Dukes of Alba which merged with the FitzJames family of England. Salamanca uses the column on its flag where the Dukes of Alba ruled. Diego Columbus marriedÂ Maraa de Toledo of the House of Alba. The Colonna family are also related to theÂ Coloma family of Spain which settled in Belgium as powerful counts and landowners.

Prince Guido Colonna di Paliano was a Commissioner of the European Union, Italian Vice Consul to New York City and a member of the Trilateral Commission. Jerry Colonna is a financier from New York City who helped to establish Silicon Valley. Jerry Colonna who is believed to be worth over 50 million started a small investment group called Flatiron Partners which was in the business of making billions for companies like JP Morgan Chase. Jerry Colonna is protected by organized crime which attack me whenever I mention him. Jerry Colonna appears to be used for handling their illegal transactions and for money laundering. The Colonna family came from Alba in Rome and Saint Albans was one of their agents who settled in Saint Albans name after him in England. The Roman Alban clan later created the Barons Romney that established themselves about 100 miles away from Saint Albans. The name Romney means Roman. The Colonna family ceremonially rule over Capitoline Hill which represents the political power of Rome's corporate empire.

The column symbolizes the political support that maintains their claim to governmental land ownership. Freemasonry uses two pillars or columns in their temples for the two Colonna princely lines of Stigliano and Paliano. Paliano comes from the Latin word Palus meaning a stake or support like a pillar. The Colonna family also intermarried with the Barberini papal nobility which use bees on their coat of arms. The Mormon Church was created by Freemasons from New York and Mormonism uses bees and beehives as a common symbol. Mitt Romney is a powerful Mormon and politician. Romney means Roman. Washington DC is Roman architecture and has the Roman fasces symbol all over US federal buildings and US seals. Fascism means a centralization of power. Capitol Hill is named after Capitoline Hill in Rome. Washington DC was called Rome in 1669. Members of the Colonna crime family include Prince Prospero Colonna di Stigliano, Prince Stefano Colonna di Stigliano, Prince Oddone Colonna, Prince Prospero Colonna di Paliano, Prince Marcantonio Colonna di Paliano, Prince Urbano Riario Sforza Barberini Colonna di Sciarra, Princess Frances Colonna di Stigliano, Jerry Colonna, and Stefano Colonna from the University of Milan who developed the Julia-Colonna Epoxidation process used in vaccines. Prince Prospero of Stigliano and Prince Marcantonio of Paliano are the heads of this Roman clan."

Also, I have a different interpretation. People want to sleep with rockstars and athletes, I don't hear very much about women flocking to tech billionaires or anything like that. Though I'm sure they could find someone that wants to be taken care of. If it was acceptable for men to do the same, more men would do it as well as more women become rich. A small amount of it is about men or women nature, but it's mostly culture."

"I don't really care who drafts the bill, actually. Not for the purpose of this discussion, anyway. The input of the lawyers would be to ensure that the text offers no alternative interpretation.
So why would I prefer lawyers to bullet-proof a bill ? Because of Legaleese. Politicians use their own lingo, but when one wants to circumvent a legal constraint, one gets a lawyer.
It looks a lot like Ro-Sham-Bo. Politician speak is often vague enough to bore loopholes in many texts. Legaleese is technical, precise, strives to eliminate double entendre and incertitudes ; Legaleese wins. My theoretical politician would hire the most vicious lawyers he/she could find to make his/her bill as unassailable, as unambiguous, as self sufficient, as rhetorically inert as possible. 
But again, this scenario will probably never happen. :)"

You should check out his channel. 

The combined agencies of the city police, county sheriffs, and state HWP troopers are the largest terrorist gang in the world. And the only terrorists I see with my own eyes, robbing, raping, abusing, abduction, extorting and yes, there are no shortage of murders on their hands. For goodness sakes! these cops murdered Dillon Taylor because they couldn't stand to see him enjoying music, then mocked, joked and laughed at the grieving friends and family at an event to morn his loss.

"You're correct about how it's gross to shake peoples' hands.

I'll take that as a yes to the latter and no answer for the former.
"Your point is the US makes and sells weapons and that is the reality of the situation, which does provide a decent source of income for the nation. I don't even disagree with that, because it isn't like the US hasn't done that in the past and it will continue to do so into the future. Weapons exist, so someone has to make and sell them. How am I doing so far? Has your assumption paid off yet?

Before I go on I'll just remark that I always take TYT with a grain of salt, because frankly they're a little too overtly bias for the left and I've seen them make errors. I do consider myself a leftist, probably farther left than most. Regardless I want accurate information, not preaching to the choir. 

Now that we have that out of the way. You seem to be asserting that they are saying that making weapons is bad and they should not be sold to other countries because weapons are evil anti-flower loving things blah blah blah, and that is their argument against Trump in this case. But, nothing like that is ever said throughout the video, there's nothing about denying the reality that the US makes arms and sell those arms. The main point brought up is not being a moron by having the oversight of those sales done by a department that doesn't have the experience required to determine whether or not those weapons are going to someone who could be a potential threat out of a short-sighted desire to sell more of them.

And then the slightly more subjective point of how sad it is that Trump is going around trying to sell weapons to people like a door to door salesman who gets the door slammed in his face half the time because he's desperate for approval. But like I said, that's pretty subjective and not of any significant substance.  

So in summery, selling weapons is a reality that exists, and that's fine. Just be smart about it. And... you're ugly. Or something, since apparently personal appearance seems to somehow add value to an argument according to you."

The .223/5.56 round is not a popular option for anything over the size of a coyote as it does not have the ""power"" (know down power) of say a .308/7.62 cartridge."

"Sean Peterson 
Why am I not surprised that it's a thing in Southern Georgia?

I hate all these political signs on a car. Seriously, it's just the lowest form of symbolic political discourse.
This is putting political issues that have repercussions on people lives right next to truck nuts.

You want to change something? How about showing up at the office of your local politician?"
"Yeah, but you know--sometimes you think, ""Is it worth it?"" I should've asked him what he had against him, personally.  TBH, I have only seen his truck twice, since Trump was elected."
"I will feel the same. The sign is indecent but I do lean towards allowing them to keep it.  But this is a person who I will not want to be associated with. And if that person were to drive up to a job interview at a company I ran I will not hire them on that sign alone.

You think you have a coherent framework, but all you have is your own opinions. The 2nd amendment is ambiguous enough that many differing federal laws can be enacted while still upholding the 2nd amendment.

Tell me, what arms should be regulated? If you start there, then I'll entertain a conversation.

If you want to pretend all arms should be legal, then why doesn't The Walton Family or George Soros have the right to purchase a nuclear weapon?

Perhaps you interpret the word ""bear"" to mean: able to carry on ones body.
But dirty bombs are able to be carried on ones own body. So should those be legal? Why or why not?

Notice, the 2nd amendment does not mention fire arms or guns, just arms."

Your ""feelings"" do not give you the right to strip others of their personal freedoms.  Women can wear whatever they want, and some whackjob religious nutters ""feelings"" does not trump her personal freedom to dress how she wants.

When the SJW's and racists on the left start talking about microaggressions and safe spaces, where you think you can strip someone else of their basic human rights just to satisfy your ""Feelings"", you nutjobs end up sounding just as delusional as this Eqyptian lawyer.  People talking about punching nazi's, and attacking trump supporters, having dorms that exclude whites, having black-only graduations at College.....  Congrats, both the left and the right have reached a level playing field of extremism, violence and racism.

And in all the stupidity since Trump got elected, the left has ended up making a lot of conservative personalities end up lookign reasonable, and pushed liberals more to the right of the political spectrum.

The left destroyed their own base, forgot what being an actual LIBERAL meant, and turned into a bunch of ideological extremists, basing everything off identity politics, reversing the progress of race relations, and treating people SPECIFICALLY based on their race, and sex, and creating a progressive stack - the left turned into the racist equivalent of conservatives on the far right.  Trump is president because the left fell apart."

"The left has never claimed Trump anti-war.  The Republicans at the Primary made WAR central to their platform.   Dems were less enthusiastic, but also wanted/expected war.  Trump is the False Prophet (false profit).    Xi is the dragon. (Nixon, spelled inside out, is Xionn) And Putin is  PUT IN charge of the  2nd beast in Daniel 7: 5.   (arise devour much flesh)

"I like and admire Reich a lot, but he did not accomplish much of what he wanted to. Clinton got mostly everything he wanted and his neo-liberal policies were devastating. Clinton and Reich were often on opposite sides.

The gogo 90's can be attributed to the internet age, which lead to a bubble, and NAFTA, which lead to a furthering decline of manufacturing. Nafta spurred economic growth as the US was ramping up to profit off its implementation, but as the policy matured the result was clear, Wall St profits would go up and wages and benefits would go down."

You're arguing semantics about secession, and whether it makes the rebel stars and bars traitorous to display? I'll point out one thing, under the eyes of the Union, when Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation it applied to ""all"" slaves in the secessionist states as well. Your trying to make an argument that the Confederacy was making after seceding. Because they wanted to be seen as a new nation. They weren't before that, it was all a ploy to keep they're slaves and not have to adhere to Federal Government. Get over it, they lost, so if you want to believe that way, fine.....that's the way it was, until the Union was re-united. See, the government never recognized the Confederacy as a nation, that's why it was treasonous. All you needed to say was, it isn't treasonous to display the flag in your own private property."

Secondly you're basically saying that if you receive a false label then if you're not careful with your response (thou doth protest too much) or not respond at all then that makes the label true paying no attention to the guy spreading falsehoods. No, its still false.

Taylor Swift shouldn't have to respond to me if for example I make a video claiming that her music videos are full of satanic imagery that compels people to murder the elderly, any articles paying any credence to my video without supporting evidence isn't journalism but mere click seeking and that should be the real story not Swift's lawyer doing his or her job."

I want my old plan back that I was promised I could keep which turned out to be a lie."

Trump apparently saw Sasse on Fox Noise and had to tweet. Republicans need not worry (outside of the fact that they are morally bankrupt corporate toadies and their president is con man) about this being Trump's position. He has none.

"UNDERSTANDING
HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA

Over and over and over again we hear the American citizen ask, ""Why is our country the only nation in the industrialized free world that doesn't guarantee free health coverage to its citizens?""

It's because we aren't listening to the ANSWER or maybe because we just find it too difficult if not impossible to believe.  

That answer is, ""Because we are a CAPITALIST society"".   That means we pay for whatever we get. The federal government can't offer us 100% guaranteed free health coverage because that would compete with free enterprise. It would never get past Capitalists. 

In hard, harsh language, as a health care provider in a Capitalistic society, my right to charge you to be able to stay alive at whatever is the cost I choose to impose is greater than your right to stay alive if you can‚Äôt afford it. What's more, that's the LAW; not in those words of course, but it is the LAW.

The bottom line is that in the richest country in the world ‚Äì wealthier still than the next 4 wealthiest countries combined -- we will wreck our savings, sell our homes, beg, borrow, steal -- or die -- in order to get the kind of health coverage we finally achieved under President Obama and which Trump is working overtime to take away from us. Those are the alternatives to health care now facing Americans under this administration because, once again, the insurance company has the right to charge you to be able to stay alive at whatever is the cost it chooses to impose, a right greater than your right to stay alive if you can‚Äôt afford it. 

The ""president"" agrees with this ‚Äúdeath panel‚Äù policy.
So too does the majority of the House. 
So too does the majority of the Senate.
So too will a Justice system imbalanced 5-4 and likely to be soon imbalanced 6-3 or even 7-2.

How in the world did we EVER get here?

I will tell you. On election day you decided to watch World Wide Wrestling instead, or to play some game on your computer. Maybe you just spent the day doing the couch potato. Maybe it looked like rain and you decided not to chance it.

In essence no one really did a thing to you. You committed suicide. Your contribution to changing the status quo was your decision to do nothing.

There are 8,760 hours in a year or 35,040 hours in the 4 years between elections. You need maybe 2 hours to go to town and file for an ID and perhaps another 5 to go vote on a heavier-than-usual election day turn out -- 7 hours total. Round that to 10 hours to allow for a flat tire or a stop at Juan In A Million's for an awesome taco and a beer on the way back from voting. Bottom line, 10 from 35,040 still leaves you 35,030 to do everything else.

I don't care if you hold down 3 jobs, have no car, live 3 miles from the closest bus stop or happen to be sick 95% of those 35,040 hours. You are still left well over 1,000 hours to get an ID and go vote, not to mention you have alternatives that will consume even less time -- such as mailing in your ballot. 

Consider this, that you may instead decide to find a full day to take to the streets later on and participate in a massive protest with 100s of thousands of other protesting citizens, but not a half day or less to go get an ID and vote?

That‚Äôs an excuse looking for a reason to be the poor, helpless victim or more dramatic still, to down a double Prestone Anti-Freeze Margarita. Do Juan In A Million's instead. It is much more satisfying, plus you can STILL take to the streets after the fact to protest -- and maybe even to CELEBRATE, not to mention you'll be healthier, happier and in much better financial condition because you voted."

But, at least you have Ms. Maddow to tell you just how unpopular the POTUS really is. After all, the media says so, right? Here's a new thought for the liberal media. Instead of assuming everyone thinks like you and chattering in an echo chamber, maybe, just maybe, ponder this radical idea. What if millions of people dislike you as much as you say people dislike Trump?"

"I heard that the doctors in the U.S. have since rescinded their offer of assistance, because they say that the treatment would not benefit Charlie. I don't know if that is true or not...? People on BBC's FB page told me that when they got stuck into me for saying that I don't think it is right for any government or court to overrule parental rights and decide that this child must die.

Besides the insults levelled at me, some pointed out that, given Charlie's current situation, prolonging the inevitable is tantamount to child abuse.

I still find it deeply unsettling that a court can overrule parental rights and decide that a person, in this case a baby, should die."

Is National Review's grammar is worse than Trump's? üòÜ
Insanity. So sorry for the innocent people harmed.
"Remember that lovely little ""assessment"" report released to congress and the press breaking the ""proof"" of Russian interference? Barely a moment was spent describing the supposed proof, more time was spent on what is an ""assessment"" or ""judgment"", how they reach assessments or judgments, and how they rate these assessments and judgments.

But the majority of the report was actually dedicated to showing that RT was an arm of Russian government propaganda.  The report even went so far as to detail examples of what they call ""propaganda"" including:

RT covered Occupy Wall Street and came to the conclusion that Wall Street is greedy.  Who woulda known?!

RT covered fracking and said it was bad for the environment. Scandalous!

RT coverage questioned the integrity of U.S. elections because of the undue influence in big money in our political system. Hmmm...didn't we have a candidate who basically ran their campaign on this topic?  And drew tens of thousands to hear that message, filling stadium after stadium to overflowing? Oh yeah...I think his name was Bernie.

And most egregious of all, the straw that must have broken the back of the voters in the U.S. and affected the election, thus proving Russian meddling, RT actually had the audacity to give coverage to the third-party presidential candidate debates.  How could they?  How dastardly!

These and more were listed in that report as examples of Russian ""propaganda"".

Propaganda my ass. Seems to me like RT was committing actual acts of journalism.  

This is the insane nature of the push to try to prove in some fashion that ""Russia did it"" even though not ONE of our intelligence agencies have actually examined the DNC servers, multiple FBI requests for access having been denied by Debbie and the DNC.

Perhaps they can't hand over the servers because they don't want what is in them to become available as potential evidence in the ongoing class-action civil-suit against Debbie and the DNC for defrauding U.S. donors to a Democratic party that claimed it was running an equal platform for ALL Democratic presidential candidates when they had no intent of backing anyone but Hillary.

There would also surely be more evidence in there of the pervasive and egregious election fraud committed on behalf or at the behest of Hillary in the primaries.

As well there may be evidence of The Clinton Foundation involvement in essentially laundering donations for Hillary's use in the campaign. To my knowledge, there is STILL an ongoing investigation into the Clinton Foundation as well, noting the closure of one of their main means of fundraising, the Clinton Global Initiative.

Or maybe there simply isn't any evidence of Russia hacking, which would mean the DNC emails were leaked, and the question then turns to ""Who LEAKED the emails, and attention will swing right back on to Seth Rich and his ongoing murder investigation.

Regardless of whether there is proof of any Russian interference or not the fact remains that Debbie and the DNC refused access to those servers, and NO ONE, not Debbie, not the DNC, not John Podesta, not even Hillary, are asking that the servers be examined so the truth can be known.  Even IF there were actual proof of Russian interference there, which I seriously doubt, that they have not relinquished those servers makes it plain to see they are hiding something in those servers.  To not hand over the evidence to do what they so badly desire, which is to take down Trump and Russia simultaneously, it is obvious that they are hiding some thing, or things.

We must subpoena and examine those servers, not to look for evidence of Russian hacking or interference, but to look into the evidence of ANY improprieties or illicit activities on ANY party or party's part, from the beginning of the primaries to the end of the general election. 

And until that happens, until our intelligence agencies actually have their hands on those servers and whatever proof they hold, instead of relying on the ""assessment"" of a third-party cyber-security firm employed BY the DNC, and until they transparently release solid proof of such meddling, I am calling the ""Russia did it"" narrative complete bullshit, a political move aimed at demonizing Russia to sway American sentiment in favor of expanded perpetual war for the sake of profit, power over, and regime change's sake. And such ugly brinksmanship might even put us in a shooting war WITH Russian, a major nuclear power.  These are dangerous lies in a dangerous game they are playing, a game where OUR propaganda machine keeps telling us ""Russia, Russia, Russia."" They've got nothing on the skill of our propagandizers!"

Or, what if a woman was doing drugs/alcohol before she knew she was pregnant. That baby would suffer the consequences and the mother would be deemed unfit. What about incest?  There are situations that are SO bad that abortion should be allowed.  And if you ban it, women would be getting abortions from untrained medical personnel and could permanently damaged. And what happened to women being able to make their own decisions about their bodies and get professional treatment."

Federal judge turns back Hawaii's motion on Trump's travel ban

Thursday, July 6th 2017, 9:43 pm MDT

A federal judge has denied an emergency motion filed by the State of Hawaii that would broaden the familial exceptions to President Trump's travel ban. 

In a motion filed by the state after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated portions of the ban on June 26, Attorney General Doug Chin argued that the Trump administration wrongly excluded grandparents and other relatives from the list of family members who can obtain visas to travel to the United States."

"Remember when Donald Trump was business partners with the Russian government and his company got 53 million from the Russian government investment fund called Rusnano that was started by Vladimir Putin and is referred to as ""Putin's Child""?

Oh wait, that wasn't Trump it was John Podesta.

Remember when Donald Trump received 500 thousand for a speech in Moscow and paid for by Renaissance Capital, a company tied to Russian Intelligence Agencies?

Oh wait, that was Bill Clinton.

Remember when Donald Trump approved the sale of 20% of US uranium to the Russians while he was Secretary of State which gave control of it to Rosatom the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation?

Oh wait, that was Hillary Clinton.

Remember when Donald Trump lied about that and said he wasn't a part of approving the deal that gave the Russians 1/5 of our uranium, but then his emails were leaked showing he did lie about it?

Oh wait, that was Hillary Clinton and John Podesta.

Remember when Donald Trump got 145 million dollars from shareholders of the uranium company sold to the Russians?

Oh wait, that was Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.

Remember when Donald Trump accepted millions in donations from Russian Oligarchs like the chairman of a company that's part of the Russian Nuclear Research Cluster, the wife of the mayor of Moscow, and a close pal of Putins?

Oh wait, that was the Clinton Foundation.

Remember when Donald Trump failed to disclose all those donations before becoming the Secretary of State, and it was only found out when a journalist went through Canadian tax records?

Oh wait, that was Hillary Clinton.

Remember when Donald Trump told Mitt Romney that the 80s called and it wanted its Russian policy back. The Cold War is over?

Oh wait, that was President Obama.

Other than his narcissistic personality being unable to cope with the narrow margin of his win and the fact that the Russians helped him get there, he shouldn't have to worry about the investigation when it comes to his own personal culpability. Unless, again, he is trying to cover up to keep the facts from coming out. The harder he tries, the guiltier he looks."

Hey Miss GQ please explain why you posed scantily clad and suggestively for that MENS magazine. And NO, not ""all women"" in the USA are against Trump. I don't appreciate you, of all women, thinking that you are the spokesperson for other women. You have no class or grace. And you are so superficial and phony that it oozes out of you. Go work at CNN."
"And that's why Trump flew to France yesterday, to watch a shiny parade. Because work is for the little people."
Are we seriously not putting an e on largesse?
"90 day travel ban while they fix the vetting from 6 countries. How about fixing the vetting in, say 120 days, without the travel ban.  Trump has had nearly 200 days, why is the vetting not fixed yet?    Can anyone explain to me why the ban is required to fix the vetting? Anyone? The ban is nothing but punitive."
Still barely $30K a year in a very expensive city.
"Good luck MSNBC. Trump will be getting you when he's done with CNN.

Your fake news to."
More treason!
"Either the ""loving Muslims"" get on board with flushing out the terrorists, or get out, because by not doing so, they are also part of the problem."
"His full blown misogyny and sexism reared it's ugly head almost immediately. With totally inappropriate comments made to Mrs. Macron.
Jeebus, this man is such a fecking loser. No class. No diplomacy."
"OH my gosh, an accurate statement! But they started the game....and Trump plays it better.  He's playing chess while they're playing tiddlywinks."
"The death of a party. Sad indictment on Republicans who are willing to sell out their souls,ethics, morals, and our democracy in exchange for their policies. Truly a shame"
"Opposition research has been going on for many decades , this woman told him she might have something . He is a private citizen , he was not running for president !! MOUNTAINS OUT OF MOLEHILLS and Democrats get ant hills out of their MOUNTAINS OF EVIDENCE OF AGAINST THEM !"
The sad part is all he has to do is say he forgot and the supporter's will come to his defense and making a delusional reality for the believers in Lord Cheesus and his disciples in the white house
I blame 45 and his regime
"Could this be the monstrously big thing that Putin is blackmailing Trump over? Assume that the Russian agent that Donald Junior met had a tape recorder. What if the Russians have a recording of Junior saying something massively stupid, like ""Elect my father and you can have all of the Ukraine back, and no sanctions!"" Such a scenario could explain why Trump is deliberately doing one hurtful thing after another to destroy America, if he is trying to protect his son from exposure."

"But, these scammers are good Rep≈´bics"
"MACRON IS YOUNG, DUMB AND WEARS SKINNY GAY PANTS!"

"Does WaPo have any ability and integrity  to research  this  ""Story"" to see if a crime was commited, and, if so, to provide the evidence,sourced with names, to support that a crime was in fact committed. Or , is it your goal to smear President Trump,  since you know no crime was committed, and then, to seek out, and pounce on the next smear Trump opportunity. Because as now, as of yesterday, and tthe  day before,  you have Zero evidence of Trump -Russia-Putin Collusion-None! WaPo is a disgrace to America, for your  hate for Trump and desire to destroy him vastly exceeds any concern you have for the future of our Republic."
Sven i am not going to keep arguing you are wrong more then you are right. You affliction is you think your thoughts are the only truth there is.
"So far,... Ivanka Trump.. Assistance..will help..women..in Peru..cuba.. Australia..many European nation now under duress, both parents working.. Euro..so depleted!..
Mexican Paso.........Tahiti"
You might as well just keep going until you collapsed Seattle economically. New slogan for you- death to Seattle economy (just because you are curious to see what happens when you raise minimum wages irrationally high rapidly to inflation and tax the ones owned businesses to death) :)
Now that is really FAKE.
