1,"Please tell me no one is surprised by this. This is the same Intel committee  at which  one witnesses (Flynn) took the  5th and other, Trump's own lawyer,  simply blew it off to which there have been no consequences. On what planet where law and order and democracy matter is that considered normal? Are the Republicans really interested in exposing corruption, or just worried their witness may have something compromising and so try to fish it out of them under the pretense of a hearing? My guess; they're on a fishing expedition to beat Mueller to the goods. This is how corrupt they have become: willing to undermine an investigation into a U.S. election sabotaged by a foreign power in order to maintain an installed puppet president."

Why did nobody that knew Trump was not under investigation tell it to the media?
Best kept secret in the government, FBI and DOJ.

And you wonder why Trump is asking for loyalty as everyone and their dog is trying to screw him over.

He showed his colors when he didn't stand up to Loretta Lynch.  If he had come out and said Trump was not under special investigation, would there had been need for a special prosecutor.

1,"UNDERSTANDING
HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA

Over and over and over again we hear the American citizen ask, ""Why is our country the only nation in the industrialized free world that doesn't guarantee free health coverage to its citizens?""

It's because we aren't listening to the ANSWER or maybe because we just find it too difficult if not impossible to believe.  

That answer is, ""Because we are a CAPITALIST society"".   That means we pay for whatever we get. The federal government can't offer us 100% guaranteed free health coverage because that would compete with free enterprise. It would never get past Capitalists. 

In hard, harsh language, as a health care provider in a Capitalistic society, my right to charge you to be able to stay alive at whatever is the cost I choose to impose is greater than your right to stay alive if you can‚Äôt afford it. What's more, that's the LAW; not in those words of course, but it is the LAW.

The bottom line is that in the richest country in the world ‚Äì wealthier still than the next 4 wealthiest countries combined -- we will wreck our savings, sell our homes, beg, borrow, steal -- or die -- in order to get the kind of health coverage we finally achieved under President Obama and which Trump is working overtime to take away from us. Those are the alternatives to health care now facing Americans under this administration because, once again, the insurance company has the right to charge you to be able to stay alive at whatever is the cost it chooses to impose, a right greater than your right to stay alive if you can‚Äôt afford it. 

The ""president"" agrees with this ‚Äúdeath panel‚Äù policy.
So too does the majority of the House. 
So too does the majority of the Senate.
So too will a Justice system imbalanced 5-4 and likely to be soon imbalanced 6-3 or even 7-2.

How in the world did we EVER get here?

I will tell you. On election day you decided to watch World Wide Wrestling instead, or to play some game on your computer. Maybe you just spent the day doing the couch potato. Maybe it looked like rain and you decided not to chance it.

In essence no one really did a thing to you. You committed suicide. Your contribution to changing the status quo was your decision to do nothing.

There are 8,760 hours in a year or 35,040 hours in the 4 years between elections. You need maybe 2 hours to go to town and file for an ID and perhaps another 5 to go vote on a heavier-than-usual election day turn out -- 7 hours total. Round that to 10 hours to allow for a flat tire or a stop at Juan In A Million's for an awesome taco and a beer on the way back from voting. Bottom line, 10 from 35,040 still leaves you 35,030 to do everything else.

I don't care if you hold down 3 jobs, have no car, live 3 miles from the closest bus stop or happen to be sick 95% of those 35,040 hours. You are still left well over 1,000 hours to get an ID and go vote, not to mention you have alternatives that will consume even less time -- such as mailing in your ballot. 

Consider this, that you may instead decide to find a full day to take to the streets later on and participate in a massive protest with 100s of thousands of other protesting citizens, but not a half day or less to go get an ID and vote?

That‚Äôs an excuse looking for a reason to be the poor, helpless victim or more dramatic still, to down a double Prestone Anti-Freeze Margarita. Do Juan In A Million's instead. It is much more satisfying, plus you can STILL take to the streets after the fact to protest -- and maybe even to CELEBRATE, not to mention you'll be healthier, happier and in much better financial condition because you voted."

Besides the insults levelled at me, some pointed out that, given Charlie's current situation, prolonging the inevitable is tantamount to child abuse.

I still find it deeply unsettling that a court can overrule parental rights and decide that a person, in this case a baby, should die."

1,Insanity. So sorry for the innocent people harmed.
1,"Remember that lovely little ""assessment"" report released to congress and the press breaking the ""proof"" of Russian interference? Barely a moment was spent describing the supposed proof, more time was spent on what is an ""assessment"" or ""judgment"", how they reach assessments or judgments, and how they rate these assessments and judgments.

But the majority of the report was actually dedicated to showing that RT was an arm of Russian government propaganda.  The report even went so far as to detail examples of what they call ""propaganda"" including:

RT covered Occupy Wall Street and came to the conclusion that Wall Street is greedy.  Who woulda known?!

RT covered fracking and said it was bad for the environment. Scandalous!

RT coverage questioned the integrity of U.S. elections because of the undue influence in big money in our political system. Hmmm...didn't we have a candidate who basically ran their campaign on this topic?  And drew tens of thousands to hear that message, filling stadium after stadium to overflowing? Oh yeah...I think his name was Bernie.

And most egregious of all, the straw that must have broken the back of the voters in the U.S. and affected the election, thus proving Russian meddling, RT actually had the audacity to give coverage to the third-party presidential candidate debates.  How could they?  How dastardly!

These and more were listed in that report as examples of Russian ""propaganda"".

Propaganda my ass. Seems to me like RT was committing actual acts of journalism.  

This is the insane nature of the push to try to prove in some fashion that ""Russia did it"" even though not ONE of our intelligence agencies have actually examined the DNC servers, multiple FBI requests for access having been denied by Debbie and the DNC.

Perhaps they can't hand over the servers because they don't want what is in them to become available as potential evidence in the ongoing class-action civil-suit against Debbie and the DNC for defrauding U.S. donors to a Democratic party that claimed it was running an equal platform for ALL Democratic presidential candidates when they had no intent of backing anyone but Hillary.

There would also surely be more evidence in there of the pervasive and egregious election fraud committed on behalf or at the behest of Hillary in the primaries.

As well there may be evidence of The Clinton Foundation involvement in essentially laundering donations for Hillary's use in the campaign. To my knowledge, there is STILL an ongoing investigation into the Clinton Foundation as well, noting the closure of one of their main means of fundraising, the Clinton Global Initiative.

Or maybe there simply isn't any evidence of Russia hacking, which would mean the DNC emails were leaked, and the question then turns to ""Who LEAKED the emails, and attention will swing right back on to Seth Rich and his ongoing murder investigation.

Regardless of whether there is proof of any Russian interference or not the fact remains that Debbie and the DNC refused access to those servers, and NO ONE, not Debbie, not the DNC, not John Podesta, not even Hillary, are asking that the servers be examined so the truth can be known.  Even IF there were actual proof of Russian interference there, which I seriously doubt, that they have not relinquished those servers makes it plain to see they are hiding something in those servers.  To not hand over the evidence to do what they so badly desire, which is to take down Trump and Russia simultaneously, it is obvious that they are hiding some thing, or things.

We must subpoena and examine those servers, not to look for evidence of Russian hacking or interference, but to look into the evidence of ANY improprieties or illicit activities on ANY party or party's part, from the beginning of the primaries to the end of the general election. 

And until that happens, until our intelligence agencies actually have their hands on those servers and whatever proof they hold, instead of relying on the ""assessment"" of a third-party cyber-security firm employed BY the DNC, and until they transparently release solid proof of such meddling, I am calling the ""Russia did it"" narrative complete bullshit, a political move aimed at demonizing Russia to sway American sentiment in favor of expanded perpetual war for the sake of profit, power over, and regime change's sake. And such ugly brinksmanship might even put us in a shooting war WITH Russian, a major nuclear power.  These are dangerous lies in a dangerous game they are playing, a game where OUR propaganda machine keeps telling us ""Russia, Russia, Russia."" They've got nothing on the skill of our propagandizers!"

In a motion filed by the state after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated portions of the ban on June 26, Attorney General Doug Chin argued that the Trump administration wrongly excluded grandparents and other relatives from the list of family members who can obtain visas to travel to the United States."
