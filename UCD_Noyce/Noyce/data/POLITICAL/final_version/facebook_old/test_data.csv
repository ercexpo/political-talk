1,I thought this was gonna be linguistical and stuff then i got tangents about black tie affairs and the drug war. Weird...
1,Are you as hateful and as dishonest as you appear?  Will you stoop at nothing to  insert fear in the uneducated and misinformed?  I guess you are stuck in a job that dictates your agenda.  Too bad you have no mind of your own and resort to lies and inuendos.   You are truly a failure at any attempt to be a journalist.
0,Used to ?  Seems like that is exactly what he is doing here.
1,"I'm sorry but when more then half the country is upset with the way you are doing it your way, is that still ""for the people?"""
1,how about you be a true american and tell the FBI about it as soon as it happened?‚Ä¶..IMPEACH.
1,"Remember when Donald Trump was business partners with the Russian government and his company got 53 million from the Russian government investment fund called Rusnano that was started by Vladimir Putin and is referred to as ""Putin's Child""?

Oh wait, that wasn't Trump it was John Podesta.

Remember when Donald Trump received 500 thousand for a speech in Moscow and paid for by Renaissance Capital, a company tied to Russian Intelligence Agencies?

Oh wait, that was Bill Clinton.

Remember when Donald Trump approved the sale of 20% of US uranium to the Russians while he was Secretary of State which gave control of it to Rosatom the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation?

Oh wait, that was Hillary Clinton.

Remember when Donald Trump lied about that and said he wasn't a part of approving the deal that gave the Russians 1/5 of our uranium, but then his emails were leaked showing he did lie about it?

Oh wait, that was Hillary Clinton and John Podesta.

Remember when Donald Trump got 145 million dollars from shareholders of the uranium company sold to the Russians?

Oh wait, that was Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.

Remember when Donald Trump accepted millions in donations from Russian Oligarchs like the chairman of a company that's part of the Russian Nuclear Research Cluster, the wife of the mayor of Moscow, and a close pal of Putins?

Oh wait, that was the Clinton Foundation.

Remember when Donald Trump failed to disclose all those donations before becoming the Secretary of State, and it was only found out when a journalist went through Canadian tax records?

Oh wait, that was Hillary Clinton.

Remember when Donald Trump told Mitt Romney that the 80s called and it wanted its Russian policy back. The Cold War is over?

Oh wait, that was President Obama.

Man... Trump's ties to Russia are really disgusting!"
1,"Awesome! The stock market is crashing too!  Plus, we have a treason trial coming up soon.  Maybe they will put Big Sugar Daddy T and jr. in the same cell."
1,"When children are growing up, it's the responsibility parents to guide them. Children at an early age don't know one gender from the other. If a child is an only child, the discovery of gender differences may come later. If, on the other hand there's male and female children, the question may come earlier... they will recognize the difference. My advice!... answer their gender questions with common sense."
1,"I suggest that you stick with your day job--disguising as a journalist! Did you have any classes in journalism? It would have been nice if you would have had perhaps ONE in journalistic ethics? They msy not even exist today, but I think they did back in the 70's? Keep doing what you seem to do best--spread misinformation and throwing vulger insults at your enemies and opponents! Your show and most of MEDIA today is a disgrace and has evolved to even lower than Tabloid News like the National Enquirer--and even they at least were honest about who they are and never misled people into thinking they were a Real News Organization!"

1,"Clearly the solution to the problem is that the University needed to provide mo money for dem programs. That would solve the imaginary ""bigotry"" and stop the students from engaging in neverending ""protests"" right? 

Yes, I'm sure just a bit more money for dem programs will do it!"
1,"feel sorry for the parents, but they need to listen to the hospital and stop ignoring their advice at this point, that american pastor is just a parasite taking advantage of vulnerable people to further his awful views"
1,"if gender is a social construct...

1,"Just watching the election, and seeing what a rude, arrogant, childish, jerk he was to Hillary & others, was a major red flag to me. I find him obnoxious & absurd. He might have a couple of decent qualities, but on the whole...NO. It is beyond believable, that so many people voted for him anyway, seeing the same characteristics that I did. Boggles the mind. There were/are so many more qualified people than him, and some people would rather have a celebrity/reality star, with a obnoxious personality, than someone who is an experienced person who knows how things work in the world. Nauseating...."
1,"There's also the anti-scientist beliefs of the religious right, and while not all self-proclaimed Christian politicians actually believe the nonsense they're spouting, they are pandering to their base of creationist-dominionists."

1,I don't think it's fair to deny a plea deal just because the judge thinks lawyers are lazy and he misses out on media attention during trial.
0,Love ya Lawrence.
1,Canadian here...I can tell you that MOST of us are pissed and disgusted. He was a product of his environment. His parents were proven to be radicals involved with  Al-Qaeda and the mosque he attended preached to that effect.These people were the ones who put him in that situation and therefor the ones he should be suing....NOT the Canadian Tax Payers.

1,"KILL THEM ALL , and let GOD sort them out !!! The only good muslim is a DEAD muslim !!!"
1,"It's always amusing when someone says ""it's not about me"", when in actuality, it's all about them. In case no one told you why your opening question for Mr. Trump in the first debate was so very unprofessional and rude, it's because you were letting it be known that you ( and FOX ) believed Trump had no business being on that stage. Mr Trump was very gracious to help you with your ratings tonight. I hope you thanked him profusely, because it's not all about you."

1,"Mean to anyone who isn't rich and white.  Trump says he won't hire anyone who isn't rich.  Rich, white and vicious is the way is the only way to be.  The rest of us are chumps."
0,"There was no ""leak"" as the bigger an investigation gets, the more people that get interviewed and the more people who know about what's happening. This president is so worried about his own personal criminal liability that he caused an investigation's expansion to include him for possible criminal conduct. My question is what does he have to hide? Other than his narcissistic personality being unable to cope with the narrow margin of his win and the fact that the Russians helped him get there, he shouldn't have to worry about the investigation when it comes to his own personal culpability. Unless, again, he is trying to cover up to keep the facts from coming out. The harder he tries, the guiltier he looks."
1,"My son is seriously thinking about abandoning his University course, because he's terrified of the debt it will leave him in! So we're now going back into the two tear system, those who can afford & those who cannot! That kind of interest is so wrong & the ¬£21,000 to start paying back is crazy because depending one where they live they will not be able to afford to go to work!! Totally ridiculous!"

1,"Trump's base will run with any conspiracy he puts forward. The trick is to find one that is so ludicrous no one could believe it, then mock liberals by saying we republicans believe every word Trump puts forward though they know it's unbelievable.

What if the Russians have a recording of Junior saying something massively stupid, like ""Elect my father and you can have all of the Ukraine back, and no sanctions!"" Such a scenario could explain why Trump is deliberately doing one hurtful thing after another to destroy America, if he is trying to protect his son from exposure."
