A handset / hand held device which can perform on the best speed possible when it comes to CPU 'n GPU (Samsung/Apple flagships), a battery that can make a dent like 5100 mah (Lenovo did it long back ""P2""), 120 Hz panel (Razor proved it!), Speakers (Razor again!), but with the things that haven't been figured out yet or maybe I'm not aware such as Palm/touch rejection,  temp control (Liquid metal is a start!), anti-sweat panel/back panel (Extremely specific for few users out there) and maybe even wireless display connectivity/speaker system for home use.

Even if it was designed to be one, it doesn't matter within the context of the universe itself.  It's not considered a dragon within its own universe, so it can't be considered a dragon for this list.  Although that does mean that Fin Fang Foom also doesn't count, but a lot of people are already complaining about that choice for that very reason."

1,"The House of Colonna hold the continual position of Prince Assistants to the Papal Throne at the Vatican. They claim to be the Julio-Claudian dynasty of ancient Rome and directly descend from Peter de Columna and the Counts of Tusculum. Cologne Germany was named Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium named for the Julio-Claudian family. The Colonna family use the column on their coat of arms which is a symbol for political power. The Colonna name derives from the Greek word kolona which means a column. The Columbus and Colombo names also derive from Columna and from Peter de Columna. Christopher Columbus was a relative of the Colonna family and he claimed America for Rome. Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa and was funded by the Doria banking family who are intermarried with the House of Colonna. America is named after Amerigo Vespucci an Italian explorer working for the House of Medici. Amerigo Vespucci created the term New World for the Americas. Novus Ordo Seclorum is Latin and means New Order of the Ages and is on the US dollar and US great seal. The Vatican City State is the only nation on the planet that uses Latin as an official language.

The Colonna's control the Colombo crime family and several Jewish mafia factions which also run Hollywood and Columbia Pictures for Black Nobility like the House of Colonna. They also have majority ownership over the Chicago Outfit. The House of Colonna control the Knights of Columbus which uses the Roman fasces symbol for its logo. There are many police officers and federal agents that are members of the Knights of Columbus. The Colonna family have influence over police and organized crime. The Five Families are covert business enterprises for the Italian Nobility and they use their mafia to blackmail politicians. Prince Prospero Colonna di Stigliano is the current head of the Stigliano branch and his wife Princess Frances Colonna. The Colonna family come from Alba Longa and established a branch in Salamanca Spain known as the Dukes of Alba which merged with the FitzJames family of England. Salamanca uses the column on its flag where the Dukes of Alba ruled. Diego Columbus marriedÂ Maraa de Toledo of the House of Alba. The Colonna family are also related to theÂ Coloma family of Spain which settled in Belgium as powerful counts and landowners.

Prince Guido Colonna di Paliano was a Commissioner of the European Union, Italian Vice Consul to New York City and a member of the Trilateral Commission. Jerry Colonna is a financier from New York City who helped to establish Silicon Valley. Jerry Colonna who is believed to be worth over 50 million started a small investment group called Flatiron Partners which was in the business of making billions for companies like JP Morgan Chase. Jerry Colonna is protected by organized crime which attack me whenever I mention him. Jerry Colonna appears to be used for handling their illegal transactions and for money laundering. The Colonna family came from Alba in Rome and Saint Albans was one of their agents who settled in Saint Albans name after him in England. The Roman Alban clan later created the Barons Romney that established themselves about 100 miles away from Saint Albans. The name Romney means Roman. The Colonna family ceremonially rule over Capitoline Hill which represents the political power of Rome's corporate empire.

The column symbolizes the political support that maintains their claim to governmental land ownership. Freemasonry uses two pillars or columns in their temples for the two Colonna princely lines of Stigliano and Paliano. Paliano comes from the Latin word Palus meaning a stake or support like a pillar. The Colonna family also intermarried with the Barberini papal nobility which use bees on their coat of arms. The Mormon Church was created by Freemasons from New York and Mormonism uses bees and beehives as a common symbol. Mitt Romney is a powerful Mormon and politician. Romney means Roman. Washington DC is Roman architecture and has the Roman fasces symbol all over US federal buildings and US seals. Fascism means a centralization of power. Capitol Hill is named after Capitoline Hill in Rome. Washington DC was called Rome in 1669. Members of the Colonna crime family include Prince Prospero Colonna di Stigliano, Prince Stefano Colonna di Stigliano, Prince Oddone Colonna, Prince Prospero Colonna di Paliano, Prince Marcantonio Colonna di Paliano, Prince Urbano Riario Sforza Barberini Colonna di Sciarra, Princess Frances Colonna di Stigliano, Jerry Colonna, and Stefano Colonna from the University of Milan who developed the Julia-Colonna Epoxidation process used in vaccines. Prince Prospero of Stigliano and Prince Marcantonio of Paliano are the heads of this Roman clan."

Also, I have a different interpretation. People want to sleep with rockstars and athletes, I don't hear very much about women flocking to tech billionaires or anything like that. Though I'm sure they could find someone that wants to be taken care of. If it was acceptable for men to do the same, more men would do it as well as more women become rich.

So why would I prefer lawyers to bullet-proof a bill ? Because of Legaleese. Politicians use their own lingo, but when one wants to circumvent a legal constraint, one gets a lawyer.
It looks a lot like Ro-Sham-Bo. Politician speak is often vague enough to bore loopholes in many texts. Legaleese is technical, precise, strives to eliminate double entendre and incertitudes ; Legaleese wins. My theoretical politician would hire the most vicious lawyers he/she could find to make his/her bill as unassailable, as unambiguous, as self sufficient, as rhetorically inert as possible.

The only terrorists I see outside my door are the cops, maybe they are the regular ISIS for all I know. But I heard Gavin Seim call the cops ""Blue ISIS"" and knowing they are in fact terrorists, and that ISIS is a much used term for terrorists, I picked that up from him. You should check out his channel. 

The combined agencies of the city police, county sheriffs, and state HWP troopers are the largest terrorist gang in the world. And the only terrorists I see with my own eyes, robbing, raping, abusing, abduction, extorting and yes, there are no shortage of murders on their hands. For goodness sakes! these cops murdered Dillon Taylor because they couldn't stand to see him enjoying music, then mocked, joked and laughed at the grieving friends and family at an event to morn his loss.

1,"Your point is the US makes and sells weapons and that is the reality of the situation, which does provide a decent source of income for the nation. I don't even disagree with that, because it isn't like the US hasn't done that in the past and it will continue to do so into the future. Weapons exist, so someone has to make and sell them. How am I doing so far? Has your assumption paid off yet?

Before I go on I'll just remark that I always take TYT with a grain of salt, because frankly they're a little too overtly bias for the left and I've seen them make errors. I do consider myself a leftist, probably farther left than most. Regardless I want accurate information, not preaching to the choir. 

Now that we have that out of the way. You seem to be asserting that they are saying that making weapons is bad and they should not be sold to other countries because weapons are evil anti-flower loving things blah blah blah, and that is their argument against Trump in this case. But, nothing like that is ever said throughout the video, there's nothing about denying the reality that the US makes arms and sell those arms. The main point brought up is not being a moron by having the oversight of those sales done by a department that doesn't have the experience required to determine whether or not those weapons are going to someone who could be a potential threat out of a short-sighted desire to sell more of them.

And then the slightly more subjective point of how sad it is that Trump is going around trying to sell weapons to people like a door to door salesman who gets the door slammed in his face half the time because he's desperate for approval. But like I said, that's pretty subjective and not of any significant substance.  

So in summery, selling weapons is a reality that exists, and that's fine. Just be smart about it. And... you're ugly. Or something, since apparently personal appearance seems to somehow add value to an argument according to you."

You think you have a coherent framework, but all you have is your own opinions. The 2nd amendment is ambiguous enough that many differing federal laws can be enacted while still upholding the 2nd amendment.

Tell me, what arms should be regulated? If you start there, then I'll entertain a conversation.

If you want to pretend all arms should be legal, then why doesn't The Walton Family or George Soros have the right to purchase a nuclear weapon?

Perhaps you interpret the word ""bear"" to mean: able to carry on ones body.
But dirty bombs are able to be carried on ones own body. So should those be legal? Why or why not?

Notice, the 2nd amendment does not mention fire arms or guns, just arms."

When the SJW's and racists on the left start talking about microaggressions and safe spaces, where you think you can strip someone else of their basic human rights just to satisfy your ""Feelings"", you nutjobs end up sounding just as delusional as this Eqyptian lawyer.  People talking about punching nazi's, and attacking trump supporters, having dorms that exclude whites, having black-only graduations at College.....  Congrats, both the left and the right have reached a level playing field of extremism, violence and racism.

And in all the stupidity since Trump got elected, the left has ended up making a lot of conservative personalities end up lookign reasonable, and pushed liberals more to the right of the political spectrum.

The left destroyed their own base, forgot what being an actual LIBERAL meant, and turned into a bunch of ideological extremists, basing everything off identity politics, reversing the progress of race relations, and treating people SPECIFICALLY based on their race, and sex, and creating a progressive stack - the left turned into the racist equivalent of conservatives on the far right.
