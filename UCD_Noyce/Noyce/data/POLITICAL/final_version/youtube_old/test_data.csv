Sometimes I wear shorts or a very short dress because itâ€™s hot outside and I want to be as cool & comfortable as possible. Not because I want to sexualize my body and my look, and certainly not because I want random strangers to compliment or touch me. So, no, women donâ€™t always want to dress a certain way in order to be sexualized. When you see someone who looks super sexy itâ€™s fine to think â€œwow theyâ€™re sexyâ€ but you donâ€™t have the right to touch them in any way. Simple, really.

Nafta spurred economic growth as the US was ramping up to profit off its implementation, but as the policy matured the result was clear, Wall St profits would go up and wages and benefits would go down."

Your gotta remember that Hillary was saying No Fly Zone over Syria during the election, and those of us paying attention to such things, which includes Assange, knew what that meant from Libya."
1,"luv cheney Wow, that's a reach just for a conspiracy/""the south will rise again"" type theory. We are taught lies? You're arguing semantics about secession, and whether it makes the rebel stars and bars traitorous to display? I'll point out one thing, under the eyes of the Union, when Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation it applied to ""all"" slaves in the secessionist states as well. Your trying to make an argument that the Confederacy was making after seceding. Because they wanted to be seen as a new nation. They weren't before that, it was all a ploy to keep they're slaves and not have to adhere to Federal Government. Get over it, they lost, so if you want to believe that way, fine.....that's the way it was, until the Union was re-united. See, the government never recognized the Confederacy as a nation, that's why it was treasonous. All you needed to say was, it isn't treasonous to display the flag in your own private property."

0,"So the problems with my argument is things I never wrote, we don't know what happened behind the scenes so as far as we know the overreaction isn't on the part of Swift.

Secondly you're basically saying that if you receive a false label then if you're not careful with your response (thou doth protest too much) or not respond at all then that makes the label true paying no attention to the guy spreading falsehoods. No, its still false.

Taylor Swift shouldn't have to respond to me if for example I make a video claiming that her music videos are full of satanic imagery that compels people to murder the elderly, any articles paying any credence to my video without supporting evidence isn't journalism but mere click seeking and that should be the real story not Swift's lawyer doing his or her job."
