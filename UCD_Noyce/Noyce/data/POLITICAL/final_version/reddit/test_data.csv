0,"Here is an excellent [article](http://www.dogstardaily.com/training/more-bite-inhibition-because-its-so-important) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vrPDMc-I-k) on teaching your dog bite inhibition. I would be cautious with the other replies on this thread (but I *completely* understand where they are coming from), because if you *stop* the biting before she has learned to inhibit her bite, then, considering that she is drawing blood 25% of the time, she could do some serious damage if she ever feels the need to bite out of fear."

From what you've said and the other reply, it sounds like it is the ratio that's not agreed with me. The ones I've liked have been 50/50 and either 12mg, 15mg or 18mg. I thought it was just the higher nicotine content that was producing that effect. As you said, it really is a horrible experience and you are left to deal with it if you haven't got a supply like I did.

I wanted to get to the bottom of it because I feel like I'm stuck to buying what I know is ok and not expanding out to other vendors. If I've found 50/50 to be ok, is that something I can stick to or do I need to consider other variables?"

Meanwhile, we have the ""Deedeereddit"" channel in-game for all the newbros to ask questions, which stays pretty active and chatty talking about all sorts of things, sometimes just shooting the breeze, other times talking through how to spiral in on an enemy so your frigate isn't turned to dust in a couple seconds.

0,"Not OP, but I worked at scout camp for a couple of years. I can verify that yes, the LDS scouts were the worst. I can't really speculate on what the core cause was, but many of the scouts just didn't give *a fuck*. They were their because they had to be there, and so they didn't really put in any effort. Couple this with leaders whose goal is to push the kids through a crapton of merit badges as fast as possible to get them to eagle and you have a poisonous combination.

The leader's control every aspect of the scouts' life at camp. They control what merit badges they go to. They control what activities they attend, they control what formation the scouts march in, the boys don't get a say in any of that, and so naturally they feel stuck and frustrated. And frustrated boys do destructive things.

If the LDS kids *chose* to go to scouts and *chose* to attend scout camp, then I'm sure teaching them would be easier than it was. But instead we get kids who don't want to be there, so they just goof off. I can't tell you how many times I had to go ""pay attention, when you are up at the rock wall you *will* need to know this knot in order to, you know, not die.""

Now I'm not saying *all* LDS troops are like this, but there are far more bad LDS troops than there are bad non-LDS troops. Most of our staff came from non-LDS backgrounds, and the staff is made up of serious scouters, people who want to be there because they truly love the organization. In fact the LDS staffers were frequently (but not always) the most difficult to deal with.

Anyway, still enjoyed my time I spent at scout camp. Some of the best summers of my life."
1,"Yeah. They would. To the borrower, a loan is a liability obviously, but to the lender, be it a bank or any other lending institution, the loan is an *asset.* Wipe out the loan, and you wipe out the asset portfolio of every single lending institution on the planet. That means instant insolvency, and with *every* lending institution insolvent, there would be none left to take over the liabilities of the failed institutions â€¦ meaning the *deposits* those institutions have on their books.

In most economies there's a safety net that guarantees, with government funds, the deposits held by a failed bank, but guess what wiping out all debt in the world would also do? That's right. It'd wipe out all government funds. Every treasury on the planet, be it national or municipal or what, would vanish in a flash, meaning that depository-insurance safety net also vanishes in a flash.

And in fact, since every single monetary unit on the planet â€” dollars, pounds, whatever â€” is backed by debt, wiping out all the debt would erase *all money* from existence. Not just the contents of your bank account and your government's treasury, but also the *very banknotes in your pocket* would be worthless, because they wouldn't be backed by anything. If anybody chose to accept them as payment for a good or service, it'd be pure coincidence, and a dumb move on the part of the seller, frankly.

To say that wiping out all debt would cause every economy on the planet to collapse isn't going far enough. The economies wouldn't simply *collapse.* They'd *cease to exist.* Poof. Gone. We're back to barter, unless and until somebody establishes a new monetary unit and starts taking on new debt."

>Bayernâ€™s current leading goalscorer Mario Gomez (26) has pledged his long-term future to the club. The Germany international, who has 37 goals to his name in 41 matches this season, has inked a new deal keeping him at FCB until 30 June 2016, after agreeing the terms of a contract extension with the FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen AG board of directors.

>â€œAs Iâ€™ve always said, FC Bayern is a magnificent club, where I feel good and where I believe I have the best sporting perspective, so Iâ€™m delighted weâ€™ve agreed a contract extension,â€ commented Gomez, â€œIâ€™m convinced weâ€™re set for great things here in the years to come. I want to play my part in that.â€œ

>â€œIn recent years, Mario Gomez has developed into one of Europeâ€™s best strikers,â€ said Bayern director of sport Christian Nerlinger, â€œweâ€™re delighted heâ€™ll continue to score his goals for FC Bayern. Weâ€™ve now concluded contract extensions with Mario and other current internationals, securing a long-term foundation for FC Bayern over the coming years.â€

I've already replaced some of our yard with low water plants and succulents, but I just don't have the funds to fully landscape our place now.

Lawns require mowing and fertilizing, yes, but not a lot of thought. Succulents take a little finesse and need protection from overwatering/sunburn/frost.

Those GPUs are cut from a big silicon wafer, then tested. If the chip passes all tests, its branded as a top GPU (GTX 680/HD 7970 Ghz). If it fails, some capabilities are turned off and tested again. If it passes this time, its branded the next tier (GTX 670 etc) and so on.

So, if you are lucky, you could get a chip that passed all tests with a lot of headroom, and if you are unlucky, you can get a chip that barely passed them. Nevertheless, both GPUs will be branded the same. That's the lottery."

Furthermore, anybody who started reading Harry in the first couple years of his popularity would have aged 7-10 years by the time the last book came out, and 11-15 years by the release of the last movie. So yeah, they should definitely be aimed at 9-year-olds forever.

That said, I think 5-7 (because Goblet of Fire is more of a stepping stone between 1-3 and 5-7) were pretty well-balanced between the demographic toward which they were aimed. They were darker, yes, but not exactly more adult-oriented. I mean there was no sex of any sort and very little outright murder or extreme violence (Snape's death, Sectumsempra and Nagini's kills being all I can think of, but correct me if I am wrong) that wasn't by magic. Twilight has more overtly adult themes than Harry Potter, to be honest."

0,If you stand up right your an easy target to knock out of position. If you bend forward the goalie will push you from behind and you will end up being a nice shot blocker. Find a nice place in between that gives you lots of balance so you don't end up on the ice. Make sure your bending at the knees and your body is somewhat upright. Don't bend over like an old man. Goalies will stand up on long cycles to conserve energy but once there is enough traffic going on or they read the play and know the puck is coming they get pretty low in their stance so you don't need to be that tall.

0,"Bittorrent clients (specially qbittorrent) communicate a lot with untrusted nodes and also write files you'll eventually click/execute. This can be exploited by a remote attacker to gain complete access to your whole system. It is much more convenient for the attacker, when you run it as root, because even a minor security hole that usually would only allow him to do things with the user the bittorrent client is running as, will now let him do things being root.

An example: If an attacker makes your client write an executable and set its permissions, normally, this would let him execute malicious software with the privileges of your user account, as soon as you click it. However, if he is able to write it as root, he can set the set UID bit, so even when you click on it with your non-root user account, it would be launched with root privileges and the attacker can use it to manipulate system settings / install malware he normally could not.

This is one of the things that were criticized about windows for a long time: You had to be Administrator to do a lot of trivial things, because it was so inconvenient to launch only specific applications with different user accounts. This is a lot easier on GNU/Linux, BSD, etc.. So there usually is no need to run userspace applications being root, if they were intended to, they would make use of set UID and also should drop privileges as soon as they did all the system things (for example, a web server that needs root access to get to use port 80 should drop it afterwards for security reasons)."

0,"Nothing wrong with enlisting instead of applying to OCS -- you get to push the age limit back by at least 2 years as well, and applying from the fleet is mostly the same process with a few extra steps.  One of the toughest things about applying to OCS is the long process, and we can't even guarantee selection (so you could wait a while and then still might not get picked up).

Assuming medical clearance, I think that you would have a decent shot at SWO or NFO though, as scoring a 99 means that you would probably do pretty well on the OAR part of the test at least.  The test score for officers never expires, so you can always take the test before shipping, and then use that score in an application down the road. 

If you do decide to apply for officer after enlisting, you will want to basically be a superstar at your first command, get qualified as fast as possible, and take on extra responsibilities outside your immediate ones (even better if they are outside your division as well).  You may find that you really enjoy your job and don't want to apply for officer anyways.

TLDR:  In your situation I think that enlisting is a great idea."
0,"That's what I'm thinking as well, but I don't know how much weight my opinion has on the matter, since I'm almost entirely unfamiliar with new games. I think the only way someone could get me to truly enjoy any game beyond, say, the 5th gen, would be if it had LoK-level dialogue."

Prior to putting the lenses in the case, make sure that you clean the lens before placing it in the solution. Place the lens in the palm of your hand and place a couple drops of solution in it. Then *gently* rub both sides of the lens. This will ensure that you remove all protein and other residues.

0,"[throwaway / second account because I want to keep this stuff from my main account history]

So, this is my story:

I went to Asia for the last 2,5 years. I really liked it there so I thought I'd do a language course, because why not. Travels to Asia made me want to live there for at least a while, because I think life's too short to stay for the whole time of it in only one place. Next goal is China by the way.

So I met this girl in the language course. She's 12 years older than I am but we came along pretty well. We started writing to each other for some time and it went great. Her work is near my University so we get to meet each other every other day which is nice. 

Now 3 weeks ago I tried to make first moves in her direction. Our talks with each other started to be more personal. The atmosphere feels quite flirty between us, at least for me. Now I started talking about my ideas of leaving this country, live the dream of starting a life somewhere else. She's more of a person to stay in one place, and I can understand that but it's not for me. Not in this phase of my life. At least for now. I think here started the first differences between us. I'm at an age where I want to explore the world and see how far I can go and she's starting to feel the need for a more stable environment and stay in one place. 

We talked pretty much about this and I think that's what has made her a little bit unsure about us. 

So a view days ago, I said fuck it and asked her ""if there is anything going on between us"". She said she really likes me, but we don't match... And I agreed. The rational part of me was relieved and said:""Yes, she's right. And you won't do yourself a favor if you get yourself in an emotional dependence on her"". But the other part of me is helplessly in love. And I mean really bad in love. I can't sleep anymore. I can't think straight for a second without thinking about her. I only feel happy when I hear about her or when I'm near her. I really, really want to be just near her. I never had this before. Like my body is in actual physical pain when I can't be around her. It's bad BAD. Really BAD. 

So I'm in this situation now where I can't go back and forth. We still write each other. And as friends we come along great. But now I'm in this horrible emotional pain feeling like I made a huge mistake I can't get around. I feel like constant crying to give me some relief but it won't happen. I'm just staring at Reddit, listening to music and waiting for the time to pass. My whole body is shutting down, waiting for her next message, give me my next little fix of her attention. 

And I can't simply help it. She's such a great person. She's so indescribable beautiful. And she has such a wonderful character. I have this absurd fascination about her, it's crazy.I want to be near her. Make her feel good. Cuddle and kiss her. Stroke through her wonderful long hair. 

So what do I do now? My last resort is to just tell her:""Okay, so this is the situation, I'm absolutely in love with you. What do we do now?"" I'm pretty sure she won't be answering my feelings. Maybe even for my own sake from her point of view. And that would be okay. I wont be mad at her or give her the fault of not loving me back. 

But there is still the problem of me being this terrible lovesick teenager. I'm not functioning right now and I don't know how to go on. 

Please help me! It's 4 am right now and writing down here what goes through my head was the last idea I had. I already told some close friends what's happening but they don't have much of an advice either. 

So what do I do now?

0,"Disclaimer: I haven't dealt with Windows VPNs in years, so I don't know if this is still the case.

Not a disclaimer: Don't use your DC as a VPN server. It will be painful and you will have difficulty getting support from Microsoft if you ever need it.

When a client connects to a VPN on a Windows server, the server will assign it an IP and then route traffic to that IP as necessary. If the Windows server is configured for dynamic DNS, it will also register the IP it assigns under the server's hostname.

This will effectively multi-home your server. There's nothing inherently wrong with multi-homing a DC, but you would need to ensure that the DC is either listening on all of the IPs that clients may use to communicate with it, or you will need to manually define your DC's DNS records."

0,">  I think this is shown in the begining of the first paragraph, it doesn't make sense,

Hmmm... I think it makes sense to be honest. Let me use a crude metaphor. Let's say I was a bent stick. I can either see myself as a stick, kinda useless, a bit crooked, my bark falling off. Or I can realize I'm a branch on a beautiful tree. No longer am I a stick, now I'm a branch on this perfectly straight, tall, luscious tree. I no longer feel inadequate (not empty but full), I'm no longer old and tattered, now I have full foliage, I'm no longer just a little stick but a gigantic tree (plentiful).

Yet as a branch of the tree, I may not have the same concerns. Now my concern is being part of the tree, I don't worry about catching rain or the sun - the leaves do that. So I am uncertain, I need faith in the rest of the tree that it will support me. But that's OK.

So the sage sees this in nature and embraces it as his model. He's uncertain in all these things, but still thrives - but only by letting go of his individuality. By *surrendering* himself to the tree.

My main character is American but I am Australian so I had some complaints about grammar as I made her say a few things Americans wouldn't (for example - apparently Americans don't say 'towards' - they say 'toward'). I got an American friend to edit it for me after I realised this, and I thought I'd reuploaded over the old one, but apparently the first one is still the one up for sale so the grammar errors are still there. I suppose I could pay a professional to edit it for me but I just don't have the money.

The second thing I noticed about Indie publishing versus the big guys - my book came out at the same time Josephine Angelini's Starcrossed came out, and boy did her publisher saturate the media with it. The exposure they gave to that book was incredible. In some ways I think mine road on the back of that (people googling 'Starcrossed' may have come across mine too), but just the amount of hoopla they generated on the release of the book made my simple attempts at publicizing my book seem like a drop in the ocean in comparison!

Still, I do believe, if done right, indie publishing is the way of the future."

With that caveat, I'll give a couple of ideas. Obviously, with a worker owned and operated media, advertisers won't be a concern, so the spread of pro-communist propaganda should actively be sought. As long as that comes with education about the failures of past and current socialist projects, that is.

And then I'd like to see a decentralized platform that doesn't use meritocracy as it's basis, instead opting for a more local approach to news so as to keep people informed about what will most affect their daily lives.

Maybe a worker curated global news section as well, so that the working class will have knowledge of global affairs without the imperialist direction of oligarchal forces.

And I don't know, I guess a communist-moderated meritocracy for memes would probably be fine, so that we can still get the best serotonin hits without the fear-mongering, social capital, or outrage. Oh, and so that right-wingers can't use the platform for propaganda, or recruit and create extremists.

TL;DR

Decentralized, worker moderated news, both local and global, but with more emphasis on the local since a lot of global news nowadays is xenophobia. And keep the memes."

1,"I think the left is in an arrogant,  power drunk ascendency,  never seeing itself in the shoes of the Girondins only those of the Jacobins.

The first is the extreme of the corporate-state which will bite away every chunk of autonomy from them until it's too late and either murdering them or relegating them to shame and psychological dismemberment. This will be the demise of the cocksure upper middle class white liberal now stoking the fires of racial hatred and division all the while believing he is not a bigot. The other monster, which is less likely but just as frightening could be a rightwing strongman,  who, no longer bounded by the promise of liberty and infused with the collective consent of the white liberal's targets will be used to ruthlessly punish and psychologically dismember this individual. His enemies won't be white rednecks but a former middle class , bitter from its stolen future and it will make no distinction on race. Everyone will suffer. Still, the smug white liberal will find the same enemy in the authoritarian strongman as does the white nationalist,  who will be put to death at the side of the road. The right doesn't care about race the way the left does. It will be a strange irony. It doesn't have to be this way, and it should not, but as the left continues to push and people of good faith on the right and in the middle are banished from public life they will seek a monster. The smug leftist needs to pick his poison because what he's creating right now is awful , either way. I'll add that any of us who think the rightwing monster will treat us well is in for a surprise."

I honestly didn't get to watch him this season, but I saw him show up in the box scores, and her per36 stats and percentage is impressive. 

I'm guess that most of his shots are within a meter of the basket, but even so, it looks like he's the kind of guy who knows his role. 

And he averaged more offensive boards than he does missed field goals, so that means he's essentially scoring on more than 100% of the shot opportunities he's given (which is to say that his offensive boards wipe away all of his missed FGs and then some). 

But he better be careful, because in three or four years, he could be getting the Andre Drummond treatment from this sub. ;-)"

So, at least where I live, I would emphasise (as comrade /u/jshrdd_ said below) physical fitness first, and then martial arts second.

I would prefer to avoid escalating to armed conflict until it cannot be avoided. The fascists here are largely unarmed. Some will carry blunt instruments (flick bats, etc), and the rare one will carry a knife. 

If I lived in the US, I would advocate for the left to have an organised military capacity for self-defence, but to refrain from *using* arms unless absolutely necessary.

I think there's a thin line to tread between fetishing force and excessive pacifism.

In the long term, though, violent revolution (or reaction) cannot be avoided."

One example is a lot of people say Censorship was a problem, but that's only in places that never experienced a 'liberal' period in their social period - China and Russia's censorship was completely on par with its historical approach to the problem. Whereas a Socialist USA would hypothetically \*decrease\* its censorship because the religious influence on the FCC would be removed."

1,"I am fully vaccinated and encourage everyone else to do so, but go off chief.  I don't support the government mandating things under the guise of needing hospital capacity because that opens up the possibility of a whole host of other requirements and new powers for the federal or state governments that were not available to them before.

The government does not mandate we eat healthy, stop smoking, don't drink alcohol, etc. - all the while people who do that are reaping the consequences of being unhealthy and clogging up hospitals.  In fact, general unhealthiness is a much bigger problem than Covid in that regard.  The maximum number of beds taken up by Covid patients in each state this winter was only around ~20%.

Covid has introduced increased burden to hospitals overall since it came about, but right now there's little evidence supporting that that strain is substantial enough that there is a health emergency warranting forced vaccination."

The Suez Crisis, or the Second Arab–Israeli war, also called the Tripartite Aggression (Arabic: العدوان الثلاثي‎, romanized: Al-ʿUdwān aṯ-Ṯulāṯiyy) in the Arab world and the Sinai War in Israel, was an invasion of Egypt in late 1956 by Israel, followed by the United Kingdom and France. The aims were to regain control of the Suez Canal for the Western powers and to remove Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had just nationalised the canal. After the fighting had started, political pressure from the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Nations led to a withdrawal by the three invaders.

When Biden came back from camp David he looked sick. His nose was jacked up and his skin didn't look healthy and he wasn't reacting very well.  During his ABC interview a couple days later, he was tanning. I believe he's hiding a significant medical condition. I mean more than his dementia and decrepit age.

My prediction is he resigns by the end of the year. All he's doing right now is holding on long enough for the situation in Afghanistan to settle down enough for people to kind of forget about it. For it to get out of the new cycle.

That means the border crisis will have been forgotten, the Afghanistan crisis will have been forgotten, and the inflation crisis will for the most part be forgotten when Kamala takes over. Biden will have taken the hit for all of that and The Democrats can say they addressed all those horrible Trump issues when they start campaigning for the 2022 season.

The Democrats will then hope and pray that no major issue comes up between 2022 and 2024 for Kamala to completely destroy. She'll become a figurehead president and mostly stay out of the news because she is horrible when she speaks. She'll do mostly the ceremonial stuff and stay in the White House.  I think there's a good chance though, that will be fighting Iran in Afghanistan and the next year or so.

Makino grew up with Ace, and she's known him for a long time. If we look back, Ace traveled around the world hunting down Blackbeard, it's possible he made a pitstop in Fuschia Village. 

This would put Ace at age 20 and Makino at Age 29 when she would have conceived. She was seen crying and closing the bar after the war. It's obvious she's upset about Ace, but if she was pregnant with his child, she would be trying to protect the identity of the father at all costs. 

Oda has paired older women crushing on younger men, think Hancock and Luffy(Although this is a Shounen).

Most importantly, this would guarantee that his bloodline continues to live, leaving an important link to Ace for Luffy to one day pass the torch. Oda may have killed Ace, but he is survived in will by Luffy, and in Blood by his child.

Try not to downvote until you see the relevance. I understand this can get controversial, but the timeline works out. And again, this IS Oda. Plot twists fly.

Trump's account being banned actually seems problematic to me, if Trump was banned it should have been the law that made that directive, not a twitter reviewer, or a couple of twitter management, this behavior is even more opaque than China - at least we recognize regulation and have some standards and treat all accounts equally.

blm is an issue, and I think people of color are discriminated against outside the US to some extent (we'll be looking at what happens to Asians), but at the same time that shouldn't require the police to look at people of color differently, but to treat everyone the same - it's not easy to do, but it should be necessary, or at least that should be the goal.

Speaking of centralization, I think it's a side effect of the economic downturn. Most countries in the world are gaining more support for the far right and the centralized left, and when people feel bad about the economy, they usually become more extreme.

I have never been to Hong Kong, but I think Hong Kong has reached the limit of one country, two systems. The protesters have openly demanded independence and have struck foreign flags, and I don't think that should be tolerated.

1,"""Something"" is already happening and has been for a long time. We have more people locked up in the United States than anywhere else in the world. Inequality has only increased over the last 4 decades. Gun owners have sat on their asses for all that time, just like they did last summer in the face of vicious police violence. Guns make individuals feel safer but don't do anything to create a more just society (or make them actually safer.)

The comparisons are not good. Knives have other functions than killing things. Public transport is a social good rather than a social ill. The better comparison is to something like environmental pollutants, carcinogenic foods, etc. It's why there are increasing calls to treat gun violence for what it is - a public health issue.

I'm collapsing our two conversations into one to not spam the thread. You write elsewhere:

Your 13 guns are also gonna do jack shit against the police and the military. We need a disarmed police force - which is possible and present even in other capitalist countries that have lower rates of inequality. A step on the way to a disarmed police force (or no police) is drastically reducing the number of guns that exist in the country.

I'm also skeptical that any revolution in the United States could be successful without the aid of the military. The Russian Revolution relied on a disaffected military."

1,"Having a degree in economics, I've heard basically every criticism of the classical labor theory of value and, in general, it's really hard to get it to apply in practical terms - which is why most active economists, even in communist nations, operate within contemporary mathematical economics. Even Soviet economists largely used contemporary economics - in particular Leonid Kantorovich's Linear Programming (which if you're a math nerd is super cool and is still used today throughout the world). I should note that Leonid Kantorovich espoused the labor theory of value in philosophical terms, but virtually ignored it in his writings.

Without boring you with equations. The surplus value problem comes up even without using the labor theory of value because: as Marx pointed out, wages are not bounded by productivity. Just because your labor produces a good worth x amount on the market, does not in anyway entitle you to any sort of compensation relating to that product. This is because there are other people in the labor market affecting your value (among other factors). This excess value goes to the owner of the means of production and not the worker. Your wages are only reflective of the barest minimum value to keep you coming back to work and is in no way related to what you actually produce.

There is also such a monstrously huge difference in power between employer and employee wages are the easiest thing to suppress in the face of productivity increases thus allowing for an increased rate of profit (additional surplus value). To make no mention of other methods of wage suppression (usually lined up with discrimination - paying women or minorities less for the same work). That's why most workplaces so strongly discourage the discussion of wages and benefits between employees, and why HR paperwork related to such things are under strict lock and key.

Edit: Additionally I should say: Marx points out in Kapital volume 1, that if profit were solely generated by buying low and selling high or manipulating prices, with everyone manipulating prices, profit would disappear because somebody down the road would swindle you. Modern economics bears out this same problem, but chalks it up to ""inputs"" which is just a fancy way of saying not paying your workers enough generally speaking."

Secondly while Sanji is given more focus then most Strawhats he's still not the focus in the same way Luffy and Zoro are. It was Luffy and Zoro fighting in Whiskey Peak, Zoro was the one to advise Luffy on what to do about Usopp, It was Zoro who took Luffy's pain (which while Sanji did try to do was not unique as any strawhat would have plus the scene was ultimately given to Zoro), it was Luffy and Zoro who became supernovas, and it was Luffy and Zoro hanging out in Wano. Sanji doesn't really have this much going for him in the grand scheme Luffy is our protagonist and Zoro is his Lancer while Sanji just seems to hang out in the 3rd place slot because ""eh somebody needs to be there""."

0,"That’s only in season 4 of the anime and corresponding manga chapters. I think the characters and plot of the first 3 seasons are great. The story goes from a simplistic “humankind just trying to survive” plot into a mystery of what’s going on in the rest of the world and what happened in the past. Where Reiner, Annie, and Bertholdt come from, who is Ymir, what’s inside the walls, where did grisha come from, and so many other plot lines are really good mysteries. And even in season 4 the paths arc was probably the most I enjoyed the entire series. It could have used a bit more foreshadowing but I thought it was amazing. I don’t 100% disagree with your point on the characters, but there still were characters that stayed relevant and important. Levi, zeke, Annie, mikasa, and armin just to name a few. I also never put too much stake in the philosophical message. I think it works but I also think it’s not all that crazy. It pretty much just boils down to 2 ideas that are both flawed. I think it also serves more for Eren’s character than anything else."

To be not partisan, until recently most Republicans were also power obsessed shitheads. Many still are. Everyone who voted to debate the ""infrastructure bill"" don't belong in this party, but we have some real conservatives now.         

Also, there are Democrats I respect. I loved Tulsi Gabbard despite disagreeing on gun control (but not much else). Despite him being an old red communist, I respect Bernie Sanders.

The fact is that if you want working class reform and equality in labor and economic justice, you need to dismantle the idea that there are second class people and social hierarchies.  If you don't strive for racial gender and sexual orientation equality then you subscribe to a mindset that allows for the ruling class to divide an conquer.

1,"\> never-ending passive income for a one time buy out.

1,"Very literally through lobbying and reification. Roosevelt (FDR) didn't want to alienate the private insurance lobby, so he avoided as much as possible legislating about that topic despite the rising anger of socialist groups. Later on, he and his lobbyists realized that healthcare could be used as a ""fetishized commodity"", using it to barter with employees as a perk -- not a duty -- and thus avoid raising wages. After the war ended and with McCarthyism trending, the tradition of shutting down everything social as ""totalitarian communism"" started within the infantile minds of the american conservatives. 

Why people still accept it in 2021, though, is a more nuanced topic. Beyond this learned indoctrination that the market is best and the government is bad at running things -- they certainly run them as bad as possible in order to reinforce this point -- there is also a certain childish envy: the very well known tantrum which is expressed as ""why should I pay something for someone else?""

That way, the issue behind healthcare is partly the same issue behind anti-socialism. That is, a combination of ignorance, learned propaganda, and simple egoism -- all cultural traits heavily nurtured by capitalists."

1,"I tend to agree, in general, that Biden isn’t calling the shots. I suspect that Obama with his “shadow cabinet” is running things. On this Afghan pull out, however…I think we are seeing Slow Joe Biden…unvarnished; up-close and personal in his natural state. 

Joe’s never been much of a scholar. He’s a slick huckster…has been his entire life. He has no values, no principles, no objective truth. There are no boundaries, no limits. Everything’s relative…negotiable…fungible.

Not unlike Fredo in the scene from *Godfather II*, Joe wanted us to know he can handle things. He’s smart. Not like everybody says... like dumb...he’s smart and he wanted respect. 

In other words, Biden wanted to live up to his name **The Big Guy.** 

He’s always been this way….but in 2021, he’s suffering from dementia AND he’s the President of the United States. He exercised the tremendous powers the Democrat party stole for him on November 3, 2020 when he ordered the immediate and disorderly withdrawal from Afghanistan. 

The repercussions of this disaster will live long after the horrific human tragedy that is now unfolding. The fact that our most advanced weapons will be sold to terrorists around the world weakens our defenses. It will endanger our military and the American people in their homes. It will cost trillions of dollars to reprogram and retrofit those weapons. 

After this fuck up, an **INFORMED** American electorate wouldn’t put another Democrat in the presidency for 50 years.

(*Recall that after the Civil War, the US electorate punished the Democrats for their rebellion and betrayal of America by electing only two Democrats to the presidency in the 64 years between 1869 and 1933.*)"

I 100% agree that we are too divided and should unite more.

I think wherever we stand in the left we should try to be more tolerant towards different socialist ideologies, especially since we always claim to be the most tolerant.
Each of us should try to understand our fellow socialists and we should not judge each other.

1,"In terms of economy, a good complement to the books others have listed is Pierson’s Just Property series, as it compares the historical evolution of socialism and capitalism. It’s rather superficial for people looking for a deep economic analysis, but it’s an excellent overview in my opinion.

But I would say that eventually, one needs to read Marx to truly understand marxism. Depending on the edition you read, there are a number of “commented” works that make it more accessible to people without a background in economics. Reading Pierson is somewhat useful in that regard, as he also explores the relation between ricardian socialists, french radicals, and Marx.

1,"Contemporary world example, from my own country:

Brazil has abundant swaths land, enough for our people to gorge themselves in food.

Yet, each year, around 5,000 brazilians die each year from hunger. Around 21 million are severely malnourished and 100 million don't know if they will have dinner tomorrow. 

So, there must be some structural socioeconomic problem in our society that produces this horrid result.

How is our land distributed? 

It is severely concentraded in the hands of a few landlords. 

They:

1. Don't use the land so they can speculate the price of it. (Create an artificial scarcity)

2. Refuse to produce or dump food so they can get higher prices in the market, even if this means some people will starve because they can't but food at this new higher price.

3. Only produce large amounts of crops, which can be exported to other countries, instead of providing food for our starving population."

1,"There's also the uh... old suspicion that Ulrike Meinhof, a West German Marxist-Leninist, was murdered by the West German government in 1976. I'll give the best tl;dr I can, but I do ask anyone interested in this to check out [her Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulrike_Meinhof).

Meinhof was a journalist who started the Red Army Faction ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Faction)), a West German Marxist-Leninist terrorist group (or insurgent, depending on who you ask, [relevant video for anyone curious about discourse around terrorism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ED6opUDeg8)). While I dislike her tactics and views generally, I still recognise that she was considered a threat by the German ruling class. The Red Army Faction carried out assassinations, bombings, bank robberies and arson against targets associated with capitalism and imperialism in Germany.

Anyway, Meinhof and other ringleaders of the group got arrested and sent to jail. And a number of them killed themselves. Meinhof's suicide is considered suspicious (ie the government staged it as a cover for murdering her) for the following reasons:

* Her body lacked common signs of injuries associated with hanging
* Both autopsy reports mention severe swelling at external genitals as well as abrasions on the left buttock (I don't really understand medicine that well, but to me this implies that she was raped violently before her death)
* Her fingerprints were not found on the lightbulb where the rope hung from.
* No suicide note, despite Meinhof being a prolific writer.
* No fabric was found on her knife or towel.
* 2 days after her death, her cell was cleaned and painted before all evidence had been gather.
* All her personal items were seized and police refused to give them to her relatives or lawyers.
* Other prisoners reported that her handwritten documents, which she kept with her inside a black dossier had also disappeared.
* The authorities prohibited her lawyers from viewing the body and inside of her cell.

While I've known about Meinhof for about a year. I also just learnt about the case of [Siegfried Hausner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegfried_Hausner). He suffered a fractured skull and severe burns after accidentally detonating explosives whilst the RAF took over the West German Embassy in Sweden. Swedish doctors apparently recommend he stay in the hospital in Stockholm, but against their advice the government deported him to Germany to a facility which lacked the ability to treat him and he died a few days later.

Shit, apparently there's also suspicious details in the suicide of Andreas Baader, the most well known member of the RAF: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas\_Baader#Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Baader#Death)

Scary stuff. Post-war Germany isn't uh... as nice as liberals often make it out to be.

My only real unique take is that the experience of the RAF is an excellent case against terrorism/small scale insurgencies as a method to achieve socialism. And we need lawyers."

So, the impression I got, was that it should go something like: pro-war people say x, anti-war people say y, you can decide which of those sounds more reasonable. The problem there being that the arguments for war are harmful and deceptively made to sound appealing, so presenting them as if equally as valid as anti-war arguments is pretty dangerous"

1,"To put it in perspective, a doctor in India, like several of my aunts, earn about 70,000 rs per month (this varies, can be less and can be more), but that’s an reasonable average. That works out to about $1k per month, so around $33 per day. That’s about 50% more than what you’re looking for with your question, but decently close.

That’s very comfortably an upper middle class income. Enough to have a decent place to live, a car, a driver and workers in your house (to cook and clean, as human labor is fairly cheap. The drives get around 6000rs per month), and put your kids in a nice English primary language private school. (This is common in India, when running projects in slums in my hometown, I’ve seen that even kids who’s parents work at food carts will go to cheap private schools [hindi primary language, not English though], as the government run ones can be just that bad). 

In short, $20 a day buys you a very nice quality of life in India, in towns and smaller cities at least. I can’t speak to larger and more expensive places like Delhi, as my family primarily resided in villages till my grandparents generation. For reference, the kids I worked with in the slums of my hometown generally came from families that earned about $2/day or less."

Unless there's specific evidence for that claim, we should assume that Delta is the same as every other variants/viruses (vaccinating does reduce transmission)."

1,">activists and regular people on the ground agitating for equal rights and a more humane society

I agree with this. I also think that articles with this sort of critique come off as quite tone deaf and as the radical liberal sections of the left have much more complex debates related to the struggle than this. Furthermore, it's not that these sections of the left are turned off by Socialism, but it's that Socialist organizations have very basic problems of even safeguarding ""their"" most oppressed members, let alone developing their revolutionary leadership whether they are non-men individuals or oppressed nationality individuals or even disabled. And many radical liberal organizers are aware of this. There have been many organizations throughout the years that have either imploded or collapsed because of this, or they generate individuals dissatisfied with the treatment of oppressed people. If theory reflects practice, then it should be an indication that there needs to be a better theory which can correct such practices. That's the real center of critique that should be had and brings forward a much more interesting discussion, along with many other topics. 

This article might be correct on what it terms as ""woke capitalism"" but it's a very cheap gotcha."

1,"Mate, with all due respect, that's not where it came from or where it started.

The disrespect started when he won the double in 98. And while nobody wants to say it, it came from the man having the audacity to be an extroadinary talent whist being unapologetically un-British. 

Foreign players were still considered exotic back then and it was a given that foreign managers would struggle and he didn't. Not to mention that football in Britain was deeply entrenched in ""macho"" culture and Wenger had to nerve to shun that too.

If you think I'm  wrong, here's a stat: Arsenal were the first British club to side an all foreign team and manager. I know this because the media lost its shit when it happened. He was the face that ushered in the new age of foreign prominence and dominance in British football and he became a reviled figure for it. 

He said he could go an entire season unbeaten, then did it the following year. It should probably be noted that not only was his team largely foreign but it was also largely black, which generally wasn't a thing in those days either. Which is to say that it probably contributed to the culture resent he experienced back then.

Nobody cares about any of this stuff now, but they did back then and the disrespect was made fully acceptable. The jeering attitude in Arsenal's decline years after the stadium move was mostly casual and condescending by that point and lacked the venom of his early days in Britain."

See: Space industrialization.

You can call me all the names you want but at the end of the night the only thing that will be on your mind that you took a poison that we now know does absolutely nothing since you can still get covid or what they keep calling covid since we don't even have a test that tells you subjectively if you've got this particular strain. You never bothered to ask a questions as to why did the flu all of a sudden disappear or what other options are available, you just took something that somebody told you was going to do something and now we're finding out does absolutely nothing. You're stuck in the middle and I get that but be careful when you go around calling people idiots and morons just because they don't agree with you because that door swings both ways. The government lied to you, Fauxxi lie to you, the CDC lied to you and the WHO lied to you. You can have whatever opinion you want of me but believe me, I'm not the moron."

1,"As absurd as this article is, when you ignore the nonsense it points to a real issue. That is the domination of society by banks.

The chain of debt doesn't end at landlords. Tenants owe landlords rent, but the landlords owe banks mortgage payments plus interest.

So if tenants don't pay the landlords enough rent to meet their mortgage payments (which may or may not be interest only), the landlords can get into arrears which then poses a problems for the banks' balance sheets, which if systemic enough represents a financial crisis (which will impact upon businesses which require credit to operate, and hence workers).

I believe housing is a human right and landlordism should be abolished, but we have short term problems to solve also.

A moratorium on bank loan repayments seems reasonable, the question is then what the banks are supposed to do after having so many of their assets frozen. Not sure, but presumably the state could just loan them that much at low interest and that would close the cycle.

Taxes and utilities I'm not so sure. I mean you could freeze utility payments but then you might as well just nationalise all the utilities, which I'd be in favour of (but which won't happen). Taxes no. If you're renting out your own house or are a small time landlord I think that's a different case, but definitely any kind of professional landlord like this is in a different category and I don't see an argument for tax relief."

However, if I recall correctly, in the US legal system you have to prove intent behind a firing decision. It is very easy for an employer to find some BS excuse for a firing and plead in court that the reason listed was the reason for firing and it is very difficult for the employee to show that they were discriminated against. As always, the more wealthy and powerful side of the transaction has more ability to defend their actions before the law, while the oppressed and powerless are less able to assert their rights."

But I don't know what was USSR supposed to do then, peacefully co-exist with capitalist world and don't try to separate itself from it? I highly doubt it would've worked, it wasn't that type of country and it wasn't that kind of situation where it was possible. 

Russian Empire was already very outdated when it collapsed, both in technology, society and culture. Devastation of both world wars and civil war had its effect too. Cold War wasn't on equal footing to begin with, and so USSR got obsessed with 'catching up to and overcoming' capitalist world, and obsession like this tends to have a poor effect in the long run, as well as radicalize population. Although from my perspective post-WW2 population of USSR was nowhere near as radicalized and casually spiteful as modern Russian population, which is an interesting thing.

As for many people defending Stalin, well, from their point of view if you don't defend Stalin that came to power not that long after revolution, then you are probably against everything that was after him as Khruschev wouldn't have existed without him. Then you are against pretty much everything USSR was, therefore conservative 'socialists' will be upset with you. They don't care about ideology and theory too much."

But he got bowled for a duck (0) and retired with 6996 runs to his names, 70 dismissals and 52 tests played. His career was interrupted by the Second World War, which he signed up to serve in.

The second highest test batting average ever is around 62. Bradman also held a slew of other records such as centuries in single sessions of play, most runs in a day, scored 499 once I think. He played cricket for over 20 years despite the Second World War interrupting him and was by far the world's best player around the age of 39, which has never been emulated since."
1,"If they had held him in contempt formally (they didn’t – this was just something that was said in a debate, not an actual motion) then it becomes a bit awkward for us (the British) constitutionally. 

Technically, contempt is an offence that parliament has the judicial power to punish itself; and constitutionally that process is outside of the rest of the legal system. Which means things like diplomatic, sovereign and state immunity don’t apply. So (very theoretically, if he were found to be in contempt by the Commons) he could be arrested and imprisoned for up to two years (or at the next general election, if earlier). (The Lords can imprison for life, but in this example it would be the Commons.)

It’s constitutionally awkward both because that process would be very contrary to international law, and would complicate the Queen’s political neutrality – convention is she invites every (diplomatically recognised) foreign head of state for a state visit exactly once."

He went two yrs without scoring? You mean the two years were he was injured on and off? Those two years?

Lastly comparing Mbappe and Salah to a player like Hazard based purely on is ignorant, because Hazard was a completely different type of player who’s impact on the game couldn’t be measured by stats.(And is the only thing they have over Hazard because by the eye test it was clear who was better)"

1,"My father was a political refugee, an illegal immigrant who ultimately did the paperwork and became a legal permanent resident.  He ran from Guatemala while civil war was still ravaging it; I'm not clear on details, but he also seemed to have been targeted for things he did back in that country.  He would sometimes talk about how that all had come to be (you may already know the story... the US working to depose a duly elected leader who wanted to return croplands to the people) as well as good things to say about the big name of latino revolutionaries, Che Guevarra.  But when I was a child I didn't understand the economics of the matter.  When presented with ideas of communism, I would think of Che Guevarra, his heroism and how people fondly remembered him.  I had developed a receptiveness to the idea of communism as not being wholly evil, but it was not particularly different in intellectual virtue from being raised to see it as a completely evil system the way most have been.  I may have amounted to a social democrat at best up until last year.  I find human suffering an eyesore.  I don't want to hear about it anymore.  I want a world like those hopeful era sci-fi stories showing humanity united and traveling the stars with all their basic needs already met.  I consider grand problems that stand in the way to realizing that future, and I feel motivated to find solutions to those broad problems.  I am also what could be called a ""compassionate misanthrope"": I want the best for humanity, but continuously observing how difficult humanity makes things for itself and its failures to check or overcome its own dysfunctional natures infuriates me to the point of hatred.  You can imagine a sense of self-hate or unavoidable existential shame plagues me personally with a mindset like this.  I try to avoid it by denying my own humanity.  

It was once I started finding Dr. Richard Wolff in my Youtube recommendations within the past 2-3 years that I began my most significant steps of conversion to socialism, because he clarified the precise distinctions that I never actually took the time to read about: the abolishment of the relationship, what ""seizing the means"" actually meant for society, and how the landscape of socialism allowed for multitudes of perspectives to build a society and that even communism has different brands outside of the authoritative and one-party variants.  I felt like I could belong in that camp and that the systemic problems (including tendencies of humanity itself) holding humanity back and threatening it that I had considered before could be adequately addressed by first achieving socialism.  It was the first time I was explicitly thinking with both eyes open to what socialism and communism really were.  Now I'm on board with libertarian socialism and economic overthrow of the corporate model with cooperative models competing with them.  I want to establish a cooperative myself and get to work dismantling capitalism in its capital nation.  Perhaps the rest of the capitalistic world will fall if it does so here first, and, poetically, I could finally exact vengeance for my father's motherland and its people.

The incidents emanating from the pandemic conditions as well as other ongoing patterns (right now my sights are on the video game industry with Ubisoft, Blizzard, Riot Games, etc.) showed me most explicitly that capitalistic rot and the bourgeois class's immense greed and lack of compassion can be assigned a great majority of the blame for many things going wrong, and that socialism can be the solution.  Dr. Richard Wolff, Second Thought, David Pakman (he's emphatically a social democrat rather than a socialist, but still informative), The Rational National, The Majority Report, Ring of Fire, and Jacobin have helped me see things the Marxist way bit by bit until it has come to the point where I learn nothing new about my society and its dismal dystopian state from the senational news pieces they continue to show.  At least the Jacobin and Dr. Wolff go in-depth on the more conceptual and practical elements and provide some useful insights, but the others have basically outlived their use for me with their principle-based news coverage.  They are, however, educating others about the deep and recurring issues affecting our society and why they matter, so I hope their work continues indefinitely.  I just lost patience with the spectacles and verbal shamings of people we cannot even touch right now; I only come up with *lethally* counterproductive ideas when I see rich people or politicians being the problem in news, and the movement would probably not benefit from them."

0,"lol jesus. you didn't move the goalposts, you fuckin switched the whole damn sport up on me. i don't even really know where to start to unpack this comment, but here goes.  

>The effects a bodily autonomy decision has over others is irrelevant and not included in any definition of the word  

I don't know if english is your second language or you just mistyped or what, but i really don't understand what you're trying to say here. what isn't included in *what* definition of *what* word? 

skipping over that, the entire point of my comment was that you're simplifying the vaccine as ""choosing what to do with their body"", but it's not that simple. Give me an example of somebody making a ""bodily autonomy decision"" that widely effects the people around them like covid does? do you not understand the concept of trying to stop the spread of a virus?  

>Weird that you’re using the exact same logic as the pro life crowd. Using the effect it has on others as a reason to not allow bodily autonomy is not a road you even want to go down  

lol what? first of all, *nobody* said anything about abortion or pro choice before you did, i don't even understand where that's coming from or how your brain got that wrapped up in here, but explain to me how the logic of that is the same?  

Somebody gets an abortion, they may cause spiritual pain or emotional distress or whatever you want to even call it to somebody who is/whatever. That's a bummer, life goes on for both parties.  

Somebody comes to work unvaccinated, 3 people get covid and die.  

do you see the difference here?"

0,"Defense for forwards in hockey isn’t really comparable to basketball in that it’s not nearly as important. A great offensive player like Gretzky had possession of the puck so often that his way of playing defence was to just have the puck in the offensive zone most of the time.  

Lemieux possibly could have matched Gretzky’s peak if he didn’t get injured and have cancer, but it’s quite unlikely that he matches Gretzky’s career.  

Before Lemieux came back from retirement, he was the NHL’s all time leader in points per game, even ahead of Gretzky.  

It should be noted that Lemieux, after coming out of retirement (a retirement forced upon him by cancer and back injuries), came back at age 35, to a brand new “era” of hockey and immediately became the best player in the league.   

As for current players, Ovechkin has a shot to break Gretzky’s all time goals record. I don’t think it would change too much in people’s eyes, as Ovechkin is already widely viewed as the best goal scorer of all time. Gretzky was always more of a playmaker, he just was so good that he also scored a ton of goals, to the point where he still has the most goals scored of all time."

I am anti rich people, and by rich I mean your wealth compared to the people around you. none of that, everyone is rich compared to people in poor countries. but that feeling of anti rich people is separate from socialism, I just think its a moral failing. If you become rich then imo you have a moral obligation to use it to help others.

If you come into a lot of wealth its perfectly acceptable to use it to live a life free from wage slavery, to live comfortably. but a $3 million dollar home is beyond what is reasonable imo. And I'd lose respect for anyone who instead of using their new found wealth to help others, they use it to buy frivolous shit... like a 3 million dollar house."

Another important reason that is often pushed aside is that, it is actually in the interests of certain portions of the US population to preserve imperialism.

1,"[Trotsky's position on trade unions is remarkably clear.](

>The Bolshevik-Leninist stands in the front-line trenches of all kinds of struggles, even when they involve only the most modest material interests or democratic rights of the working class. He takes active part in mass trade unions for the purpose of strengthening them and raising their spirit of militancy. He fights uncompromisingly against any attempt to subordinate the unions to the bourgeois state and bind the proletariat to “compulsory arbitration” and every other form of police guardianship—not only fascist but also “democratic.” Only on the basis of such work within the trade unions is successful struggle possible against the reformists, including those of the Stalinist bureaucracy. Sectarian attempts to build or preserve small “revolutionary” unions, as a second edition of the party, signify in actuality the renouncing of the struggle for leadership of the working class. It is necessary to establish this firm rule: self-isolation of the capitulationist variety from mass trade unions, which is tantamount to a betrayal of the revolution, is incompatible with membership in the Fourth International.

Certainly, the trade unions are often bureaucratic, reactionary, reformist, and all manner of other words. But that's absolutely no reason not to work in them, or to set up as WSWS suggests, 'rank-and-file committees' at the workplace. Simply put, the trade unions are where you find the masses, particularly the most politically advanced layers. 

So in this instance, the WSWS breaks with the Trotskyist position on trade unions (which is quite a significant break indeed, as Trotsky wrote that such a move makes you *incompatible with membership of the fourth international*).

I'll also quote [this article](

>The problem is not with the working class, which hasn't moved en masse at this stage, but with the sectarian's lack of confidence in the working class. They talk about the inability of the working class to change the Labour Party, due to the lack of democracy in the party. The sects used this argument in the past about not being able to change the TGWU, the GMB or the EEPTU. But they were proved wrong! When the working class moves no amount of bureaucratic rules will prevent it from changing its organizations. That has been the lesson of history, and it is for Marxists to learn the lessons of history and not repeat its mistakes.

>...Before the working class will move to change society, they will first of all attempt to transform their traditional organizations from top to bottom. This is quite logical as workers draw different conclusions at different times and tend to take the line of least resistance."

What's one of the worst things you can be seen doing as a politician? Nothing. Even if doing something will be worse than if you did nothing, the masses will demand that you ""Just do somethinggg!!1!"". Most all of them also need to be re-elected, have a strong desire to stay in the spotlight for various reasons.

So, by enacting these incredibly harmful mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns, it's a great way to, well, cover their own ass. They can virture signal as much as they want, and claim how they just care soooo much about people. If (when) all those things fail to make a difference, they can always shift the blame to the people for not doing well enough. Just look at how the media and social media cover politicians who have kept open vs. ones who shut everything down. Not to mention the obvious power that comes from something like this. ""Never let a good crisis go to waste.""

Then, you have all the politicians in the world who don't need a reason to oppress and fuck over their own people, but certainly love a good excuse to. Especially when you have so many people begging for it.

In addition, the media and all the ""experts"" obviously want this to continue as long as possible. The media is more popular now than ever, between big scary virus and orangemanbad. There's good money and views to be had from keeping people terrified and paranoid. And all the ""experts"" certainly don't want to fade back into irrelevance, sort of like the media.

This ""pandemic"" was over long ago in many countries, US included. It's an absolute joke how people continue to be terrified and paranoid of this virus with a stupidly high survival rate. Essentially everyone has had an opportunity to receive the vaccine if they want it. The role of government in all of this is all but over, and we should all be completely getting back to our lives at this point."

1,"Depends what you mean by socialism. There are so many different things which have called or call themselves 'socialist' that it becomes meaningless to ask 'what are the problems of *socialism*?'.

For example, the problems of Blanquism, Kropotkinist anarcho-communism, Maoism, and Social Revolutionary terrorism are completely different. The problems of 1930s Anarcho-syndicalist Spain, 2020s socialism 'with Chinese characterics', 1970s Cuban Marxist-Leninism, and 1950s Swedish social democracy are very different. Even the problems of 1920s USSR and 1980s USSR are very different.

If I had to pick one generic thing, I'd say the biggest problem of socialists and socialism as applied in practice throughout history has been lack of participatory democracy. A relatively small group of people deciding that they will control things. This was not new in the USSR in the 20s (for example, in the 19th century you had the Blanquists who were conspiratorial elitist authoritarian revolutionaries, Charles Fourier whose utopian socialism involved an enlightened elite designing and establishing ideal communities for the masses, or many Social Democrats who wanted to lead the masses rather than let the masses lead themselves).

This problem was intensified after the 1917 revolution because Bolshevism gained a worldwide prestige which eventually lead to 'socialism' becoming synonymous with 'Bolshevism' for most socialists. And *particularly* after Stalin replaced Lenin. So 'socialism' came to mean a society where democracy is taken perhaps even less seriously than in a liberal capitalist republic. Lack of democracy is not a problem unique to Leninism though.

It’s the same case with Lampard and Ole. Had the ban period been longer for Chelsea, Lampard might have done better. The ambition of Abramovich with the players he brought in meant that Lampard had to compete short term, and he didn’t have the capacity to do so. Ole however had a dream start albeit a terrible drop straight after, but he got lucky with Bruno saving the team, and managed to buy him time to stabilise the squad and his seat."

1,"The way I see it is that inflation helps the ruling elites hide wage cuts and stagnation. For example; in 1950 in America the minimum wage was 75 cents an hour. You might think that the current minimum wage of $7.25 is a decent increase of over 950%. However if you account for inflation that 75 cent is equivalent to $8.28 today. Which means in reality minimum wage earners have taken a pay cut of over 10% in the last 70 years.

MMT is not so worried about inflation as long as it isn't hyperinflation. It is an idea to increase the spending power of the government without raising taxes (mainly on the rich and corporations) by means of money printing. 

MMT is nothing more than a regressive tax system in my eyes. This is because it keeps corporate tax low and decreases the wages of working people by reducing the buying power of their wages. And in the end there is no practical difference between paying more of your wage into taxes, or inflation causing your wage to be worth less. Either way workers get less for their labor."

There are a few things you have to accept though: we won’t get a star through free agency, Lebron and AD type players are never going to force themselves here unless they have some tie already, and we likely aren’t going to competing for a championship unless everything goes right. When you accept that, you just have to set proper expectations."

The passing is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the backscreens will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Kerr’s kumbaya outlook, which is deftly woven into his playbook - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Marxist literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these plays, to realize that they’re not just basketball - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike GSW truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the complexity in Kerr’s existencial catchphrase ""Strength in Numbers"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Harry C. Triandis’s “Individualism and Collectivism.” I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Joe Lacob’s genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Warriors tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only.

1,"He gets paid under contract as a proportion of the ad revenue, which goes up by his viewership. Two things happened, First, Trump and the election caused a massive jump to his viewership, streaming his normal hours but to a 100k audience at the height of the Pres election. Second, covid. Pretty much every major streamer made bank because everyone was at home starved of entertainment, everyone's viewership doubled. Also, the streamers weren't going out anywhere, weren't taking holidays.

  
Basically, he has a normal, non-exploitative, scale-able contract, and history just gave him two years of a massive viewership boost.

  
Edit: Can I just add - putting details of a streamers home, layout, location etc online like this is pretty shitty. Normal every day gaming streamers don't even put a camera anywhere near a window so that the worst of fans and haters can't try work out where they live, to display this guys home, when he's a leftie in that environment and one of the biggest profiles is down-right dangerous."

President Biden has a unique chance here to call an end to the failure of Wilsonian foreign policy. He could say that the USA has spent ungodly sums of money and thousands of American troop's lives and it's time to accept that we did not achieve our goals despite 20 years and 3 different presidential administrations making some kind of attempt at it. Now is the time to leave this conflict to the history books. 

The people of Afghanistan are going to have to choose their own path. The United States needs to move away from decades of bad foreign policy and Afghanistan can be the catalyst that does it.

but instead, we take ""climate change is no longer reversible"" as evidence of our own demise and, in so doing, we abdicate responsibility for what comes next. no one can ask us to do hard work we don't understand how to do if it's all beyond our capacity to effect. it's a form of seductive nihilism, the sweet and silent call of the void, the siren drawing us ever nearer by promising us certain demise.

Interesting. I tend to consider more the structure of the business itself. If it's an relationship then it's capitalist, if it's a co-op or other such arrangement so that the workers own or otherwise have control (even if by way of an intermediary bureaucracy) then it's socialist.

A business is simply competing in a market and though it \*does\* matter (e.g. to me) whether the competition operates in a socialist or capitalist way, it really doesn't matter.

From what I know, Putin's power is based on the fact that he has Russia's most powerful oligarchs backing him. That is also a weakness; what if the oligarchs abandon him? Putin has currently a strong grip on Russia (he can basically get almost anybody killed or exiled) but that might not be the case forever. He can very well be ousted one day. Some new guy can rise from the shadows (just like Putin did) and take the lead.

But you can never really know what is going on in Russia. The country has always been very secretive. And Russian people are very skeptical towards their leaders. They might act like they love Putin, but behind closed doors it's totally different story. They aren't dumb or mindless. It's not like with Trump and his supporters who actually believe almost anything their leader says. And especially young Russians are very anti-Putin."

Now they are, yes.  20 years ago, Venezuela was the richest country in Latin America.  Then they decided to try socialism.  The socialists thought it would be a great idea to nationalize industry and bribe the people with the wealth from it.  ...and the industry failed as a result.  The socialists also (wisely for their continuing in power) banned private firearm ownership, and did buybacks and confiscations.  Then they changed the government into what is effectively a dictatorship.  Now the people are starving and they ran out of zoo animals to eat years ago, and only the government has guns.

The big positive take away is that it's another signal that the American Empire is crumbling so we can cheer that and laugh at them for their failure. 

But otherwise we simply do what we always do, express concern and show solidarity for the Afghan people, and extend our support, where possible, to any  homegrown communist and anarchist revolutionaries on the ground in Afghanistan, hoping that they'll be able to free their country from reaction once and for all.

The scientific approach also looks for reproducible results so the more studies you have saying similar things but done slightly differently the more you confirm the situation from an empirical point of view. The value of that can be debated but it's the kind of thing you need to make some level of headway on the situation. 

&x200B;

Getting this stuff out in the broader media is also important because not everyone is engaged enough to catch things the first time around. Some people might forget and need to be reminded. 

&x200B;

Also, situations change over time. So updating the data and showing how bad things still are or how they have gotten worse not better is important too.

I do agree that having the studies and doing little or nothing to fix the situation makes the data fairly useless. We've known how bad things are in a general sense for decades and our country overall continues to support the genocide, which is horrifying."

1,People will rag on him for being a product of nepotism which is an actual fair criticism of him but when people bring this up and how it helped him get to where he is he uses it as an example of why capitalism is a terrible system. Its stupid that he is able to make that much money and the fact that someone who is a self proclaimed dumbass can make a killing because of all the luck he was birthed into. Instead of claiming it was all him he admits to this and points to it in fundamental flaws in the system and why it needs to be changed from the ground up. It is very easy to just judge someone based on their income alone but he has been very consistent in his views at least which is a lot more you can say about most other leftist content creators.

0,"Lol it's not screwing over the franchise if they only get 2 picks instead of 5.  The difference with making a S&T happen and signing a 5 year ""with the understanding they would help trade him in a year"" is it takes ALL of the power away from Beal.  So what if Boston makes another ""bad offer"" again.  The Wizards tell Beal they couldn't milk enough out of the Celtics so he has to stay another year?  The S&T makes it an absolute that he goes where he wants to go.  The Wizards had a chance to trade Beal last offseason for a massive haul.  They can trade him again this season for a good haul.  If they wait until next offseason, they will have almost no leverage and be at the mercy of where Beal wants to play.  And if he wants to play for a team over the cap, I guarantee you the Wizards will help facillitate it because getting something back to let him play for the Celtics is better than screwing themselves, Beal and the Celtics over just so he can sign with San Antonio, Detroit etc.

&x200B;

Look at the Jimmy Butler S&T again.  The Sixers literally only got Josh Richardson back.  Lowry only netted Precious and a bad Dragic contract.  If the Wizards wanted an actual return for Beal, they should have traded him last year.  

&x200B;

But why would Boston want to do Smart and 5 firsts this year without a long term guarantee on Beal (he would not do an extension because he could get more with a new contract) when they can do 2 firsts and guarantee Beal for at least 3 years next offseason.  If Beal signs elsewhere next season (anywhere, not just Boston), I guarantee you the Wizards will facillitate a S&T and it will be for much lower than Beal's value.  The point of a S&T isn't to net equal value for Beal, it's so he can play where he wants to play, and the Wizards get a little something back for playing nice.  Like I said, they aren't going to screw themselves, Beal and whoever is signing him just to spite that team."

More rings, fmvps, dpoys and as many MVPs as Malone

As many rings, more finals MVPs, more MVPs and as many dpoys as KG

Accolades obviously aren't everything, of course. But if you take accolades alone that puts literally just Timmy ahead of Giannis.

1,"I broadly agree. I don't think we need to wait until socialism to transition away from the current animal exploitation systems. A lot could be done before then, as in, a lot of the capacity to transition is there already.

Similarly, you don't need a socialist society to have a Just Transition from fossil fuels to other energy sources.

I think it's important to put it in its environmental context because that informs the appropriate time scales. Since animal agriculture is one of the greatest polluters, both of GHGs and of water sources (as well as destroying the soil), we need to phase out the bulk of it in quite a short time. So the more 'narrow' ethical aim of humans not exploiting other animals unnecessarily overlaps with the 'wider' aim of not collapsing the Earth's biosphere.

For example, I live in a country (Ireland) where of emissions are produced by agriculture, which basically means animal agriculture. We can't be waiting generations to comfortably transition, it has to happen soon."

That’s not even factoring in the possibility of overachieving through good management, something Wenger and even Emery did to a degree. 

And it’s not surprising. He has ZERO management experience prior to getting the Arsenal role. Would people be so enamoured by his “potential” if he was a ugly bold fat Yorkshireman who used to be Big Sam’s assistant but achieved the EXACT same results as Arteta and played they EXACT same football? Clearly not. So it’s beyond obvious that any fanfare around Arteta is not based on his ability as a manager and instead utterly useless superficial characteristics"

it's also very hard to undo the legacy of soviet hegemony on a number of levels: many changes to regional ecosystems (industrial production of monocrop cotton, destruction of the aral sea, fallout from nuclear tests etc) are at least semipermanent, while industrialization has driven irrevocable shifts in daily life for central asian populations. it's an unfortunate situation with few ""good"" paths forward; decolonization is unfortunately not a panacea for the permanent legacy of its inverse."

1,"Marx, as a good heir of the young hegelians, was certainly opposed to the essence of religion. But he, along with a lot of other XVIII-XIX century thinkers, failed to understand the way it has become interwoven with social change. 

Just as there are movements built on a relationship between nation, ethnicity, and socialism, religion often forms part of these cultures. For example, the very memeable crucifix Evo Morales gifted to Pope Francis is a direct allusion to “Liberation Theology” socialism, and the ideas of marxist-jesuit revolutionary Luis Camps (that is a real thing). As to why these movements exist, it’s in my opinion because of three reasons: 1) the obvious socialist content in christianism; 2) the widespread adoption of christianism after the european invasions; and 3) the tactical utility of embracing syncretism rather than atheism as a way to galvanize the masses, and simultaneously, to take away power from the reactionary church. 

Whether or not this is “still” marxist is up to debate, but it’s certainly socialist. You probably know that a lot of the direct precursors of Marx, like Saint-Simon or Weitling, were “religious socialists”, and indeed socialism has largely been tied to religion throughout history. Personally, I believe these global south movements to be “marxian”, as they still uphold some of its developments and theory despite adapting them to their material needs — which Marx obviously couldn’t foresee entirely."

They wanted an endless excuse to be there and stay there and the Taliban was a convenient one. They do not care at all that the Taliban is retaking control. The war hawks will use it to say “see? We needed MORE guns, more military funding, more operations” and the libs will only see it as proof that the whole occupation was a wasteful failure, but fail to recognize what I wrote above—this is all according to plan, really. The capitalists made their money and now they’re moving on to their next target for exploitation."

Also a coop wouldn’t really work for construction. Crews are usually less than workers anyway so what would that system add?  Under capitalism, it’s the developers who provide the capital to acquire the materials and you still haven’t answered the question of who replaces developers…is it the government? Are they telling the workers what to build and buying the supplies?"

0,"> and were (relative to his era) equivalent to GSW.

KD and curry were both mvp level players who were each individually capable of being the best guys on 60+ win teams that could make the finals. in their primes. they both have multiple scoring titles. pippen's best scoring year was 22ppg on above-average efficiency. that's it. you can't have pippen as your 1 guy and make the finals. pippen was a great player, but he was not a true 1 option on any team going deep in the playoffs due to his lack of offense. if jordan and barkley had teamed up in their primes, that would be similar. one guy as the main scoring option with a good 2nd option and some good pieces around him is not a team that's anything like as stacked, even ""relative to their era"", to KD gsw

rodman was a great fit with the bulls but what he was great at was rebounding and defense exclusively, he was not providing a 3rd option on offense like kyrie is for the nets or like klay was for the KD warriors. he was not going off for 40. and they didn't have grant and rodman at the same time. you're conflating different eras"
1,"So disagree with the title, not the conditions. As I wrote; questionable, not laughable. It isn't known how this has spread on Martha's Vineyard. Was the party a factor? Possibly yes, possibly no. All it takes is one Uber driver, chauffer, waiter or busboy in lax conditions. 

I don't much care for the title either, as it's just one more instance of finger-pointing in a year of people doing it. However, the connection of the party to the location does exist.

An example: I currently work from home and have been disease-free. If I were to get up from my desk, walk to a convenience store, purchase groceries, return home and, in two weeks, test positive for COVID should I not consider that I got infected at the store, rather than some random surface I may have brushed against? 

You said the party being a contributing factor to the local COVID rate was ""laughable."" I disagree, because it very well could be a factor, however large or small."

1,"It's not like the Taliban came over with some political proposals and won the population over with the strength of their pitch. They made threats, infiltrated military infrastructure and when the time came gave people a choice of surrender or fighting. There was no help coming from the US or any other coalition members and there was no help coming from the central government so why would they not surrender?

You're right that we have to question the administration and occupation of the country though."

1,"Well, the context of the question was to counter someone who uses mainstream economy to ""refute"" Marx, which is why I was arguing from the position of the discpipline, and advising side stepping it by talking about other social sciences. But I suppose I could  be read differently, so to be clear: I'm not advocating orthodox economics.  


Is all mainstream economics bullshit? I don't know if we can say that. It's generally, politically bullshit and serves the ruling class, but there does exist things even in orthodox economics which has real life application, most notably in fields like business economics.  


One thing that does seem to connect Marxist economists seems to be that they all interpret the LTV differently. Hudson's ideas is for sure interesting, but it's very much his own thing."

KG's peak was so high, and I really wish he had won a championship that MVP year. 

People don't recognize just how good his 2003 season was. 

It's a top 30 season of all time. By win shares that peak KG year is better than the best seasons of Tim Duncan, Kobe, Dirk, Steph Curry, Karl Malone, Chris Paul, Jerry West.

By VORP that season is the 10th best season of all time.

That year KG was Michael Jordan in 1996 level of play.

But alas, he was surrounded by awful players his whole career, and my favorite player will probably be forgotten because he only got one ring."

1,"Yes that’s how democratic centralism works. The party decides on the candidate they want to represent them, and put them forward as the party candidate. It doesn’t mean other party members couldn’t run as a union candidate. Just that there was a member that was selected as the party’s candidate. Standards were in place to guarantee that the candidate was a worker, had a good record and played a role in local politics before they were selected. Which is why the candidate was usually chosen. 

Here is a good work on the system. "

While it is evident that Israel is trying to create a self-sufficient ethnostate, I don't think self-sufficiency is achievable by them and palestinians continue to exist as a culture despite their best efforts. Then, removing this foreign support would mean an immediate crisis, in a parallel to how colonial regimes faced disintegration when their ""parent"" country withdrew support for them."
