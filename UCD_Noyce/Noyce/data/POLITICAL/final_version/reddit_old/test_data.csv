0,"Here is an excellent [article](http://www.dogstardaily.com/training/more-bite-inhibition-because-its-so-important) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vrPDMc-I-k) on teaching your dog bite inhibition. I would be cautious with the other replies on this thread (but I *completely* understand where they are coming from), because if you *stop* the biting before she has learned to inhibit her bite, then, considering that she is drawing blood 25% of the time, she could do some serious damage if she ever feels the need to bite out of fear."

From what you've said and the other reply, it sounds like it is the ratio that's not agreed with me. The ones I've liked have been 50/50 and either 12mg, 15mg or 18mg. I thought it was just the higher nicotine content that was producing that effect. As you said, it really is a horrible experience and you are left to deal with it if you haven't got a supply like I did.

I wanted to get to the bottom of it because I feel like I'm stuck to buying what I know is ok and not expanding out to other vendors. If I've found 50/50 to be ok, is that something I can stick to or do I need to consider other variables?"

Meanwhile, we have the ""Deedeereddit"" channel in-game for all the newbros to ask questions, which stays pretty active and chatty talking about all sorts of things, sometimes just shooting the breeze, other times talking through how to spiral in on an enemy so your frigate isn't turned to dust in a couple seconds.

0,"Not OP, but I worked at scout camp for a couple of years. I can verify that yes, the LDS scouts were the worst. I can't really speculate on what the core cause was, but many of the scouts just didn't give *a fuck*. They were their because they had to be there, and so they didn't really put in any effort. Couple this with leaders whose goal is to push the kids through a crapton of merit badges as fast as possible to get them to eagle and you have a poisonous combination.

The leader's control every aspect of the scouts' life at camp. They control what merit badges they go to. They control what activities they attend, they control what formation the scouts march in, the boys don't get a say in any of that, and so naturally they feel stuck and frustrated. And frustrated boys do destructive things.

If the LDS kids *chose* to go to scouts and *chose* to attend scout camp, then I'm sure teaching them would be easier than it was. But instead we get kids who don't want to be there, so they just goof off. I can't tell you how many times I had to go ""pay attention, when you are up at the rock wall you *will* need to know this knot in order to, you know, not die.""

Now I'm not saying *all* LDS troops are like this, but there are far more bad LDS troops than there are bad non-LDS troops. Most of our staff came from non-LDS backgrounds, and the staff is made up of serious scouters, people who want to be there because they truly love the organization. In fact the LDS staffers were frequently (but not always) the most difficult to deal with.

Anyway, still enjoyed my time I spent at scout camp. Some of the best summers of my life."
1,"Yeah. They would. To the borrower, a loan is a liability obviously, but to the lender, be it a bank or any other lending institution, the loan is an *asset.* Wipe out the loan, and you wipe out the asset portfolio of every single lending institution on the planet. That means instant insolvency, and with *every* lending institution insolvent, there would be none left to take over the liabilities of the failed institutions â€¦ meaning the *deposits* those institutions have on their books.

In most economies there's a safety net that guarantees, with government funds, the deposits held by a failed bank, but guess what wiping out all debt in the world would also do? That's right. It'd wipe out all government funds. Every treasury on the planet, be it national or municipal or what, would vanish in a flash, meaning that depository-insurance safety net also vanishes in a flash.

And in fact, since every single monetary unit on the planet â€” dollars, pounds, whatever â€” is backed by debt, wiping out all the debt would erase *all money* from existence. Not just the contents of your bank account and your government's treasury, but also the *very banknotes in your pocket* would be worthless, because they wouldn't be backed by anything. If anybody chose to accept them as payment for a good or service, it'd be pure coincidence, and a dumb move on the part of the seller, frankly.

To say that wiping out all debt would cause every economy on the planet to collapse isn't going far enough. The economies wouldn't simply *collapse.* They'd *cease to exist.* Poof. Gone. We're back to barter, unless and until somebody establishes a new monetary unit and starts taking on new debt."

>Bayernâ€™s current leading goalscorer Mario Gomez (26) has pledged his long-term future to the club. The Germany international, who has 37 goals to his name in 41 matches this season, has inked a new deal keeping him at FCB until 30 June 2016, after agreeing the terms of a contract extension with the FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen AG board of directors.

>â€œAs Iâ€™ve always said, FC Bayern is a magnificent club, where I feel good and where I believe I have the best sporting perspective, so Iâ€™m delighted weâ€™ve agreed a contract extension,â€ commented Gomez, â€œIâ€™m convinced weâ€™re set for great things here in the years to come. I want to play my part in that.â€œ

>â€œIn recent years, Mario Gomez has developed into one of Europeâ€™s best strikers,â€ said Bayern director of sport Christian Nerlinger, â€œweâ€™re delighted heâ€™ll continue to score his goals for FC Bayern. Weâ€™ve now concluded contract extensions with Mario and other current internationals, securing a long-term foundation for FC Bayern over the coming years.â€

I've already replaced some of our yard with low water plants and succulents, but I just don't have the funds to fully landscape our place now.

Lawns require mowing and fertilizing, yes, but not a lot of thought. Succulents take a little finesse and need protection from overwatering/sunburn/frost.

Those GPUs are cut from a big silicon wafer, then tested. If the chip passes all tests, its branded as a top GPU (GTX 680/HD 7970 Ghz). If it fails, some capabilities are turned off and tested again. If it passes this time, its branded the next tier (GTX 670 etc) and so on.

So, if you are lucky, you could get a chip that passed all tests with a lot of headroom, and if you are unlucky, you can get a chip that barely passed them. Nevertheless, both GPUs will be branded the same. That's the lottery."

Furthermore, anybody who started reading Harry in the first couple years of his popularity would have aged 7-10 years by the time the last book came out, and 11-15 years by the release of the last movie. So yeah, they should definitely be aimed at 9-year-olds forever.

That said, I think 5-7 (because Goblet of Fire is more of a stepping stone between 1-3 and 5-7) were pretty well-balanced between the demographic toward which they were aimed. They were darker, yes, but not exactly more adult-oriented. I mean there was no sex of any sort and very little outright murder or extreme violence (Snape's death, Sectumsempra and Nagini's kills being all I can think of, but correct me if I am wrong) that wasn't by magic. Twilight has more overtly adult themes than Harry Potter, to be honest."

0,If you stand up right your an easy target to knock out of position. If you bend forward the goalie will push you from behind and you will end up being a nice shot blocker. Find a nice place in between that gives you lots of balance so you don't end up on the ice. Make sure your bending at the knees and your body is somewhat upright. Don't bend over like an old man. Goalies will stand up on long cycles to conserve energy but once there is enough traffic going on or they read the play and know the puck is coming they get pretty low in their stance so you don't need to be that tall.

0,"Bittorrent clients (specially qbittorrent) communicate a lot with untrusted nodes and also write files you'll eventually click/execute. This can be exploited by a remote attacker to gain complete access to your whole system. It is much more convenient for the attacker, when you run it as root, because even a minor security hole that usually would only allow him to do things with the user the bittorrent client is running as, will now let him do things being root.

An example: If an attacker makes your client write an executable and set its permissions, normally, this would let him execute malicious software with the privileges of your user account, as soon as you click it. However, if he is able to write it as root, he can set the set UID bit, so even when you click on it with your non-root user account, it would be launched with root privileges and the attacker can use it to manipulate system settings / install malware he normally could not.

This is one of the things that were criticized about windows for a long time: You had to be Administrator to do a lot of trivial things, because it was so inconvenient to launch only specific applications with different user accounts. This is a lot easier on GNU/Linux, BSD, etc.. So there usually is no need to run userspace applications being root, if they were intended to, they would make use of set UID and also should drop privileges as soon as they did all the system things (for example, a web server that needs root access to get to use port 80 should drop it afterwards for security reasons)."

0,"Nothing wrong with enlisting instead of applying to OCS -- you get to push the age limit back by at least 2 years as well, and applying from the fleet is mostly the same process with a few extra steps.  One of the toughest things about applying to OCS is the long process, and we can't even guarantee selection (so you could wait a while and then still might not get picked up).

Assuming medical clearance, I think that you would have a decent shot at SWO or NFO though, as scoring a 99 means that you would probably do pretty well on the OAR part of the test at least.  The test score for officers never expires, so you can always take the test before shipping, and then use that score in an application down the road. 

If you do decide to apply for officer after enlisting, you will want to basically be a superstar at your first command, get qualified as fast as possible, and take on extra responsibilities outside your immediate ones (even better if they are outside your division as well).  You may find that you really enjoy your job and don't want to apply for officer anyways.

TLDR:  In your situation I think that enlisting is a great idea."
0,"That's what I'm thinking as well, but I don't know how much weight my opinion has on the matter, since I'm almost entirely unfamiliar with new games. I think the only way someone could get me to truly enjoy any game beyond, say, the 5th gen, would be if it had LoK-level dialogue."

Prior to putting the lenses in the case, make sure that you clean the lens before placing it in the solution. Place the lens in the palm of your hand and place a couple drops of solution in it. Then *gently* rub both sides of the lens. This will ensure that you remove all protein and other residues.

0,"[throwaway / second account because I want to keep this stuff from my main account history]

So, this is my story:

I went to Asia for the last 2,5 years. I really liked it there so I thought I'd do a language course, because why not. Travels to Asia made me want to live there for at least a while, because I think life's too short to stay for the whole time of it in only one place. Next goal is China by the way.

So I met this girl in the language course. She's 12 years older than I am but we came along pretty well. We started writing to each other for some time and it went great. Her work is near my University so we get to meet each other every other day which is nice. 

Now 3 weeks ago I tried to make first moves in her direction. Our talks with each other started to be more personal. The atmosphere feels quite flirty between us, at least for me. Now I started talking about my ideas of leaving this country, live the dream of starting a life somewhere else. She's more of a person to stay in one place, and I can understand that but it's not for me. Not in this phase of my life. At least for now. I think here started the first differences between us. I'm at an age where I want to explore the world and see how far I can go and she's starting to feel the need for a more stable environment and stay in one place. 

We talked pretty much about this and I think that's what has made her a little bit unsure about us. 

So a view days ago, I said fuck it and asked her ""if there is anything going on between us"". She said she really likes me, but we don't match... And I agreed. The rational part of me was relieved and said:""Yes, she's right. And you won't do yourself a favor if you get yourself in an emotional dependence on her"". But the other part of me is helplessly in love. And I mean really bad in love. I can't sleep anymore. I can't think straight for a second without thinking about her. I only feel happy when I hear about her or when I'm near her. I really, really want to be just near her. I never had this before. Like my body is in actual physical pain when I can't be around her. It's bad BAD. Really BAD. 

So I'm in this situation now where I can't go back and forth. We still write each other. And as friends we come along great. But now I'm in this horrible emotional pain feeling like I made a huge mistake I can't get around. I feel like constant crying to give me some relief but it won't happen. I'm just staring at Reddit, listening to music and waiting for the time to pass. My whole body is shutting down, waiting for her next message, give me my next little fix of her attention. 

And I can't simply help it. She's such a great person. She's so indescribable beautiful. And she has such a wonderful character. I have this absurd fascination about her, it's crazy.I want to be near her. Make her feel good. Cuddle and kiss her. Stroke through her wonderful long hair. 

So what do I do now? My last resort is to just tell her:""Okay, so this is the situation, I'm absolutely in love with you. What do we do now?"" I'm pretty sure she won't be answering my feelings. Maybe even for my own sake from her point of view. And that would be okay. I wont be mad at her or give her the fault of not loving me back. 

But there is still the problem of me being this terrible lovesick teenager. I'm not functioning right now and I don't know how to go on. 

Please help me! It's 4 am right now and writing down here what goes through my head was the last idea I had. I already told some close friends what's happening but they don't have much of an advice either. 

So what do I do now?

0,"Disclaimer: I haven't dealt with Windows VPNs in years, so I don't know if this is still the case.

Not a disclaimer: Don't use your DC as a VPN server. It will be painful and you will have difficulty getting support from Microsoft if you ever need it.

When a client connects to a VPN on a Windows server, the server will assign it an IP and then route traffic to that IP as necessary. If the Windows server is configured for dynamic DNS, it will also register the IP it assigns under the server's hostname.

This will effectively multi-home your server. There's nothing inherently wrong with multi-homing a DC, but you would need to ensure that the DC is either listening on all of the IPs that clients may use to communicate with it, or you will need to manually define your DC's DNS records."

0,">  I think this is shown in the begining of the first paragraph, it doesn't make sense,

Hmmm... I think it makes sense to be honest. Let me use a crude metaphor. Let's say I was a bent stick. I can either see myself as a stick, kinda useless, a bit crooked, my bark falling off. Or I can realize I'm a branch on a beautiful tree. No longer am I a stick, now I'm a branch on this perfectly straight, tall, luscious tree. I no longer feel inadequate (not empty but full), I'm no longer old and tattered, now I have full foliage, I'm no longer just a little stick but a gigantic tree (plentiful).

Yet as a branch of the tree, I may not have the same concerns. Now my concern is being part of the tree, I don't worry about catching rain or the sun - the leaves do that. So I am uncertain, I need faith in the rest of the tree that it will support me. But that's OK.

So the sage sees this in nature and embraces it as his model. He's uncertain in all these things, but still thrives - but only by letting go of his individuality. By *surrendering* himself to the tree.

0,"As an aside. I'm totally willing to believe that indes in the Liecthenauer tradition may be independent of fuhlen. Having done a lot of Meyer in the past, I get that was very much the way things worked in his text. But my gut instinct, experience, and cursory digging I've done since Chidester posted his article is that things were actually different in the earlier texts. I just haven't seen evidence to the contrary yet."
1,Why can't they follow the scandinavian or even Scottish models for renewable energies?? this is another blow to the No campaign for Scotland. What country would want to be led by people (or ideologies) like these?

I'd also enjoy having Vic Studd on the show. And Bruce and Gwen. And you. And Hawk. Anyone really, so I don't have to have a show with just me. Makes for better ratings."

0,"There are two things I thought I didn't do well with Indie publishing that a big publisher could do for me. Firstly, editing. My main character is American but I am Australian so I had some complaints about grammar as I made her say a few things Americans wouldn't (for example - apparently Americans don't say 'towards' - they say 'toward'). I got an American friend to edit it for me after I realised this, and I thought I'd reuploaded over the old one, but apparently the first one is still the one up for sale so the grammar errors are still there. I suppose I could pay a professional to edit it for me but I just don't have the money.

The second thing I noticed about Indie publishing versus the big guys - my book came out at the same time Josephine Angelini's Starcrossed came out, and boy did her publisher saturate the media with it. The exposure they gave to that book was incredible. In some ways I think mine road on the back of that (people googling 'Starcrossed' may have come across mine too), but just the amount of hoopla they generated on the release of the book made my simple attempts at publicizing my book seem like a drop in the ocean in comparison!

Still, I do believe, if done right, indie publishing is the way of the future."
