0,"A lot of cards can have that spiral effect in the right situation, it's in the nature of the game. What makes Thaurissan good is that his effect, while potentially very powerful, can also have very middling results -- if your optimal turn 7 play cost 7 mana to begin with, it doesn't matter that it now costs 6 because the mana is wasted. In most situations you get one improved turn at the cost of playing an overbudgeted body. He's excellent, but you don't just concede when your opponent plays him.

Dr Boom is different. He's good when you're ahead, he's good when you're behind, there's no good or safe way to deal with him, only slightly less bad ways. There's no thought behind playing him at all, nothing to set up, nothing to plan for... just power and boredom."

0,"Well riot still needs to buff cleanse. Personally I think they should make it easier by giving cleanse a 1 second window of blocking cc . This way if you pop cleanse before a cc hits you, you aren't punished for jumping the gun.

If riot really likes the risk of cleanse, then they should give a jinx passive speed boost that decays after successful cleanse of cc.

Cleanse is just so bad right now because it is incredibly hard to use, most cc is a second or two long, and you have to time cleanse perfectly to successfully use it, if you a tad too late, you are punished by only cleansing half of the cc duration, and too early means you wasted cleanse basically. 

Its also pretty cool how adcarries are running exhaust now too, it is especially useful on Lucian because he doesn't have any cc. 

I think a lot of people are still trying to get used to heal, I think most people are only using it like a barrier bait, when sometimes Ill be watching a stream and see a player let a kill barely get away because they don't pop heal to catch up."

Realistically you're not going to get a cost of living adjustment that completely covers the difference in cost from New Mexico to LA, especially if that would put you above what people who live in LA already make. You're definitely within your rights to ask and they should give you something, but I wouldn't get my hopes up of getting a 30%-40% pay bump just because you move to LA."
0,"most of the replies here have some positive and negative feedback but lets break it down even further for more details and comparison.

lets tackle the first problem BAKA:

the problem with him at the moment is that his ulti needs to be used near the enemy or else that extra range you get will be nothing and that is his down side. me as a baka player prefer to leave my jump skill as an escape or chase NOT as an engage because alot can happen in a team fight. so back to the ulti, the only good side to his ulti is that is ONLY gives that extra range (not even full Range compared to the ranged carries) with faster attack speed. dont get me started on these minions you devoure THEY ARE NOTHING! they are the most WEAKEST thing i have ever seen ingame at the moment! the normal lane creeps are much more powerfull than these devoured ones thier funtion at the moment is ONLY to bodyblock and that is like the most weakest thing an ulti in general really needs in smite. therefore, the possible and most balance change to baka's ulti is that it should buff these minions not give him cc immunity cuz that is really not needed.

second problem is the ranged carry:

Anhur compared to all other carries is just the most powerful between them all because as i stated in the first post his passive + the power from his slow pillar that increase the damage + his AA gives him quite a lot of physical damage output compared to the other Ranged carries. and regarding Anhur's jump, i know that bacchus jump does a knockback but bacchus is a tank. my first comparison was comparing Anhur's jump to other carries jumps like Hun Batz, Bastet, Baka, Fenrir (does stun but only AFTER full passive and that is BS imo) so you see how OP it is on a Carry ?

Third: VAMANA

i stand by my first post that vamana can be just as powerfull as herc at the moment using some tricks. one trick is that you build him as a bruiser however add to his kit sprint and creeping curse so you be able to keep hugging the enemy all the time and benefit from your ulti. this was demonstrated in last week's tourny between Snipe and Dig where Snipe's Vamana just kept bodyblocking and hugging Dig all the time and negetated ALOT of the damage from team Dig therefore this gave Snipe a huge advantage using vamana's big baby ulti as a bodyblock. all in all. Sprint and creeping curse + vamana ulti = vamana win.

I love Patterson, and love how he makes the team better rather than be a standalone star. But the Vikings really need a strong backfield threat to compliment him, or a highly refined player opposite him â€“ similar to Greg Jennings but younger."

0,"No, nothing would happen that you'd notice.

If it's a big enough plane with enough people on board, the pilot *might* start to notice the plane bank ever so slightly to the heavier side. He'd have the trim tabs fixed to right the course before anything happened, thinking that the wind had shifted.

What *would* cause problems is if everyone on the plane moved to the rear or to the front of the plane. The effect is dependent upon the size, speed, weight of the aircraft and weight of the passengers, but it's possible they could cause the airplane to climb or descend uncontrollably.

Source: I've spent WAY too much time dicking around with the payload layout in MS Flight Simulator.

edit: I forgot to mention. In some planes (large airliners) the pilot could pump fuel to the opposite end of the plane to counter the effect. But that's only possible if there's enough empty space in the tanks to do it. However, that process takes a long time, so if the aircraft is already uncontrollable he's probably not going to think to do it and execute it within enough time to save the plane. He's also going to wonder what the fuck is going on and start asking questions to the crew."

bodyweight around 75kg, so it's not TOO bad.

I'm currently cutting and doing around an hour of cardio, I started doing this out of nothing a week ago and am now up to 1 hour from 45 minutes.

However, I'm taking so many supplements that I sometimes feel like just a walking talking bag of chems.

CLA
Green tea extract
Glutamine
Arginine
BCAA
Whey

Ephedrine will be added, along with caffeine pills as soon as I get them. They're not so legal around here so I sent them to myself from when I was in Canada. Worst case scenario they'll never get here.

And I'm pretty sure I'm forgetting some stuff somewhere.

Is it too much? Is there something I should cut out or replace?

Besides that I would also really like the fastest way to increase my endurance.

Right now mine's on par with 2 of my friends, they both have played for the past 7 years and still keep going. My calves cramp up easier then theirs but once I get past that I can easily keep up or outdo them in the lung capacity department.

I'm thinking of joining their team as well, I wouldn't mind turning some of my ""raw"" slow squats into a more explosive kind of strength. They both squat 40kg or something, my max is at least 80kg above theirs.

tl;dr

Supplement stack seems a bit much, and expensive. What to cut out/add.

Need good cardio routine, endurance is okay but nothing stellar.

Any good exercises for legs for soccer players? Could use some more explosive power."

1,"Do you realize that by taking medicine you are just doing more drugs?

You would still be yourself on meds but you would be a happy you.  The thing is with stuff like that you become addicted.  Do you want to take a happy pill all of your life?  Fuck no you don't.  Meds just cover up what the problem, not fix it.  What you need to do, like you said, is to change your lifestyle if that is what you don't like.  Try to eat healthy and try to get over being skinny.  I am very tall and slender myself.  Most people don't care and the ones that do are not the kind of people that you sound like you would want to hang out with anyway.  

The whole 'not being able to protect' thing is not really silly because it is part of your instinct.  It sounds like it just comes down to the fact that you need to start working out.  Hire a personal trainer if you have money.  Go to a gym if you have less.  And if you have none like a lot of people, maybe try and find someone who will be your 'work out buddy' and work out with them.  It will motivate you both.  If you happen to be a poor loser with no friends like me, then challenge yourself.  I.e. Next time I get my face eaten off by a zombie on dead or alive 2, I have to do 10 push ups or something.  What ever floats your boat.

Also, maybe slow down on chiefin' it up.  I get really lethargic if I get high.  Tell em you are trying to find a job or just slow down.  People usually understand and don't ask twice about it other then accidentally passin' that shit when your in the circle, but that is just being courteous, in case you change your mind or something.

As for the whole womans thing.  You can't find love if you have none for yourself.  There is a whole host of reasons for this but suffice to say people pick up on that.  Also, love is rare.  Just start talkin to ladies and what not and they will warm up to you.  After that, if you poke em' you poke em' and that is all you can do.  

Summarized version of the a fore told ramble:  Get a work out buddy or maybe challenge your self (I can smoke one more bowl if I do 100 jumping jacks).  Don't confuse happiness with being high from meds or street drugs.  Smoke less pot.  Love + you = love + hot bitch across the street."

0,"There are several assumptions I've made when looking at this battle:

- Alex is the Alex from the end of Prototype 1, Heller is the Heller from just before the canon battle with Mercer.

- Both have all of their abilities maxed out.

- The fight takes place in the Red Zone from Prototype 2.

- Alex cannot summon infected to fight for him.

- Devastators, consuming infected to regain health, Bio-Bombs and Pack leader are not taken into account until round 6.

- Alex can use Infected Vision to find Heller (I'm assuming that he can do that even if Heller hides among the Infected) and Heller can use his Hunting Pulse to find Mercer. This is useful if either fighter runs away at some point and the other has to give chase.

- In round 6, both combatants can switch powers on the fly and are not limited by selecting the power in-game.

Alright let's get this party started.

- **Round 1: Fists only**

In terms of bare fists, Heller only had basic punching, a heavy kick and an air kick. Mercer on the other hand has a much more diverse arsenal. He has basic punches and basic kicks that he can mix up, he can charge all of these for more damage, he has terrific AoE attacks with Knuckle Shockwave and his Ground Pound, his air kick goes much further than Heller's and does more damage... Besides that he also has Palm Slam as a good attack to use from a distance where Heller won't be able to hit Alex with his fist attacks. Mercer also has air combos and a very powerful charged punch on the third hit that will send Heller flying. Finally, Mercer has the cannonball (which hits like an absolute truck) and the Divebomb. Although Heller also has that attack, Mercer's version is far more powerful if used from high up. Overall, Mercer's arsenal with fists is far more versatile and he has something for every situation. Heller has very few attacks to work with and no good way to get Alex out of his face (such as the Knuckle Shockwave). I'd have to say **Alex 9/10** in this scenario, although I can't give a good scenario where Heller will be able to outsmart Mercer enough for him to take the remaining 1/10. 

- **Round 2: Claws only** 

Mercer's basic claw attacks do little damage. Against Hunters, its damage is sub-par, not doing *that* much more than bare fists can do. Mercer's most important tool here are th Groundspiked. This will track Heller from the ground and do pretty good damage to him, although it's telegraphed if he charged it. Still, Mercer can do uncharged ground spikes as a reasonable way to get damage in on Heller, if Heller doesn't dodge it however, because the recovery on Groundspikes is quite long.

Heller's claws on the other hand are a lot better. His Claws do noticably more damage than Alex's, if Brawlers and Hunters are compared, and claw pounce is a lot more practical than Groundspikes are. The spikes are Alex's answer to armored vehicles and Hunters, with the regular slices being better for dealing with regular soldiers and infected. Heller's Claw Pounce, while not being very good vs tanks, has incredible range to it, especially when fully upgraded. If Mercer ever misses a Groundspike attack and is dealing with the recoveryvon it, Heller could get a free Pounce in for good damage. The key here is that because Alex's basic claw attacks are quite weak, he *will* have to rely on Groundspikes for most of the fight, which Heller can punish him for.

I'd say this goes to **Heller 8/10**. Groundspikes aren't that practical versus a fast-moving Prototype and it's the only thing he'll get good damage from. Heller has much better Claw powers and will be able to easily give chase to Mercer if he decides to run away from Heller. The 2/10 I see Mercer taking is only when he manages to keep himself away from Heller without getting tagged by the Pounce too often and if he manages to land a good number of Groundspikes without getting Pounced for it. The spikes have pretty good vertical range, so it's not like it's an entirely free dodge for Heller. Still, Heller wins by quite a lot here.

- **Round 3: Whipfist only**

I haven't used the Whipfist in Prototype 2 too much yet, because it's a pretty late-game power. As such I may be missing some details on Heller's version here. I'd say the two Prototypes have a very similar Whipfist though. Both have immense range with their heavy attack, so hit-and-run tactics are not an option. Both have normal attacks also with very good range, so I imagine that they will likely never stay in each others' face as to have a better chance of dodging the other's Whipfist.

Because the two powers are so similar, I think it largely comes down to what else they're capable of. In this specific round, I'd say their respective personalities play a big part. Alex is relatively calm when fighting and slightly (emphasis on slightly) more tactical than Heller is. Heller is more hot-headed, fueled by anger. I think Alex will likely run away from Heller to get more of an advantage when it comes to where they're fighting as opposed to Heller. Heller will never run away because of his personality and will mercilessly give chase to Mercer. This does mean that because Heller is so focused on the chase, he may forget if Mercer is trying to bait him into something. For instance, Mercer tries running away and Heller tries to grab him with his Whipfist. Right before it hits him, Mercer throws something in front of Heller's Whip and proceeds to do his own Whipfist heavy attack, which may tag Heller because he's trying to get rid of the barrel or whatever Mercer threw at him.

All in all, I'd say **Alex Mercer 6/10**. The two have a very similar Whipfist, so it comes down to whether Alex outsmarting Heller will work out. Heller is not an idiot though and will likely not fall for the same trick twice. I'd say because of Heller's hot-headedness, Mercer has a slight advantage in this round.

- **Round 4: Hulk Hands only**

Let's just get out of the way that Heller has a better light attack, heavy attack and air heavy attack. Heller's Hammerfist do more damage, his heavy attack is a million times better than Alex's. Heller's heavy summons a large wave of groundspikes that does good damage, but most noticably it has a lot of horizontal and vertical range to it. It has slow-ish recovery however, so if Alex does manage to dodge it (because Heller's groundspikes don't track, jumping sideways is a good way to dodge it), he can go in for the punish. Heller's air heavy is also extremely good. It gives Heller great AoE spikes that do good damage to Mercer. While Mercer should be able to jump out of the way fairly easily, if he gets tagged by it (which is very possible considering its massive range) he'll definitely feel it.

However, besides the fact that Mercer's air elbow slam does more damage than Heller's, Alex has a trick up his sleeve: Hammertoss. After a decently long charge time, Alex charges a fuck ton of speed up in his body and launches himself into the air with the Hammerfist at the front. While I'm going to ignore the ridiculous tracking it has in-game, I'm still going to assume that Alex has decent control over where he's going with it (sorta like gliding). This attack does a truck load of damage, I'm talking a TRUCK load of damage. The charging in itself also gives Mercer a decent speed, which may help him in being able to dodge Heller if he intends to punish the charge of the Toss. The punish can happen with Heller's Grondspikes well enough because of its large range, being able to hit Alex before he gets close to Heller.

So basically, if Alex can hit Heller with like 2 Hammertosses, Alex will have a major advantage. Whether he can do that or not is the question. If Heller can jump very high very quickly once he sees the Toss coming, he'll be able to avoid it, but he likely won't be able to punish it. I'd say **James Heller 6/10** here. Heller's Hammerfist arsenal is overall more solid, but Hammertoss is a really really good ability. Not 5/10 because Alex is quite reliant on Hammertoss and once Heller figures out how to deal with it, he'll have an edge."
0,"I'm gonna urge some caution here. Testing shuffling methods to try to achieve a certain kind of ""spread"" is deck-stacking. You're allowed to reorganize cards in your waiting room at will (as long as new cards hitting the waiting room are initially placed on top, and the cards remain as one stack), but when refreshing, you have to shuffle to the point that the original order of cards from the WR is irrelevant.

If you organize cards a specific way in your WR, your opponent has every right to expect an extremely thorough shuffle from you afterward, so that no pattern of cards can be expected to exist in your deck. (Also, waiting until refresh time to reorganize the WR is unacceptable since you have to refresh immediately)

The people who live outside the city and drive in have larger suburban houses (usually) and they have cars. That's a benefit in itself. Why on top of that should their parking spaces be cheap or free if the real cost of providing those spots (economically and environmentally) is actually quite high? We wouldn't give those same people free bus passes. The buses and stations cost money to operate. Parking spaces are the 'stations' or 'terminals' of auto travel in a sense."
0,"I got mine at a well-known electronics market in Seoul. They sell new and second hand and if you bring a Korean or can speak fluently (I can't, I brought my friend), you can haggle a pretty good deal. I got the body, 18-55mm kit lens, UV filter, HD SD card, bag, etc for less than $850 (USD). There are markets like that in a lot of countries, but I don't know any other specific places. Akihabara in Tokyo is another well known electronics mecca, but I don't know what kinds of prices you can get there. I think it should be similar to where I got mine.

You probably won't stand out as much as you think with your camera, even a big one, but I know what you're saying. A good travel tip that I've come across in several different places is to put some black tape across any brand logos or names on whatever equipment you end up getting and to get another neckstrap for your camera. The ones that come in kits have brand names and models stamped all over them. 

If you want a warranty and all of the bells and whistles that come from buying a piece new/in your country of residence, just buy it in Australia.  However, I'd recommend buying something used, if you can and you can find somewhere reputable. That'll minimize risk on your investment if (God-forbid) something happens on your travels, and you might find it more approachable to use. Another reason I went for mirrorless -- it's not as huge or has many dials and stuff as a DSLR. They have all the same functions etc, but I think the user experience is a little more friendly to a beginner. To use my SO as an example again, he went for a 60D because it's a highly regarded model, but he didn't know much about how to use one. He left it in his case for the first four months after buying it because it seemed too complicated. :P

I'd also recommend going to a store to see different options. You might do a bunch of research online and think you've found the one you want, but when you go to hold it, the balance is all off or the view finder isn't where you want etc. It's much easier to see them in person. I had my heart set on the Olympus OMDE5, but when I got to the store and handled a NEX, my opinion immediately changed. That's a potential drawback if you're trying to find bargains at used markets in Asia. They might not have all the models you're interested in comparing etc. 

This is a pretty good online store for cameras: http://www.bhphotovideo.com/
Sometimes they have really good sales and they have interesting bundles.

And this is a photography website that has a bunch of different articles about photography and gear. I really like their articles because they're short and direct. I've learned a lot from them. They also have a forum where you could probably get some more answers from.

He's still in that gray, ""They could sue us"" area. Following coworkers around isn't illegal, and more than one suit has turned this into, ""The coworkers were bullying the guy who got fired! He's the victim!"" I mean, a younger me who worked at a grocery store as a bag / cart monkey had to deal with a guy who should not have still been a bag boy at his age- 30 or so- and was both crude and obnoxious to work around, was frequently late to work, but was completely willing to do *anything* at work, including cleaning up shit tsunamis in the restrooms, cleaning clogged pipes, and working the bottle return. Because he wasn't *physically* doing anything wrong, management had to stress that he was always about one fuck up away from getting fired.

0,"While Asurion is nice, as a previous CSR rep, I know quite a lot of horror stories. Asurion will sometimes send defective devices, but say they're ""CLNR"" clearly if the battery overheats/dies in the first 15minutes of trying to activate it...it wasn't tested properly.

Asurion has also made me as a CSR rep, and the customer go to war with them. The customer had an Ipad Air, it got stolen. He had insurance which was added on the day of purchase, he called to make a claim, Asurion said ""We cannot verify any usage, therefore we will not honor the claim"". Fair enough...

I check the bill, and I see his Tablet line on the bill has data usage. I check the MDN/Equipment history to make sure no other devices were assigned to that number, so that data usage recorded on the bill was accurate, and was from the Ipad Air. 

I had to call Asurion with the customer on the line, and escalate to 3 different Asurion reps, and explain to them as a person from Verizon's side, our information checks out, and everything is fine. There should be NO issue to make this claim, infact if you would like I can reprint this bill validating the usage, and have the customer fax/send/email it to you guys if necessary.

Eventually the 3rd guy said ""OH...I SEE...I SEE THIS IS AN IPAD WE ARE LOOKING FOR MINUTE AIRTIME!!"" ""Sir...an Ipad has a specific feature that hotlines any voice/phone calls, it's an Ipad....not an Iphone"". He apologized, and made the claim. 20 minutes of my time, 2hrs of the customers time wasted.

I'd honestly look at getting Insurance through one of those premium retailers, I hear places like Diamond Wireless are good from what I hear. In store device replacement, and a lot of them are new. "

**Backstory**

I quit University at 21 just before I had finished to go and work abroad (8 hours plane journey from my home country). I have been working abroad now for almost 2 years - and I really enjoy my job - the sense of freedom it brought with it (own apartment/new city) is refreshing as well.

I am still in a relationship with a girl I met at University and I have strong feelings for her (she's the first girl i've said ""I love you"" to). I have seen her twice since I left University for my job.

When I got over here, the freedom I had made me want to explore and I was pretty lonely, only being friends with people at work. So I met someone from an online dating site, initially just for friends, but after 6 months we started hooking up and we have been having sex ever since. I have never told this other girl about my girlfriend.


**My Issues**

I am so afraid of hurting people and of being alone that I continue to live this ""double"" life and it's slowly hurting me - i've had panic attacks for no reason - and I don't have anyone else to blame but myself.

I can't ever let my girlfriend come over here as I am sure she'd find out about this other girl some way.

I don't know what I should do - and I am constantly trying to forget it all, but its starting to hurt me as a person (I am lying more and more).

What should I do?

Even if he's going with the whole downgrade for now idea the lowest card he should downgrade to is probably a 390.

The upside

1)Potentially better return once next lineup is out and when DX12 is more prevalent and 390 maintain its value better.

The downside

1)Transaction costs: the cost of selling/shipping a 980 Ti, the cost of buying a 390 now and the future cost of selling said 390 to upgrade again. You are going to lose on the margin on 2 cards as well as paying shipping for them.

2)Huge current performance loss.

So while I see where you are coming from and have considered the exact same thing. I don't think at the end of the day its worth it unless potential $$ is more important than current enjoyment. And I'd like to think for people who paid $600+ for a GPU current enjoyment is an important consideration."

2. Inferno Fork - Huge damage against stationary mobs, great AOE but travels slowly making it impractical for constant use.


3. Spectre Staff - High base damage and homes, but it's just a single target DPS weapon. Most boring of the 3 IMO.


Leaf blower isn't on the list since it's more of a boss-killing weapon than anything. Works great with Spectre heals so it's good for boss fights, but honestly the Laser Machinegun is a direct upgrade so I wouldn't really bother with it unless you get it early."

0,"Finally dumping a clingy-as-hell, fucked-up-as-hell ex-girlfriend.

She was autistic. She was also dealing with depression issues, a shitty family, couldn't seem to get along with anyone else for whatever reason, and (to hear her story) a really, REALLY SHITTY high school.

But she also blamed her problems - poor/failing grades, not getting up in the mornings, homework, everything - on everyone and everything but herself. And all she ever did about it was cry. Cry, and cling to me even more. Now, I'm okay with crying every now and again. But I can't stand it 24/7. I can't deal with that. I tried to support her, tried to help her... but all she did was cry and cling and play the blame game more and more. I'm not even sure if she ever told me the truth much, if at all. Like I never heard the other side of the story; namely, that maybe she just wasn't trying or applying herself.

And yet, I couldn't bring myself to get rid of her because 1) She was my first-ever real girlfriend (I'd NEVER had that kind of interest before in my life!) at the age of 18 and 2) She was fucked-up in a lot of ways, but she had nice tits and she did share my interests in video games and nerdy stuff like that. And most importantly... I was way, WAY too wishy-washy on decisions like these. I kept hanging on, letting her hang on, dragging me down with her.

And then, it finally got so bad that she dropped out of college. And FINALLY, I grew a pair and admitted that this just wasn't working. Was it wrong of me to detach myself as the only real lifeline this depressive basket case had? Maybe... but I had to take care of myself, and she sure as hell wasn't making things easy. And it was clear that nothing I did worked with her. So I let her go, and eventually got her out of my life entirely.

I wonder about her sometimes - whether she actually grew the fuck up and turned it around, or finally snapped and hung herself. If the former, great, and I'm glad she did. If the latter, well... I'm no angel. If you're looking to me as your savior, you'd damn well better look somewhere else.

Ironically, her being a basket case may have saved me on another matter at that time: I thought math teaching would be a good idea, but it really wasn't. I was too shy and nervous and the kids knew it. I couldn't handle teaching. Yet I kept playing make-believe... until finally, I got a shitty review from a teacher on my fieldwork, complaining that I always came in tired (due to my clingy ex). I finally admitted that I'd been thinking that maybe teaching wasn't right for me. My professors then and there encouraged me to consider other options. I did... and never looked back. And I am SO GLAD I didn't go into teaching.

Now I always think that one of the most important things in life is to know what you want. If you don't, you act like an idiot like I did."

1,"Hey guys, I wanted to know your opinion on what the implications are of a 17 year old (girl) dating a 19 year old (guy), with no sex going on. I just got out of a couple month relationship with this girl, and sex was never brought up. It was more of mutual conversation and (potentially) building a life together-IE if she wanted marriage, family, etc. 

I know that in some states, that having sex under 18 is okay, but would having a relationship like this be acceptable to society and in the law? I'd like to know for future reference. I ended it because I thought the age would be a barrier, and that I did not want to get myself into any bad situation should things get heated."

0,"This seems like a logical explanation, thank you. However, another question arises then: ""promoting"" something about a lifestyle (like a certain type of figure) isn't the sole purpose of these pictures; quite often, it's also a selling point (or just an ""eye candy"", you know). I'm not sure how airbrushing could be bad from this angle. When it comes to judging a picture purely by how neat it looks (instead of what message it carries), a touched up picture that hides this or that flaw is better, isn't it?

And since there's this type of benefit for at least some of such pictures (that is, the ones that aren't actually about ""ladies, this is how you should look""), why should it be forbidden / frowned upon? A rather random example, but I'm sure that 95% of Internet users in the US don't know what's a VPN. The other 5% might use it for ""good"" purposes and for ""evil"" purposes. Would it make sense to ban VPN usage nationwide? Would it make sense to ban anything that *does* have a ""good"" side of how you can use it (and no one forces you to use it at all)? Back on topic, would it make sense to ban unrealistically skinny images if they have at least one ""valid"" usage (eye candy for someone) and no one is forcing them down people's throats as the only standard of beauty?

After all, there's also a question of personal preference. Some people may like unrealistically thin girls, some might even like anime-drawn girls... Just because someone finds this specific type of figure extremely attractive, doesn't mean that they will demand and judge ""realistic"" girls based on their ideals. Almost everyone knows how to separate fantasy from reality."

If you've ever tried to to a traceroute before, you'll see that the Internet is basically a Union-Find Disjoint Set. 2 servers will be on the same network with nothing more than a tenuous link.

0,"It's still pretty soon to talk about Lapis but let's compare their skills from an AoE, stun, base dmg and cd perspective for ToA: 
 
1. Lapis has 1 less cd on 3rd and 2nd skill. His second skill AoE disturbs hp recovery but it's not 100% and it's random, while tyron it's full AoE. For ToA floor where I need HP disturb I would rather use briand. 
2. When talking about despair procs and stuns I think tyron might be better (unless you have crazy speed on lapis), since both of his AoE full area and his third skill is a 100% freeze (before resistnce), from my experience, using tyron+baretta+vero is almost 2-3 or even 4 stunned turns on 3-4 man or full enemie team.
3. Better multipliers on lapis but overall more utility on tyron. If you want a DD you might better consider sigmarus (who even has AoE and can freeze in att build) or another one, lapis att base is pretty low. 
4. Tyron leader skill is awesome everywhere, and in general, you can still farm with tyron with his despair/focus build. Yes, 24% att boost from lapis is ok, but not that much when you need healers/veromos/baretta/rezzers on high floors of ToA.

I feel lapis cries for despair set, but he don't have as much utility as tyron may give you. But again, I'm only theoryzing, too soon to judge a 1 day born mons.

So cars obviously have a certain amount of icons that can be in the ""Trunk"" for storage. I was thinking, cars could have a medium initial amount of max storage. The more open seats in the car, the more the ""Trunk"" can hold. Say you have all your storage taken up and another person tries to get in. It could give them the message ""There isn't enough space in this car."" Or something like that. In the future, trucks could possibly have more initial storage, then offroaders, then police cars.
Nerfs police cars, gives more reason to trucks (because as of now people can shoot from any car, so the truck is just a slower car with less seats)
This also helps solo players and gives groups a disadvantage. I'm all for it, despite the fact that I play with a group of 7 others.

We can keep playing decent and make the first round and lose (on top of not developing guys) but what is the point of that? We've been always stuck in this middle road for the whole franchise history (outside of 1 year) where we're either late lottery or going to the first round and losing. I think there need to be a change and I'm glad that Ujiri pointed out that he understands our history and will make sure we will not get stuck in the middle again. I trust him so I'll wait and see what he does to get us past the first round or help us tank/get high lotto pick.

I would say: simply stick to making clear that it is your _opinion_, based on your subjective experience. Thus, the relevant claim is not ""The vast majority of feminists are X"", but ""Over my life, I've found that, in spite of their official protestations to the contrary, feminists do tend to end up being X.""

Online insertion and removal (OIR) is a feature that allows you to replace CF memory cards without turning off the router and without affecting the operation of other interfaces. OIR of CF memory cards provides uninterrupted operation to network users, maintains routing information, and ensures session preservation.
 

The external CF memory card should not be removed if the flash memory busy ""CF"" LED on the router is ON, because this indicates that the software is accessing the CF memory card. Removing the CF memory card may disrupt the network, because some software features use the CF memory card to store tables and other important data. "

0,"HH Scott was one of the top golden age tube brands, and the 299 is a pretty highly regarded model.  Looks like it uses 7189s for the output tubes, which is the same as my Sherwood.  The 7189 is a high voltage EL84 and is a very sweet sounding tube.  If the restoration passes the sniff test, I'd go for it.  They should be willing to open up the chassis and show you the work they did.  The restoration stuff is important.

0,"I think most of you are thinking about both wrong. 

Google Ads and Bing Ads (you should be using both) - Use this to build your traffic up, convert tire kickers to potential leads (offer them something for their email address) and use it to see what people are actually doing on your website (heatmaps - google analytics). Monitor what pages are doing best and optimize those pages to help decrease bounce rate and increase website engagement

SEO - AT THE SAME TIME YOU ARE DOING ADS, DO SEO AS WELL. 
See who is ranking for your keywords. Look at their backlink profile. Whereever they are, you should try to be. Did they do a guest post? Find out if it has a comment section and make an educated blog comment with a link to your website. 

Depending on what you're selling, you'll probably see a lot of citations, directory submissions, blog posts, etc. Try to copy exactly what they do. They are on the first page for a reason. 

After that, get your content strategy together. Post to your blog as much as you can, and create lists that will help with your SEO. See who has the ""biggest list"" and make yours bigger and better. Then check whereever that ""biggest list"" has links from, and reach out to those who mention that ""biggest list"". You are now the biggest list on the block. If they're smart, they'll link to your article as well. Make it better as far as visually appealing, better content, bigger list. 

After that, you'll want to get some link building going from high authority blogs. Use Page Authority / Domain Name Authority / Moz Ranking / Trust Flow as key indicators of what you want. There are several people selling this type of blogs. Don't be fooled of what you've heard from other people - this still works. 

Finally, try to get on blogs/websites that are CLOSELY RELATED TO YOUR NICHE. Getting links from generic blogs, etc. won't help you as much as a proper niche website/blog will do. Even blog comments still work! Look for low outbound links if you're going to do blog comments. 

Here's why you need to do both SEO and Ads at the same time: 

- Ads bring you guaranteed traffic while you're building SEO. While you are paying for traffic, it will give you key analytics and traffic to help you make your website better. Not making sales? This should tell you something. Start split testing while you're running the ads. Make sure you are doing your ads correct. You should be doing exact match or phrase and not broad. 

- While your ads are running, build up your SEO. Try to do it nice and steady, and once you hit the front page for key terms that you want, you can start taking your ad budget down a little at a time. Traffic you get from SEO doesn't cost you anything once you're there (only maintaining the rankings). 

View Ads as a 100 YD Dash, View SEO as a 50 mile marathon. 

Hope this helps.

0,"Post pics please! We can probably match the piece to the engine diagram if it is in fact a piece from your engine.

I'm drawing a blank as to what engine part that could be. The thing about engines is that every piece in it is needed, so in theory if there was a piece that came lose, your bike's engine would be in bad shape, or something wouldn't be working correctly. 

I'm taking a guess here, but it could be something that was accidentally left in the engine the last time the case was open, or maybe it's been in there since the day it was built in the factory. 

I've never taken apart a KTM, so I'm not too familiar with the individual pieces that make up the engine, so take my guess with a grain of salt. 

Does the bike sound good when running? Does it shift through all the gears well? "

1,"In general traditional rabbinic Judaism encourages a horizontal society, the more educated the masses are in Torah the better off we all are. Indeed Hazal authorized an official Aramaic targum (translation) and deemed it a weekly obligation to review alongside of a double reading of the weekly portion. Indeed in a case of lifeboat ethics, a mamzer who transformed himself into a Talmid Hakham takes priority over that of a Kohen! Traditional rabbinic Judaism does not generally see a proper Torah education as threatening. Quite the contrary it sees it as a strength and indeed personal obligation. 

That said, I don't know if there was any rabbinic response to Luther's translation however a better testcase would be Mendelssohn's translation. There was indeed some rabbinic opposition to it on the grounds that a) it was written in a very technical German rather than in a style more accessible to the masses and b) it could become too much of a crutch and may prevent people from pursuing a proper understanding of the text in the native Hebrew. As you can see in both reasons for opposition the concern was not that the Jewish masses will become too educated but to the contrary that they will not be sufficiently educated."

1,"Yeah yeah, I've heard that before. While the issue of corporate control of water resources is a big problem, and Nestle is a pretty shitty company, that quote is taken wildly out of context.

0,"Nope, as follows:

1. Plug one of the units into the power socket near your router - Connect this unit to the router using any standard ethernet cable

2. Plug the other unit into the power socket where you want access to the internet - Connect this unit to the device you want to use using an ethernet cable

TLDR: turns your houses power cables into an ethernet cable

Of course theres a bunch of variables such as different housing circuits and quality/age of the power cables in your walls - so every bodies mileage varies, but on the whole results are extremely positive - I get 170mb from my TP Link set and a ping of 18 to Teamspeak with a jitter of three ms :)"

I've watched a good amount of episodes of Steven Universe and I just can't get into it. The characters are just so annoying and uninteresting to me. When people say they don't like Adventure Time because they build up stories just to have things go back the way they were, I think of Steven Universe. Very little has actually changed. Like Adventure Time, they foreshadow major events in little ways in multiple episodes. I don't see a difference between the two

I would not say that Season 7 has Adventure Time on a ""cliche and unoriginal"" path at all. People just want a pay-off from seasons worth of plots and I get that. But it makes the wait that much better. There are still a number of plots to explore: Maja and the elephant, the backstory to the Mushroom War, Ice King and the crown, Betty, The Lich/Sweet P, the impending future apocalypse, Prismo seems to be getting more involved, the possible threat of GOLB, Jake's mom/dad thing, Finn's mom, how PB built and sustained her kingdom, Finn's origins, Susan Strong, Gunter/Orgalorg. I could go on and on

I see Season 7 as a mix of Season 6 and 5. Stakes was very symbolic. I think it's too early to write off this season as unoriginal  "

0,"I don't even know where to start, I'm terribly shaking writing this (I'm normally a lurker). But I nearly perfectly fit the description of the ""best friend straight guy"" that u/noirsky is talking about. See his topics here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/21hoho/is_my_close_friend_really_straight/
http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/244qdy/best_friends_girlfriend_told_me_hes_gay/
http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/28ylwm/setting_boundaries_with_confused_straight_best/

Its slightly confusing, as there are some discrepancies, but if you Noirsky, are my ""gay best friend"" then I know you are also smart enough to slightly twist reality. So because of that, I will try to make a response as if you are, and if you are not it will be a bit of self help for me.

I came to this reddit because I needed some advice on how to deal with my gay best friend, who seems to be holding back. So how it came to this point: 6 years ago I met him at a university woodworking club, I was intrigued by him and his ambience, he has an amazing natural dominance over other people, he was cool, hip and he was guy I could learn from. I susspected he was gay, but it took a year or what to confirm it, never noticed it on him, and just considerd him as a friend. 

5 Years ago I had a relationship that ended with a bang (she cheated), I was at the point of going emotional MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction), and then he intervened, I'm very thankfull that he did as I had some recovering to do, this is when he became a rolemodel in my life, this is also the first time I explored ""gayness"" as an option through some chatroulette. But I ened up in a long term relationship quite quickly, not a single bad word about our ""bisexual"" girlfriend"", but when she moved in with me I ended up in a bromance with him (although I didn't even realize it was a bromance at this point). During parties with a very open atmosphere, I started teasing/playing with males with an equal aproach as I would tease females, because hey hippy-culture-equality that is fair playground. This slowly developped and over the last year I developped the mindset that I wanted to pursue a gay experience. I had no clue how to set this up, arrange this, or even go about making this a thing. I felt reluctant to simply ""use/ask"" my gay best friend, his friendship was way to valuable for me, it always feels like an ""everything is acceptable"" ""everything is good"" atmosphere, though we did slowly explore this during booze induced parties and there was some ""accidental"" (read intentional) groping from my end involved, though he never returned the favor. 

But 2 months ago, things changed, call it an alignment of the stars or the universe folding in on itself or a wrestling match, but I felt a moment so intimate, so in love with my best friend, it was so incredably beautifull, and I still feel it all the time since then, and especially after we've been together for an evening. The days after I ""felt straight guy turned gay"" I gained a perspective I've never had before, a light to shine onto all my past memories. In all the male friends that I had I could see this energy of ""male love"". Or all the dressingroom interactions I've had, or the sheer amount of bromances/special friends. For me it felt like an unlock of insight. 

But this type of love seems to diminish if talked about, because when you start talking you start to make demands if only implicitly, but for the both of us demands are like the root of all evil, we cherish our freedom and the lack of people telling us what we can not do. This is in our normal life,  When we are together I see something in his eyes, and I got the idea that he might be secretly in love with me all this time. I tried to reach out to him about this, but he bounced me a few times, and I'm unsure why this is, is he unsure of me because of my undefined/closeted sexuality, does he want to preserve our friendship, is he afraid of his own feelings. Is he safegaurding his private space that he always tells me he does with other gays, is he segregating ""playtime/booze""-roles from the rest of our lives. Am I not his type.  

I used to be sure of my sexuality as straight and through my openmindedness fully accepting people as being gay (also within my family and upbringing), through this openmindedness I also accepted myself doing gay things. But with females arousal and sexual atraction/fantasies comes fast, with males it requires a higher visual attraction and set and setting. From this I have to conclude I'm at least bisexual, though I see sexuality much more as a liquid. On an emotional/spiritual level females have never been able to connect to me in a way that was constructive, whereas my best friend has.

Typing this out, made me all soft and mushy weepy feelings again, because I do genuinely have feelings for him, I might be in the blue on my ""true"" sexuality, I'd just wish we'd hug and cuddle more."
