Sometimes I wear shorts or a very short dress because itâ€™s hot outside and I want to be as cool & comfortable as possible. Not because I want to sexualize my body and my look, and certainly not because I want random strangers to compliment or touch me. So, no, women donâ€™t always want to dress a certain way in order to be sexualized. When you see someone who looks super sexy itâ€™s fine to think â€œwow theyâ€™re sexyâ€ but you donâ€™t have the right to touch them in any way. Simple, really.

Nafta spurred economic growth as the US was ramping up to profit off its implementation, but as the policy matured the result was clear, Wall St profits would go up and wages and benefits would go down."

You're arguing semantics about secession, and whether it makes the rebel stars and bars traitorous to display? I'll point out one thing, under the eyes of the Union, when Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation it applied to ""all"" slaves in the secessionist states as well. Your trying to make an argument that the Confederacy was making after seceding. Because they wanted to be seen as a new nation. They weren't before that, it was all a ploy to keep they're slaves and not have to adhere to Federal Government. Get over it, they lost, so if you want to believe that way, fine.....that's the way it was, until the Union was re-united. See, the government never recognized the Confederacy as a nation, that's why it was treasonous. All you needed to say was, it isn't treasonous to display the flag in your own private property."

Taylor Swift shouldn't have to respond to me if for example I make a video claiming that her music videos are full of satanic imagery that compels people to murder the elderly, any articles paying any credence to my video without supporting evidence isn't journalism but mere click seeking and that should be the real story not Swift's lawyer doing his or her job."

One is a grandpa, which is Joe Biden.Hunter Biden I think is a father. Hey Hunter Biden you look just like your daddy, in it is younger years of Joe Biden!!!! 
P.S. word of advice.If Joe Biden needs help speaking on a national TV. The people from news Fox Business should give him a teleprompter or script to read from to make it easier for Joe Biden.If they don't like the way Joe Biden speaks on TV. Anyways I think Joe Biden has a nice family. They seem like they're nice people but I don't know for sure. Joe Biden kind of reminds me of my grandfather. I think the people in government should help Joe Biden manage the White House better so that he's doing his job more correctly and efficiently in all areas of the government. The bottom line is 
I think they all need to work together the Republicans and the Democrats, to be on the same page,to get things done the right way,amen. I really miss my grandpa tremendously,!!!! Take care, best of wishes to you's. I just hope and pray that everything works itself out but the people in the government to work together not against each other. P.S. My grandfather would say two hands make light work.With that being said everybody needs to put their minds together all politicians,Democrats,the Republicans,and etc people to get things really accomplished there in the White House of government in Washington DC.
Well anyways have a great day,!!!! God Bless You's All White House Government There in Washington DC. I really hope things get better with our country in all areas of government, no matter who's in charge,amen. Keep America safe,& well protected on all sides of the government, and the border completely because we need it.

Why didn't You have them held accountable for the Slander, misleading the Americans, treasonous acts , endangering our lives for their own agendas. Pelosi is seen in a video .when a reporter asked her Why didn't Congress  let the Stimulus go through when the Trump Administration first created it before the Holidays when so many families were in dire need  yet NOW after the holidays they did. She simply said Well there's a different President!!! how about that? No care for the poor families that desperately were trying to  have a Holiday for their children , that were maybe laid off , behind in their rent, worried about putting food on the table or if they'd be going back to work  . Pelosi held us hostage to make it look like it went through under the Biden Administration. That takes a very deranged , desperate human being to that.. i can go on here but i'm getting sick over it. I think the Republicans let them get away with way too much."

As a transwoman with a checkered past of illicit drug consumption and participation in all that comes with it, PLEASE help change drug law policies. 

Harm reduction is the best approach to helping the world reduce the carnage brought about by criminalizing the health issues of dependence/addiction. The fact that drugs are readily available in prisons, should be a clue as to how the drug war has been permanently won, by drugs.

I survived using Boy, girl, rock and raw on the streets of Baltimore's West Side. The best way to help is to offer pure medical grade heroin to maintenance people. This would bring people addicted to opiates under the wings of medical personnel. Saving people from the streets. 

The DEA sucks billions of tax dollars, pumps people with addictions straight into the private prison industry, to build $8,000.00 desks for people like South Dakota Governor Kirsti Noem. Isn't that special?

No, try, disgusting. Surely none of those sweet bikers at Sturgis were using drugs. 😕 But you know, they don't  live in the projects, where the bad people are...hunted...daily.

We lost a wonderful actor when Michael K. Williams passed. We will lose thousands more people today. Tomorrow. And on and on.

Only 321 people have commented here. Please  share this person's death and what harm reduction, all drug decriminalization, drug maintenance programs can do to save lives.

It may be someone you loves turn to die next."

1,"The most bonkers part about all of this that no one seems to ever point out, is the obvious violation of church and state. ANY law involving abortion inherently is an extension of the churches values, they only make arguments based on it being against THEIR faith.

1,"This is nothing but political posturing and marketing.

Lyft is battling their Straw Man.

They're promising to help defend their drivers from the no-danger-whatsoever that they're in.

Effective marketing, though.  They're trying to drum up business by making a promise that's guaranteed to cost them nothing.  They put out a statement and are letting left-wing ""news"" sources handle their advertising costs."
1,"Writing in the Washington Post, Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone called abortion “a great moral evil” and “the most pressing human rights challenge of our time.” The archbishop of San Francisco also invoked the excommunication of prominent Catholic segregationists in the early 1960s as an example of a legitimate response to Catholic lawmakers who support abortion today."

1,"Why does a person get charged with double murder if they kill a pregnant woman? If you don't consider the fetus, human and a live person....? Just asking how this makes sense... and we'll, asking for a friend.......

If the driver knows... isn't he accessory before the fact under a murder law? Or different rules here? Again, asking for a friend."
1,Texas is a joke among jokes.
1,"Looks like cheap virtue signaling publicity for Uber and Lyft as I highly doubt there will be any Uber or Lyft drivers sued over this.     And I am more than happy to admit I was wrong if that ever happens.

And even if a driver is sued, Uber and Lyft's legal departments have probably advised their Board of Directors and executives that such a case would likely be easily dismissed.    I don't think there is any precedent for this and they know that.

What are the damages even?  Some random person is just going to sue some lyft driver for a gazillion dollars because they drove somebody else to an abortion clinic?    

Think critically people.  This is all so vague and full of holes, none of this is going to happen.  It's literally political theater on both sides."
1,This lawsuit is so ass backwards

Then they were shown a film of an ""actual abortion.""  They nearly all changed their previous opinion.  Whenever you have to alter the ""reality"" to new terms such as ""a woman's right to choose; or it's a woman's healthcare decision"" you know in your heart that something is morally wrong."

1,"Republicans: You can't force people to get a vaccine. It is their body, their choice.
Also republicans: You can ban a woman from getting an abortion because even though it is their body, it is not their choice.

If abortion is murder, then isn't allowing people to put others at risk of getting sick and dying because of their ignorance murder too?

Also, I have every confidence that most judges would consider any law that punishes a driver for taking someone somewhere without knowing if the person is committing a crime or not, to be unconstitutional, or at the very least has no legal ground to stand on."
1,"""Consider a scenario where you are a perfect bone marrow match for a child with severe aplastic anemia; no other person on Earth is a close enough match to save the child's life, and the child will certainly die without a bone marrow transplant from you.""

""If you decided that you did not want to donate your marrow to save the child, for whatever reason, the state cannot demand the use of any part of your body for something to which you do not consent. It doesn't matter if the procedure required to complete the donation is trivial, or if the rationale for refusing is flimsy and arbitrary, or if the child is a genius or a saint or anything else - the decision to donate must be voluntary to be constitutional.""

""This right is even extended to a person's body after they die; if they did not voluntarily commit to donate their organs while alive, their organs cannot be harvested after death, regardless of how useless those organs are to the deceased or how many lives they would save. That's the law.""

""Use of a woman's uterus to save a life is no different from use of her bone marrow to save a life - it must be offered voluntarily.""

""By all means, profess your belief that providing one's uterus to save the child is morally just, and refusing is morally wrong. That is a defensible philosophical position, regardless of who agrees and who disagrees. But legally, it must be the woman's choice to carry out the pregnancy.""

""She may choose to carry the baby to term. She may choose not to. Either decision could be made for all the right reasons, all the wrong reasons, or anything in between. But it must be her choice, and protecting that right of body autonomy means the law is on her side. Supporting that precedent is what being pro-choice means."""

1,"Daily reminder: Trump punked out over 6,000 service member and contractors (losers and fools to him) who died to support the democratically elected government of Afghanistan.


⁍ Trump surrendered AF to a terrorist organization without the permission of the  democratically  elected government.

⁍ He constantly capitulated while they only met 1/4 of their terms.

⁍ Trump transferred all of the military equipment before January 15 - Biden became president on January 20th

⁍ Trump forced the Afghans to spring 5,000 high value POWs who controlled 70% of the country with Al Qaeda

⁍ Trump and Steph Miller completely wrecked the (SIV) and trapped our allies. Americans should have left on their own. They put our service members in danger 

⁍ In 2020 Congress withheld funding for troop withdrawals without informing the public about Afghan army desertions, government stability, and police readiness. He broke the law and reduced troops to 2500

⁍ Biden had two choices: Disregard the trump surrender resulting in American hostages, beheadings, and service casualties or do what he did GET US OUT

⁍ Trump could have done the job if that was his goal. Instead he set the end date well (100 days) into the next administration to hamstring his successor, cause political damage, and reap power from chaos just like his brothers the Taliban do with suicide bombs"
