I let her stick her head out through the window while we were waiting.

She was looking back at a doggie with his head out the window of the car behind us.

I used to take my beagle out with me and anytime we went to a place with a window, he got all excited because he thought it was a McDonald’s."

Trump released 5,000"
1,Didn't Trump just release 5000 Taliban last year in some deal???
0,Totally predictable.
0,We told you so!
1,These are Ben Affleck's peaceful muslims that he talks about (He's a MORON!)
1,I have always said Obama is a Traitor to the U.S and its citizens! The damages that were done by his administration when he was president are beyond repair!
0,"Oh but they were good boys getting their lives changed around..,,"
1,ObamaHussein should be in Guantanamo for treason and conspiring with the enemy within.
0,Wtf
1,The American people need to know Obama is one of them
1,I believe it’s time to recognize the fact that he das plans to make the USA a Muslim country. Time to export him.
1,"Trump released their military leader and 5K Taliban, pulled out 10K troops and let them take over Afghanistan. You voted for a traitor, you own the consequences."
1,So Obama Derangement Syndrome is not a thing after he been gone for almost 6 years but still talked about like he just left? 😂😂😂

But I thank all those who placed the contact information of Dr, LUCKY on the internet because through that I have been able to contact Dr, LUCKY and today my relationship has been restored with love and more Respect than ever before.

1,Voting for Obama is coming back haunt us.
1,"The cabinet of the new “government” of Afghanistan is made up of mostly “UN terrorist watch list” people

Just great!!"
1,"We will likely be hit again by these savages, and the intelligence community believe it will be much worse than 9-11, likely with nuclear weapons."
1,The new Afghan interior minister is on the US terror list and has a $10 million bounty on his head but I'm sure we can negotiate with these people. The new Prime minister is on the UN Black List. What could possibly go wrong? prm
1,"Why did Afghan army collapse so quickly?

“The reason why it collapsed so easily is because Donald Trump informed everybody that there was drawl date was May 1st. When he was still in office he was quietly drawing down on the troop strength to the extent that his military advisers told him they didn't have enough military presence to protect Americans, the Afghan government, and the Afghan Army. It was Donald Trump who actually negotiated with the Taliban to release 5000 Taliban soldiers back into Afghanistan which totally undermined the government and so demoralized the Afghan military they gave up.”.."
0,No kidding
0,Before nko
1,Like many other things Obama / Biden did to damage this Country & others
1,"But Donnie's release of over 5000 taliban prisoners was ok.
🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄"
1,"The exchange is working out precisely as intended by Bath House Barry who supports the Islamic terrorists, always has."
1,"Well of course they are because Obama was helping them just like Creepy Joe is .
Obama gave them their leaders back and Joe gave them $800 billion in American weapons and their country back."
1,"Call the maga death squad at work here for the Taliban regime and Pompeo the deal maker.
Traitors"
1,Kevin Jackson you getting all pumped calling people snow flakes. Jacked up on the COOLAID I see 👀 But I hear you. 👉YOU R👈 doing some cult thing I need to be ready for on the Sept 18th. ⚠🚨⤴💪🇺🇸. Bless UR little Non Patriot heart.
1,"Yes, I agree trump failed America in July 2020, when he released 5,000 prisoners and one being their current leader. Why did he remove the troops? Oh that’s right trump was in bed with them. It’s all Don the con Trump’s fault…

“YOUR REMINDER that when four American soldiers were killed in Niger in 2017 because of Trump, Trumps response was to say nothing for Twelve days and then he called one of the solders widow a LIAR.”

Remember under Trumps watch 62 troops died in Afghanistan,Yet
you sat silent…
Now that Biden is President you care all of a sudden? You know Im right, it has nothing to do with the troops… but rather your Politics, so sad… #youmustbearepub

1,"Any Republican voting for someone other than Elder, is crazy."
1,"Newsome attacking Elder. Wow - Elder talking about poor management of the state. Fires, water, taxes. He’s right on"
1,If they keep Newsome they deserve whatever horrible fate befalls them. Newsome is unfit to govern. He's a waste of oxygen.
1,"Newsome and the Dems are RACISTS. Larry Elder is a black man of integrity. These venomous attacks must stop. Biden is a RACIST. Recently, Biden called a black man ""boy"". Biden, decades ago, fought against desegregation."

0,BUT GOD!!
1,"Newsom is a Loser, regardless if he wins. He's a control freak Loser, no better than Cuomo. He doesn't care about California, only himself, his status and his bank account. California's problems are out of control. A person who cares and loves his state doesn't allow ALL those terrible things to happen OR continue. People are leaving, business are leaving IN DROVES. Ask yourself why...Doesn't that tell you something, anything? It tells you Newsom is a worthless, good for nothing LOSER. Wake up California! Bring back your once great state to what it was, what it used to be. But I guarantee it won't be that under Newsom. You can take that to the bank, if you have any money left from high taxes, closed business and no tourism. Larry Elder is smart, cares about your state, the people, bringing your state back to what it was, what it used to be, and he will do that instead of giving you lip service like Newsom does."

1,"Why are people so obsessed with made up ""culture""? If a song mimicking General Lee and performed in blackface is your ""culture"" that's a problem. It's a stupid song. Replace it with something that ISN'T deeply invested in racism?

All these ""people"" crying about ""woke"" or ""This is Murica"" are every single reason America is failing rapidly. It's time to grow up people. You can't be a racist anymore. Sorry that you're offended by that?"

Til Gabriel blows his horn.

The lyrics are set to the tune of ""I've Been Working on the Railroad."" It is common practice that the last line, ""Til Gabriel blows his horn,"" is sung and played to a slightly slower tempo than the rest of the song. Students, faculty, staff, athletes, and alumni punctuate each beat of the last line with a small chopping motion of their right raised arm and ""Hook 'Em"" hand sign."
1,I'm offended that they commit the highest percentage of murders.
