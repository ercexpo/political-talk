This was a song made to poke fun at the then President of the college William Prather.
Was also for its student to remember, so they will know Texas I watching and wants them to do good things.

A little research would do some of these clowns some good.

If a student doesn't do their homework when applying to colleges by checking the school's history, fight song, and mascots, then they shouldn't complain and try to change the school's tradition.

1,"This should actually be viewed in a positive light, as its certainly verification that REAL oppression and racism is, by and large, rare and minimal in todays society.

If youve got nothing better to do with your time than protest song lyrics that arent in the least bit racist but that you choose to INTERPRET as racist.....then
yeah, you've come a loooong ways.

And you've definitely got a lot of spare time on your hands.

But whatever floats your boat, uber sensitive liberals.

Meanwhile, black conservatives are advancing in leaps and bounds and taking part in the wealth and prosperity that the United States offers.

The choice is yours, folks.

Be offended by every little ""microaggressio
n"" you can find in society.

Or GROW UP.....and move forward like a REAL ADULT.

I know which side I'd be choosing.
