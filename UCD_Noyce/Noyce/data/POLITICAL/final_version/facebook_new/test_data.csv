This was a song made to poke fun at the then President of the college William Prather.
Was also for its student to remember, so they will know Texas I watching and wants them to do good things.

yeah, you've come a loooong ways.

And you've definitely got a lot of spare time on your hands.

But whatever floats your boat, uber sensitive liberals.

Meanwhile, black conservatives are advancing in leaps and bounds and taking part in the wealth and prosperity that the United States offers.
