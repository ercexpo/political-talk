1,"Please tell me no one is surprised by this. This is the same Intel committee  at which  one witnesses (Flynn) took the  5th and other, Trump's own lawyer,  simply blew it off to which there have been no consequences. On what planet where law and order and democracy matter is that considered normal? Are the Republicans really interested in exposing corruption, or just worried their witness may have something compromising and so try to fish it out of them under the pretense of a hearing? My guess; they're on a fishing expedition to beat Mueller to the goods. This is how corrupt they have become: willing to undermine an investigation into a U.S. election sabotaged by a foreign power in order to maintain an installed puppet president."

Why did nobody that knew Trump was not under investigation tell it to the media?
Best kept secret in the government, FBI and DOJ.

And you wonder why Trump is asking for loyalty as everyone and their dog is trying to screw him over.

He showed his colors when he didn't stand up to Loretta Lynch.  If he had come out and said Trump was not under special investigation, would there had been need for a special prosecutor.

1,"UNDERSTANDING
HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA

Over and over and over again we hear the American citizen ask, ""Why is our country the only nation in the industrialized free world that doesn't guarantee free health coverage to its citizens?""

It's because we aren't listening to the ANSWER or maybe because we just find it too difficult if not impossible to believe.  

That answer is, ""Because we are a CAPITALIST society"".   That means we pay for whatever we get. The federal government can't offer us 100% guaranteed free health coverage because that would compete with free enterprise. It would never get past Capitalists. 

In hard, harsh language, as a health care provider in a Capitalistic society, my right to charge you to be able to stay alive at whatever is the cost I choose to impose is greater than your right to stay alive if you can‚Äôt afford it. What's more, that's the LAW; not in those words of course, but it is the LAW.

The bottom line is that in the richest country in the world ‚Äì wealthier still than the next 4 wealthiest countries combined -- we will wreck our savings, sell our homes, beg, borrow, steal -- or die -- in order to get the kind of health coverage we finally achieved under President Obama and which Trump is working overtime to take away from us. Those are the alternatives to health care now facing Americans under this administration because, once again, the insurance company has the right to charge you to be able to stay alive at whatever is the cost it chooses to impose, a right greater than your right to stay alive if you can‚Äôt afford it. 

The ""president"" agrees with this ‚Äúdeath panel‚Äù policy.
So too does the majority of the House. 
So too does the majority of the Senate.
So too will a Justice system imbalanced 5-4 and likely to be soon imbalanced 6-3 or even 7-2.

How in the world did we EVER get here?

I will tell you. On election day you decided to watch World Wide Wrestling instead, or to play some game on your computer. Maybe you just spent the day doing the couch potato. Maybe it looked like rain and you decided not to chance it.

In essence no one really did a thing to you. You committed suicide. Your contribution to changing the status quo was your decision to do nothing.

There are 8,760 hours in a year or 35,040 hours in the 4 years between elections. You need maybe 2 hours to go to town and file for an ID and perhaps another 5 to go vote on a heavier-than-usual election day turn out -- 7 hours total. Round that to 10 hours to allow for a flat tire or a stop at Juan In A Million's for an awesome taco and a beer on the way back from voting. Bottom line, 10 from 35,040 still leaves you 35,030 to do everything else.

I don't care if you hold down 3 jobs, have no car, live 3 miles from the closest bus stop or happen to be sick 95% of those 35,040 hours. You are still left well over 1,000 hours to get an ID and go vote, not to mention you have alternatives that will consume even less time -- such as mailing in your ballot. 

Consider this, that you may instead decide to find a full day to take to the streets later on and participate in a massive protest with 100s of thousands of other protesting citizens, but not a half day or less to go get an ID and vote?

That‚Äôs an excuse looking for a reason to be the poor, helpless victim or more dramatic still, to down a double Prestone Anti-Freeze Margarita. Do Juan In A Million's instead. It is much more satisfying, plus you can STILL take to the streets after the fact to protest -- and maybe even to CELEBRATE, not to mention you'll be healthier, happier and in much better financial condition because you voted."

Besides the insults levelled at me, some pointed out that, given Charlie's current situation, prolonging the inevitable is tantamount to child abuse.

I still find it deeply unsettling that a court can overrule parental rights and decide that a person, in this case a baby, should die."

1,Insanity. So sorry for the innocent people harmed.
1,"Remember that lovely little ""assessment"" report released to congress and the press breaking the ""proof"" of Russian interference? Barely a moment was spent describing the supposed proof, more time was spent on what is an ""assessment"" or ""judgment"", how they reach assessments or judgments, and how they rate these assessments and judgments.

But the majority of the report was actually dedicated to showing that RT was an arm of Russian government propaganda.  The report even went so far as to detail examples of what they call ""propaganda"" including:

RT covered Occupy Wall Street and came to the conclusion that Wall Street is greedy.  Who woulda known?!

RT covered fracking and said it was bad for the environment. Scandalous!

RT coverage questioned the integrity of U.S. elections because of the undue influence in big money in our political system. Hmmm...didn't we have a candidate who basically ran their campaign on this topic?  And drew tens of thousands to hear that message, filling stadium after stadium to overflowing? Oh yeah...I think his name was Bernie.

And most egregious of all, the straw that must have broken the back of the voters in the U.S. and affected the election, thus proving Russian meddling, RT actually had the audacity to give coverage to the third-party presidential candidate debates.  How could they?  How dastardly!

These and more were listed in that report as examples of Russian ""propaganda"".

Propaganda my ass. Seems to me like RT was committing actual acts of journalism.  

This is the insane nature of the push to try to prove in some fashion that ""Russia did it"" even though not ONE of our intelligence agencies have actually examined the DNC servers, multiple FBI requests for access having been denied by Debbie and the DNC.

Perhaps they can't hand over the servers because they don't want what is in them to become available as potential evidence in the ongoing class-action civil-suit against Debbie and the DNC for defrauding U.S. donors to a Democratic party that claimed it was running an equal platform for ALL Democratic presidential candidates when they had no intent of backing anyone but Hillary.

There would also surely be more evidence in there of the pervasive and egregious election fraud committed on behalf or at the behest of Hillary in the primaries.

As well there may be evidence of The Clinton Foundation involvement in essentially laundering donations for Hillary's use in the campaign. To my knowledge, there is STILL an ongoing investigation into the Clinton Foundation as well, noting the closure of one of their main means of fundraising, the Clinton Global Initiative.

Or maybe there simply isn't any evidence of Russia hacking, which would mean the DNC emails were leaked, and the question then turns to ""Who LEAKED the emails, and attention will swing right back on to Seth Rich and his ongoing murder investigation.

Regardless of whether there is proof of any Russian interference or not the fact remains that Debbie and the DNC refused access to those servers, and NO ONE, not Debbie, not the DNC, not John Podesta, not even Hillary, are asking that the servers be examined so the truth can be known.  Even IF there were actual proof of Russian interference there, which I seriously doubt, that they have not relinquished those servers makes it plain to see they are hiding something in those servers.  To not hand over the evidence to do what they so badly desire, which is to take down Trump and Russia simultaneously, it is obvious that they are hiding some thing, or things.

We must subpoena and examine those servers, not to look for evidence of Russian hacking or interference, but to look into the evidence of ANY improprieties or illicit activities on ANY party or party's part, from the beginning of the primaries to the end of the general election. 

And until that happens, until our intelligence agencies actually have their hands on those servers and whatever proof they hold, instead of relying on the ""assessment"" of a third-party cyber-security firm employed BY the DNC, and until they transparently release solid proof of such meddling, I am calling the ""Russia did it"" narrative complete bullshit, a political move aimed at demonizing Russia to sway American sentiment in favor of expanded perpetual war for the sake of profit, power over, and regime change's sake. And such ugly brinksmanship might even put us in a shooting war WITH Russian, a major nuclear power.  These are dangerous lies in a dangerous game they are playing, a game where OUR propaganda machine keeps telling us ""Russia, Russia, Russia."" They've got nothing on the skill of our propagandizers!"

In a motion filed by the state after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated portions of the ban on June 26, Attorney General Doug Chin argued that the Trump administration wrongly excluded grandparents and other relatives from the list of family members who can obtain visas to travel to the United States."

A handset / hand held device which can perform on the best speed possible when it comes to CPU 'n GPU (Samsung/Apple flagships), a battery that can make a dent like 5100 mah (Lenovo did it long back ""P2""), 120 Hz panel (Razor proved it!), Speakers (Razor again!), but with the things that haven't been figured out yet or maybe I'm not aware such as Palm/touch rejection,  temp control (Liquid metal is a start!), anti-sweat panel/back panel (Extremely specific for few users out there) and maybe even wireless display connectivity/speaker system for home use.

Even if it was designed to be one, it doesn't matter within the context of the universe itself.

1,"The House of Colonna hold the continual position of Prince Assistants to the Papal Throne at the Vatican. They claim to be the Julio-Claudian dynasty of ancient Rome and directly descend from Peter de Columna and the Counts of Tusculum. Cologne Germany was named Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium named for the Julio-Claudian family. The Colonna family use the column on their coat of arms which is a symbol for political power. The Colonna name derives from the Greek word kolona which means a column. The Columbus and Colombo names also derive from Columna and from Peter de Columna. Christopher Columbus was a relative of the Colonna family and he claimed America for Rome. Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa and was funded by the Doria banking family who are intermarried with the House of Colonna. America is named after Amerigo Vespucci an Italian explorer working for the House of Medici. Amerigo Vespucci created the term New World for the Americas. Novus Ordo Seclorum is Latin and means New Order of the Ages and is on the US dollar and US great seal. The Vatican City State is the only nation on the planet that uses Latin as an official language.

The Colonna's control the Colombo crime family and several Jewish mafia factions which also run Hollywood and Columbia Pictures for Black Nobility like the House of Colonna. They also have majority ownership over the Chicago Outfit. The House of Colonna control the Knights of Columbus which uses the Roman fasces symbol for its logo. There are many police officers and federal agents that are members of the Knights of Columbus. The Colonna family have influence over police and organized crime. The Five Families are covert business enterprises for the Italian Nobility and they use their mafia to blackmail politicians. Prince Prospero Colonna di Stigliano is the current head of the Stigliano branch and his wife Princess Frances Colonna. The Colonna family come from Alba Longa and established a branch in Salamanca Spain known as the Dukes of Alba which merged with the FitzJames family of England. Salamanca uses the column on its flag where the Dukes of Alba ruled. Diego Columbus marriedÂ Maraa de Toledo of the House of Alba. The Colonna family are also related to theÂ Coloma family of Spain which settled in Belgium as powerful counts and landowners.

Prince Guido Colonna di Paliano was a Commissioner of the European Union, Italian Vice Consul to New York City and a member of the Trilateral Commission. Jerry Colonna is a financier from New York City who helped to establish Silicon Valley. Jerry Colonna who is believed to be worth over 50 million started a small investment group called Flatiron Partners which was in the business of making billions for companies like JP Morgan Chase. Jerry Colonna is protected by organized crime which attack me whenever I mention him. Jerry Colonna appears to be used for handling their illegal transactions and for money laundering. The Colonna family came from Alba in Rome and Saint Albans was one of their agents who settled in Saint Albans name after him in England. The Roman Alban clan later created the Barons Romney that established themselves about 100 miles away from Saint Albans. The name Romney means Roman. The Colonna family ceremonially rule over Capitoline Hill which represents the political power of Rome's corporate empire.

The column symbolizes the political support that maintains their claim to governmental land ownership. Freemasonry uses two pillars or columns in their temples for the two Colonna princely lines of Stigliano and Paliano. Paliano comes from the Latin word Palus meaning a stake or support like a pillar. The Colonna family also intermarried with the Barberini papal nobility which use bees on their coat of arms. The Mormon Church was created by Freemasons from New York and Mormonism uses bees and beehives as a common symbol. Mitt Romney is a powerful Mormon and politician. Romney means Roman. Washington DC is Roman architecture and has the Roman fasces symbol all over US federal buildings and US seals. Fascism means a centralization of power. Capitol Hill is named after Capitoline Hill in Rome. Washington DC was called Rome in 1669. Members of the Colonna crime family include Prince Prospero Colonna di Stigliano, Prince Stefano Colonna di Stigliano, Prince Oddone Colonna, Prince Prospero Colonna di Paliano, Prince Marcantonio Colonna di Paliano, Prince Urbano Riario Sforza Barberini Colonna di Sciarra, Princess Frances Colonna di Stigliano, Jerry Colonna, and Stefano Colonna from the University of Milan who developed the Julia-Colonna Epoxidation process used in vaccines. Prince Prospero of Stigliano and Prince Marcantonio of Paliano are the heads of this Roman clan."

Also, I have a different interpretation. People want to sleep with rockstars and athletes, I don't hear very much about women flocking to tech billionaires or anything like that. Though I'm sure they could find someone that wants to be taken care of. If it was acceptable for men to do the same, more men would do it as well as more women become rich.

So why would I prefer lawyers to bullet-proof a bill ? Because of Legaleese. Politicians use their own lingo, but when one wants to circumvent a legal constraint, one gets a lawyer.
It looks a lot like Ro-Sham-Bo. Politician speak is often vague enough to bore loopholes in many texts. Legaleese is technical, precise, strives to eliminate double entendre and incertitudes ; Legaleese wins. My theoretical politician would hire the most vicious lawyers he/she could find to make his/her bill as unassailable, as unambiguous, as self sufficient, as rhetorically inert as possible.

1,"Your point is the US makes and sells weapons and that is the reality of the situation, which does provide a decent source of income for the nation. I don't even disagree with that, because it isn't like the US hasn't done that in the past and it will continue to do so into the future. Weapons exist, so someone has to make and sell them. How am I doing so far? Has your assumption paid off yet?

Before I go on I'll just remark that I always take TYT with a grain of salt, because frankly they're a little too overtly bias for the left and I've seen them make errors. I do consider myself a leftist, probably farther left than most. Regardless I want accurate information, not preaching to the choir. 

Now that we have that out of the way. You seem to be asserting that they are saying that making weapons is bad and they should not be sold to other countries because weapons are evil anti-flower loving things blah blah blah, and that is their argument against Trump in this case. But, nothing like that is ever said throughout the video, there's nothing about denying the reality that the US makes arms and sell those arms. The main point brought up is not being a moron by having the oversight of those sales done by a department that doesn't have the experience required to determine whether or not those weapons are going to someone who could be a potential threat out of a short-sighted desire to sell more of them.

And then the slightly more subjective point of how sad it is that Trump is going around trying to sell weapons to people like a door to door salesman who gets the door slammed in his face half the time because he's desperate for approval. But like I said, that's pretty subjective and not of any significant substance.  

So in summery, selling weapons is a reality that exists, and that's fine. Just be smart about it. And... you're ugly. Or something, since apparently personal appearance seems to somehow add value to an argument according to you."

You think you have a coherent framework, but all you have is your own opinions. The 2nd amendment is ambiguous enough that many differing federal laws can be enacted while still upholding the 2nd amendment.

Tell me, what arms should be regulated? If you start there, then I'll entertain a conversation.

If you want to pretend all arms should be legal, then why doesn't The Walton Family or George Soros have the right to purchase a nuclear weapon?

Perhaps you interpret the word ""bear"" to mean: able to carry on ones body.
But dirty bombs are able to be carried on ones own body. So should those be legal? Why or why not?

Notice, the 2nd amendment does not mention fire arms or guns, just arms."

Congrats, both the left and the right have reached a level playing field of extremism, violence and racism.

And in all the stupidity since Trump got elected, the left has ended up making a lot of conservative personalities end up lookign reasonable, and pushed liberals more to the right of the political spectrum.

The left destroyed their own base, forgot what being an actual LIBERAL meant, and turned into a bunch of ideological extremists, basing everything off identity politics, reversing the progress of race relations, and treating people SPECIFICALLY based on their race, and sex, and creating a progressive stack - the left turned into the racist equivalent of conservatives on the far right.

0,"A lot of cards can have that spiral effect in the right situation, it's in the nature of the game. What makes Thaurissan good is that his effect, while potentially very powerful, can also have very middling results -- if your optimal turn 7 play cost 7 mana to begin with, it doesn't matter that it now costs 6 because the mana is wasted. In most situations you get one improved turn at the cost of playing an overbudgeted body. He's excellent, but you don't just concede when your opponent plays him.

Dr Boom is different. He's good when you're ahead, he's good when you're behind, there's no good or safe way to deal with him, only slightly less bad ways. There's no thought behind playing him at all, nothing to set up, nothing to plan for... just power and boredom."

If riot really likes the risk of cleanse, then they should give a jinx passive speed boost that decays after successful cleanse of cc.

Cleanse is just so bad right now because it is incredibly hard to use, most cc is a second or two long, and you have to time cleanse perfectly to successfully use it, if you a tad too late, you are punished by only cleansing half of the cc duration, and too early means you wasted cleanse basically. 

Its also pretty cool how adcarries are running exhaust now too, it is especially useful on Lucian because he doesn't have any cc.

Those ""V Pull through"" sharpeners are alright to quickly put a decent edge on your knife, but it won't last and isn't as good as using a more manual sharpener where you control the pressure and angle.

Realistically you're not going to get a cost of living adjustment that completely covers the difference in cost from New Mexico to LA, especially if that would put you above what people who live in LA already make. You're definitely within your rights to ask and they should give you something, but I wouldn't get my hopes up of getting a 30%-40% pay bump just because you move to LA."
0,"most of the replies here have some positive and negative feedback but lets break it down even further for more details and comparison.

lets tackle the first problem BAKA:

the problem with him at the moment is that his ulti needs to be used near the enemy or else that extra range you get will be nothing and that is his down side. me as a baka player prefer to leave my jump skill as an escape or chase NOT as an engage because alot can happen in a team fight. so back to the ulti, the only good side to his ulti is that is ONLY gives that extra range (not even full Range compared to the ranged carries) with faster attack speed. dont get me started on these minions you devoure THEY ARE NOTHING! they are the most WEAKEST thing i have ever seen ingame at the moment! the normal lane creeps are much more powerfull than these devoured ones thier funtion at the moment is ONLY to bodyblock and that is like the most weakest thing an ulti in general really needs in smite. therefore, the possible and most balance change to baka's ulti is that it should buff these minions not give him cc immunity cuz that is really not needed.

second problem is the ranged carry:

Anhur compared to all other carries is just the most powerful between them all because as i stated in the first post his passive + the power from his slow pillar that increase the damage + his AA gives him quite a lot of physical damage output compared to the other Ranged carries. and regarding Anhur's jump, i know that bacchus jump does a knockback but bacchus is a tank. my first comparison was comparing Anhur's jump to other carries jumps like Hun Batz, Bastet, Baka, Fenrir (does stun but only AFTER full passive and that is BS imo) so you see how OP it is on a Carry ?

Third: VAMANA

i stand by my first post that vamana can be just as powerfull as herc at the moment using some tricks. one trick is that you build him as a bruiser however add to his kit sprint and creeping curse so you be able to keep hugging the enemy all the time and benefit from your ulti. this was demonstrated in last week's tourny between Snipe and Dig where Snipe's Vamana just kept bodyblocking and hugging Dig all the time and negetated ALOT of the damage from team Dig therefore this gave Snipe a huge advantage using vamana's big baby ulti as a bodyblock. all in all. Sprint and creeping curse + vamana ulti = vamana win.

I love Patterson, and love how he makes the team better rather than be a standalone star. But the Vikings really need a strong backfield threat to compliment him, or a highly refined player opposite him â€“ similar to Greg Jennings but younger."

0,"No, nothing would happen that you'd notice.

If it's a big enough plane with enough people on board, the pilot *might* start to notice the plane bank ever so slightly to the heavier side. He'd have the trim tabs fixed to right the course before anything happened, thinking that the wind had shifted.

What *would* cause problems is if everyone on the plane moved to the rear or to the front of the plane. The effect is dependent upon the size, speed, weight of the aircraft and weight of the passengers, but it's possible they could cause the airplane to climb or descend uncontrollably.

Source: I've spent WAY too much time dicking around with the payload layout in MS Flight Simulator.

edit: I forgot to mention. In some planes (large airliners) the pilot could pump fuel to the opposite end of the plane to counter the effect. But that's only possible if there's enough empty space in the tanks to do it. However, that process takes a long time, so if the aircraft is already uncontrollable he's probably not going to think to do it and execute it within enough time to save the plane. He's also going to wonder what the fuck is going on and start asking questions to the crew."

I'm currently cutting and doing around an hour of cardio, I started doing this out of nothing a week ago and am now up to 1 hour from 45 minutes.

Creatine

CLA
Green tea extract
Glutamine

Zinc

Iron, only on days I bleed. (I get a lot of nosebleeds.)


Ephedrine will be added, along with caffeine pills as soon as I get them. They're not so legal around here so I sent them to myself from when I was in Canada. Worst case scenario they'll never get here.

And I'm pretty sure I'm forgetting some stuff somewhere.

Is it too much? Is there something I should cut out or replace?

Besides that I would also really like the fastest way to increase my endurance.

Right now mine's on par with 2 of my friends, they both have played for the past 7 years and still keep going. My calves cramp up easier then theirs but once I get past that I can easily keep up or outdo them in the lung capacity department.

I'm thinking of joining their team as well, I wouldn't mind turning some of my ""raw"" slow squats into a more explosive kind of strength. They both squat 40kg or something, my max is at least 80kg above theirs.

tl;dr

Supplement stack seems a bit much, and expensive. What to cut out/add.

1,"Do you realize that by taking medicine you are just doing more drugs?

You would still be yourself on meds but you would be a happy you.  The thing is with stuff like that you become addicted.  Do you want to take a happy pill all of your life?  Fuck no you don't.  Meds just cover up what the problem, not fix it.  What you need to do, like you said, is to change your lifestyle if that is what you don't like.  Try to eat healthy and try to get over being skinny.  I am very tall and slender myself.  Most people don't care and the ones that do are not the kind of people that you sound like you would want to hang out with anyway.  

The whole 'not being able to protect' thing is not really silly because it is part of your instinct.  It sounds like it just comes down to the fact that you need to start working out.  Hire a personal trainer if you have money.  Go to a gym if you have less.  And if you have none like a lot of people, maybe try and find someone who will be your 'work out buddy' and work out with them.  It will motivate you both.  If you happen to be a poor loser with no friends like me, then challenge yourself.  I.e. Next time I get my face eaten off by a zombie on dead or alive 2, I have to do 10 push ups or something.  What ever floats your boat.

Also, maybe slow down on chiefin' it up.  I get really lethargic if I get high.  Tell em you are trying to find a job or just slow down.  People usually understand and don't ask twice about it other then accidentally passin' that shit when your in the circle, but that is just being courteous, in case you change your mind or something.

As for the whole womans thing.  You can't find love if you have none for yourself.  There is a whole host of reasons for this but suffice to say people pick up on that.  Also, love is rare.  Just start talkin to ladies and what not and they will warm up to you.  After that, if you poke em' you poke em' and that is all you can do.  

Summarized version of the a fore told ramble:  Get a work out buddy or maybe challenge your self (I can smoke one more bowl if I do 100 jumping jacks).  Don't confuse happiness with being high from meds or street drugs.  Smoke less pot.  Love + you = love + hot bitch across the street."

- The fight takes place in the Red Zone from Prototype 2.

- Alex cannot summon infected to fight for him.

- Devastators, consuming infected to regain health, Bio-Bombs and Pack leader are not taken into account until round 6.

- Alex can use Infected Vision to find Heller (I'm assuming that he can do that even if Heller hides among the Infected) and Heller can use his Hunting Pulse to find Mercer. This is useful if either fighter runs away at some point and the other has to give chase.

- In round 6, both combatants can switch powers on the fly and are not limited by selecting the power in-game.

Alright let's get this party started.

- **Round 1: Fists only**

In terms of bare fists, Heller only had basic punching, a heavy kick and an air kick. Mercer on the other hand has a much more diverse arsenal. He has basic punches and basic kicks that he can mix up, he can charge all of these for more damage, he has terrific AoE attacks with Knuckle Shockwave and his Ground Pound, his air kick goes much further than Heller's and does more damage... Besides that he also has Palm Slam as a good attack to use from a distance where Heller won't be able to hit Alex with his fist attacks. Mercer also has air combos and a very powerful charged punch on the third hit that will send Heller flying. Finally, Mercer has the cannonball (which hits like an absolute truck) and the Divebomb. Although Heller also has that attack, Mercer's version is far more powerful if used from high up. Overall, Mercer's arsenal with fists is far more versatile and he has something for every situation. Heller has very few attacks to work with and no good way to get Alex out of his face (such as the Knuckle Shockwave). I'd have to say **Alex 9/10** in this scenario, although I can't give a good scenario where Heller will be able to outsmart Mercer enough for him to take the remaining 1/10. 

- **Round 2: Claws only** 

Mercer's basic claw attacks do little damage. Against Hunters, its damage is sub-par, not doing *that* much more than bare fists can do. Mercer's most important tool here are th Groundspiked. This will track Heller from the ground and do pretty good damage to him, although it's telegraphed if he charged it. Still, Mercer can do uncharged ground spikes as a reasonable way to get damage in on Heller, if Heller doesn't dodge it however, because the recovery on Groundspikes is quite long.

Heller's claws on the other hand are a lot better. His Claws do noticably more damage than Alex's, if Brawlers and Hunters are compared, and claw pounce is a lot more practical than Groundspikes are. The spikes are Alex's answer to armored vehicles and Hunters, with the regular slices being better for dealing with regular soldiers and infected. Heller's Claw Pounce, while not being very good vs tanks, has incredible range to it, especially when fully upgraded. If Mercer ever misses a Groundspike attack and is dealing with the recoveryvon it, Heller could get a free Pounce in for good damage. The key here is that because Alex's basic claw attacks are quite weak, he *will* have to rely on Groundspikes for most of the fight, which Heller can punish him for.

I'd say this goes to **Heller 8/10**. Groundspikes aren't that practical versus a fast-moving Prototype and it's the only thing he'll get good damage from. Heller has much better Claw powers and will be able to easily give chase to Mercer if he decides to run away from Heller. The 2/10 I see Mercer taking is only when he manages to keep himself away from Heller without getting tagged by the Pounce too often and if he manages to land a good number of Groundspikes without getting Pounced for it. The spikes have pretty good vertical range, so it's not like it's an entirely free dodge for Heller. Still, Heller wins by quite a lot here.

- **Round 3: Whipfist only**

I haven't used the Whipfist in Prototype 2 too much yet, because it's a pretty late-game power. As such I may be missing some details on Heller's version here. I'd say the two Prototypes have a very similar Whipfist though. Both have immense range with their heavy attack, so hit-and-run tactics are not an option. Both have normal attacks also with very good range, so I imagine that they will likely never stay in each others' face as to have a better chance of dodging the other's Whipfist.

Because the two powers are so similar, I think it largely comes down to what else they're capable of. In this specific round, I'd say their respective personalities play a big part. Alex is relatively calm when fighting and slightly (emphasis on slightly) more tactical than Heller is. Heller is more hot-headed, fueled by anger. I think Alex will likely run away from Heller to get more of an advantage when it comes to where they're fighting as opposed to Heller. Heller will never run away because of his personality and will mercilessly give chase to Mercer. This does mean that because Heller is so focused on the chase, he may forget if Mercer is trying to bait him into something. For instance, Mercer tries running away and Heller tries to grab him with his Whipfist. Right before it hits him, Mercer throws something in front of Heller's Whip and proceeds to do his own Whipfist heavy attack, which may tag Heller because he's trying to get rid of the barrel or whatever Mercer threw at him.

All in all, I'd say **Alex Mercer 6/10**. The two have a very similar Whipfist, so it comes down to whether Alex outsmarting Heller will work out. Heller is not an idiot though and will likely not fall for the same trick twice. I'd say because of Heller's hot-headedness, Mercer has a slight advantage in this round.

- **Round 4: Hulk Hands only**

Let's just get out of the way that Heller has a better light attack, heavy attack and air heavy attack. Heller's Hammerfist do more damage, his heavy attack is a million times better than Alex's. Heller's heavy summons a large wave of groundspikes that does good damage, but most noticably it has a lot of horizontal and vertical range to it. It has slow-ish recovery however, so if Alex does manage to dodge it (because Heller's groundspikes don't track, jumping sideways is a good way to dodge it), he can go in for the punish. Heller's air heavy is also extremely good. It gives Heller great AoE spikes that do good damage to Mercer. While Mercer should be able to jump out of the way fairly easily, if he gets tagged by it (which is very possible considering its massive range) he'll definitely feel it.

However, besides the fact that Mercer's air elbow slam does more damage than Heller's, Alex has a trick up his sleeve: Hammertoss. After a decently long charge time, Alex charges a fuck ton of speed up in his body and launches himself into the air with the Hammerfist at the front. While I'm going to ignore the ridiculous tracking it has in-game, I'm still going to assume that Alex has decent control over where he's going with it (sorta like gliding). This attack does a truck load of damage, I'm talking a TRUCK load of damage. The charging in itself also gives Mercer a decent speed, which may help him in being able to dodge Heller if he intends to punish the charge of the Toss. The punish can happen with Heller's Grondspikes well enough because of its large range, being able to hit Alex before he gets close to Heller.

So basically, if Alex can hit Heller with like 2 Hammertosses, Alex will have a major advantage. Whether he can do that or not is the question. If Heller can jump very high very quickly once he sees the Toss coming, he'll be able to avoid it, but he likely won't be able to punish it. I'd say **James Heller 6/10** here. Heller's Hammerfist arsenal is overall more solid, but Hammertoss is a really really good ability. Not 5/10 because Alex is quite reliant on Hammertoss and once Heller figures out how to deal with it, he'll have an edge."
0,"I'm gonna urge some caution here. Testing shuffling methods to try to achieve a certain kind of ""spread"" is deck-stacking. You're allowed to reorganize cards in your waiting room at will (as long as new cards hitting the waiting room are initially placed on top, and the cards remain as one stack), but when refreshing, you have to shuffle to the point that the original order of cards from the WR is irrelevant.

If you organize cards a specific way in your WR, your opponent has every right to expect an extremely thorough shuffle from you afterward, so that no pattern of cards can be expected to exist in your deck. (Also, waiting until refresh time to reorganize the WR is unacceptable since you have to refresh immediately)

1,"I hear ya, I have been able to walk to school for the past 5 years and it has been the greatest convenience of my life by far. 

The people who live outside the city and drive in have larger suburban houses (usually) and they have cars. That's a benefit in itself. Why on top of that should their parking spaces be cheap or free if the real cost of providing those spots (economically and environmentally) is actually quite high? We wouldn't give those same people free bus passes. The buses and stations cost money to operate. Parking spaces are the 'stations' or 'terminals' of auto travel in a sense."
0,"I got mine at a well-known electronics market in Seoul. They sell new and second hand and if you bring a Korean or can speak fluently (I can't, I brought my friend), you can haggle a pretty good deal. I got the body, 18-55mm kit lens, UV filter, HD SD card, bag, etc for less than $850 (USD). There are markets like that in a lot of countries, but I don't know any other specific places. Akihabara in Tokyo is another well known electronics mecca, but I don't know what kinds of prices you can get there. I think it should be similar to where I got mine.

You probably won't stand out as much as you think with your camera, even a big one, but I know what you're saying. A good travel tip that I've come across in several different places is to put some black tape across any brand logos or names on whatever equipment you end up getting and to get another neckstrap for your camera. The ones that come in kits have brand names and models stamped all over them. 

If you want a warranty and all of the bells and whistles that come from buying a piece new/in your country of residence, just buy it in Australia.  However, I'd recommend buying something used, if you can and you can find somewhere reputable. That'll minimize risk on your investment if (God-forbid) something happens on your travels, and you might find it more approachable to use. Another reason I went for mirrorless -- it's not as huge or has many dials and stuff as a DSLR. They have all the same functions etc, but I think the user experience is a little more friendly to a beginner. To use my SO as an example again, he went for a 60D because it's a highly regarded model, but he didn't know much about how to use one. He left it in his case for the first four months after buying it because it seemed too complicated. :P

I'd also recommend going to a store to see different options. You might do a bunch of research online and think you've found the one you want, but when you go to hold it, the balance is all off or the view finder isn't where you want etc. It's much easier to see them in person. I had my heart set on the Olympus OMDE5, but when I got to the store and handled a NEX, my opinion immediately changed. That's a potential drawback if you're trying to find bargains at used markets in Asia. They might not have all the models you're interested in comparing etc. 

This is a pretty good online store for cameras: http://www.bhphotovideo.com/
Sometimes they have really good sales and they have interesting bundles.

And this is a photography website that has a bunch of different articles about photography and gear. I really like their articles because they're short and direct. I've learned a lot from them. They also have a forum where you could probably get some more answers from.

Because he wasn't *physically* doing anything wrong, management had to stress that he was always about one fuck up away from getting fired.

Asurion has also made me as a CSR rep, and the customer go to war with them. The customer had an Ipad Air, it got stolen. He had insurance which was added on the day of purchase, he called to make a claim, Asurion said ""We cannot verify any usage, therefore we will not honor the claim"". Fair enough...

I check the bill, and I see his Tablet line on the bill has data usage. I check the MDN/Equipment history to make sure no other devices were assigned to that number, so that data usage recorded on the bill was accurate, and was from the Ipad Air. 

I had to call Asurion with the customer on the line, and escalate to 3 different Asurion reps, and explain to them as a person from Verizon's side, our information checks out, and everything is fine. There should be NO issue to make this claim, infact if you would like I can reprint this bill validating the usage, and have the customer fax/send/email it to you guys if necessary.

**Backstory**

I quit University at 21 just before I had finished to go and work abroad (8 hours plane journey from my home country). I have been working abroad now for almost 2 years - and I really enjoy my job - the sense of freedom it brought with it (own apartment/new city) is refreshing as well.

I am still in a relationship with a girl I met at University and I have strong feelings for her (she's the first girl i've said ""I love you"" to). I have seen her twice since I left University for my job.

When I got over here, the freedom I had made me want to explore and I was pretty lonely, only being friends with people at work. So I met someone from an online dating site, initially just for friends, but after 6 months we started hooking up and we have been having sex ever since. I have never told this other girl about my girlfriend.


**My Issues**

I am so afraid of hurting people and of being alone that I continue to live this ""double"" life and it's slowly hurting me - i've had panic attacks for no reason - and I don't have anyone else to blame but myself.

I can't ever let my girlfriend come over here as I am sure she'd find out about this other girl some way.

I don't know what I should do - and I am constantly trying to forget it all, but its starting to hurt me as a person (I am lying more and more).

What should I do?

Even if he's going with the whole downgrade for now idea the lowest card he should downgrade to is probably a 390.

The upside

1)Potentially better return once next lineup is out and when DX12 is more prevalent and 390 maintain its value better.

The downside

1)Transaction costs: the cost of selling/shipping a 980 Ti, the cost of buying a 390 now and the future cost of selling said 390 to upgrade again. You are going to lose on the margin on 2 cards as well as paying shipping for them.

2)Huge current performance loss.

So while I see where you are coming from and have considered the exact same thing. I don't think at the end of the day its worth it unless potential $$ is more important than current enjoyment.

0,"I'm actually a big fan of the Shadowbeam Staff. The bonding us really great for CC and it doesn't cost much mana. My order would be:


1. Shadowbeam Staff - Great for killing mobs, can be used as main weapon, awesome animation. Pretty bad against bosses.


2. Inferno Fork - Huge damage against stationary mobs, great AOE but travels slowly making it impractical for constant use.


3. Spectre Staff - High base damage and homes, but it's just a single target DPS weapon. Most boring of the 3 IMO.


Leaf blower isn't on the list since it's more of a boss-killing weapon than anything. Works great with Spectre heals so it's good for boss fights, but honestly the Laser Machinegun is a direct upgrade so I wouldn't really bother with it unless you get it early."

Anyway, GG healer throws a big heal my way then drops as well and I'm left standing alone against this thing on maybe around 25-30% health - and I killed it. Took me ages and every cooldown (even a pot and I NEVER remember them in combat) with the healer cheering me on the whole time.

0,"Finally dumping a clingy-as-hell, fucked-up-as-hell ex-girlfriend.

She was autistic. She was also dealing with depression issues, a shitty family, couldn't seem to get along with anyone else for whatever reason, and (to hear her story) a really, REALLY SHITTY high school.

But she also blamed her problems - poor/failing grades, not getting up in the mornings, homework, everything - on everyone and everything but herself. And all she ever did about it was cry. Cry, and cling to me even more. Now, I'm okay with crying every now and again. But I can't stand it 24/7. I can't deal with that. I tried to support her, tried to help her... but all she did was cry and cling and play the blame game more and more. I'm not even sure if she ever told me the truth much, if at all. Like I never heard the other side of the story; namely, that maybe she just wasn't trying or applying herself.

And yet, I couldn't bring myself to get rid of her because 1) She was my first-ever real girlfriend (I'd NEVER had that kind of interest before in my life!) at the age of 18 and 2) She was fucked-up in a lot of ways, but she had nice tits and she did share my interests in video games and nerdy stuff like that. And most importantly... I was way, WAY too wishy-washy on decisions like these. I kept hanging on, letting her hang on, dragging me down with her.

And then, it finally got so bad that she dropped out of college. And FINALLY, I grew a pair and admitted that this just wasn't working. Was it wrong of me to detach myself as the only real lifeline this depressive basket case had? Maybe... but I had to take care of myself, and she sure as hell wasn't making things easy. And it was clear that nothing I did worked with her. So I let her go, and eventually got her out of my life entirely.

I wonder about her sometimes - whether she actually grew the fuck up and turned it around, or finally snapped and hung herself. If the former, great, and I'm glad she did. If the latter, well... I'm no angel. If you're looking to me as your savior, you'd damn well better look somewhere else.

Ironically, her being a basket case may have saved me on another matter at that time: I thought math teaching would be a good idea, but it really wasn't. I was too shy and nervous and the kids knew it. I couldn't handle teaching. Yet I kept playing make-believe... until finally, I got a shitty review from a teacher on my fieldwork, complaining that I always came in tired (due to my clingy ex). I finally admitted that I'd been thinking that maybe teaching wasn't right for me. My professors then and there encouraged me to consider other options. I did... and never looked back. And I am SO GLAD I didn't go into teaching.

Now I always think that one of the most important things in life is to know what you want. If you don't, you act like an idiot like I did."

I just got out of a couple month relationship with this girl, and sex was never brought up. It was more of mutual conversation and (potentially) building a life together-IE if she wanted marriage, family, etc. 

I know that in some states, that having sex under 18 is okay, but would having a relationship like this be acceptable to society and in the law? I'd like to know for future reference. I ended it because I thought the age would be a barrier, and that I did not want to get myself into any bad situation should things get heated."

0,"This seems like a logical explanation, thank you. However, another question arises then: ""promoting"" something about a lifestyle (like a certain type of figure) isn't the sole purpose of these pictures; quite often, it's also a selling point (or just an ""eye candy"", you know). I'm not sure how airbrushing could be bad from this angle. When it comes to judging a picture purely by how neat it looks (instead of what message it carries), a touched up picture that hides this or that flaw is better, isn't it?

And since there's this type of benefit for at least some of such pictures (that is, the ones that aren't actually about ""ladies, this is how you should look""), why should it be forbidden / frowned upon? A rather random example, but I'm sure that 95% of Internet users in the US don't know what's a VPN. The other 5% might use it for ""good"" purposes and for ""evil"" purposes. Would it make sense to ban VPN usage nationwide? Would it make sense to ban anything that *does* have a ""good"" side of how you can use it (and no one forces you to use it at all)? Back on topic, would it make sense to ban unrealistically skinny images if they have at least one ""valid"" usage (eye candy for someone) and no one is forcing them down people's throats as the only standard of beauty?

After all, there's also a question of personal preference. Some people may like unrealistically thin girls, some might even like anime-drawn girls... Just because someone finds this specific type of figure extremely attractive, doesn't mean that they will demand and judge ""realistic"" girls based on their ideals. Almost everyone knows how to separate fantasy from reality."

0,"It's still pretty soon to talk about Lapis but let's compare their skills from an AoE, stun, base dmg and cd perspective for ToA: 
 
1. Lapis has 1 less cd on 3rd and 2nd skill. His second skill AoE disturbs hp recovery but it's not 100% and it's random, while tyron it's full AoE. For ToA floor where I need HP disturb I would rather use briand. 
2. When talking about despair procs and stuns I think tyron might be better (unless you have crazy speed on lapis), since both of his AoE full area and his third skill is a 100% freeze (before resistnce), from my experience, using tyron+baretta+vero is almost 2-3 or even 4 stunned turns on 3-4 man or full enemie team.
3. Better multipliers on lapis but overall more utility on tyron. If you want a DD you might better consider sigmarus (who even has AoE and can freeze in att build) or another one, lapis att base is pretty low. 
4. Tyron leader skill is awesome everywhere, and in general, you can still farm with tyron with his despair/focus build. Yes, 24% att boost from lapis is ok, but not that much when you need healers/veromos/baretta/rezzers on high floors of ToA.

I feel lapis cries for despair set, but he don't have as much utility as tyron may give you. But again, I'm only theoryzing, too soon to judge a 1 day born mons.

So cars obviously have a certain amount of icons that can be in the ""Trunk"" for storage. I was thinking, cars could have a medium initial amount of max storage. The more open seats in the car, the more the ""Trunk"" can hold. Say you have all your storage taken up and another person tries to get in. It could give them the message ""There isn't enough space in this car."" Or something like that. In the future, trucks could possibly have more initial storage, then offroaders, then police cars.
Nerfs police cars, gives more reason to trucks (because as of now people can shoot from any car, so the truck is just a slower car with less seats)
This also helps solo players and gives groups a disadvantage. I'm all for it, despite the fact that I play with a group of 7 others.

On top of that I can totally see where Raptors fans are coming from when they want to tank. This year is LOADED with potential franchise playing players, especially in the top 5. We can keep playing decent and make the first round and lose (on top of not developing guys) but what is the point of that? We've been always stuck in this middle road for the whole franchise history (outside of 1 year) where we're either late lottery or going to the first round and losing. I think there need to be a change and I'm glad that Ujiri pointed out that he understands our history and will make sure we will not get stuck in the middle again. I trust him so I'll wait and see what he does to get us past the first round or help us tank/get high lotto pick.

1,"Because you can't justify the thought that ""the vast majority of them are like that"". That's the basic problem.

All you can do is note, as I have on my travels, that pretty much every time a feminist says s/he's not like that, it turns out they bloody well are. But even then, that's still just my subjective experience, and is prone to confirmation bias, selection bias, etc.

I would say: simply stick to making clear that it is your _opinion_, based on your subjective experience. Thus, the relevant claim is not ""The vast majority of feminists are X"", but ""Over my life, I've found that, in spite of their official protestations to the contrary, feminists do tend to end up being X."" It might not seem like a big difference, but it actually is. Above all, it signals that you're quite prepared to be proven wrong about it, and I think retaining an open mind is always important. "

Online Insertion and Removal 

Online insertion and removal (OIR) is a feature that allows you to replace CF memory cards without turning off the router and without affecting the operation of other interfaces. OIR of CF memory cards provides uninterrupted operation to network users, maintains routing information, and ensures session preservation.
 

The external CF memory card should not be removed if the flash memory busy ""CF"" LED on the router is ON, because this indicates that the software is accessing the CF memory card. Removing the CF memory card may disrupt the network, because some software features use the CF memory card to store tables and other important data. "

Sorry to say it, but I think this is one of those things where it's double standard.

Still it's a case by case basis...calling things 'gay' because you dislike them is not a joke, and obviously not okay."

0,"I think most of you are thinking about both wrong. 

Google Ads and Bing Ads (you should be using both) - Use this to build your traffic up, convert tire kickers to potential leads (offer them something for their email address) and use it to see what people are actually doing on your website (heatmaps - google analytics). Monitor what pages are doing best and optimize those pages to help decrease bounce rate and increase website engagement

SEO - AT THE SAME TIME YOU ARE DOING ADS, DO SEO AS WELL. 
See who is ranking for your keywords. Look at their backlink profile. Whereever they are, you should try to be. Did they do a guest post? Find out if it has a comment section and make an educated blog comment with a link to your website. 

Depending on what you're selling, you'll probably see a lot of citations, directory submissions, blog posts, etc. Try to copy exactly what they do. They are on the first page for a reason. 

After that, get your content strategy together. Post to your blog as much as you can, and create lists that will help with your SEO. See who has the ""biggest list"" and make yours bigger and better. Then check whereever that ""biggest list"" has links from, and reach out to those who mention that ""biggest list"". You are now the biggest list on the block. If they're smart, they'll link to your article as well. Make it better as far as visually appealing, better content, bigger list. 

After that, you'll want to get some link building going from high authority blogs. Use Page Authority / Domain Name Authority / Moz Ranking / Trust Flow as key indicators of what you want. There are several people selling this type of blogs. Don't be fooled of what you've heard from other people - this still works. 

Finally, try to get on blogs/websites that are CLOSELY RELATED TO YOUR NICHE. Getting links from generic blogs, etc. won't help you as much as a proper niche website/blog will do. Even blog comments still work! Look for low outbound links if you're going to do blog comments. 

Here's why you need to do both SEO and Ads at the same time: 

- Ads bring you guaranteed traffic while you're building SEO. While you are paying for traffic, it will give you key analytics and traffic to help you make your website better. Not making sales? This should tell you something. Start split testing while you're running the ads. Make sure you are doing your ads correct. You should be doing exact match or phrase and not broad. 

- While your ads are running, build up your SEO. Try to do it nice and steady, and once you hit the front page for key terms that you want, you can start taking your ad budget down a little at a time. Traffic you get from SEO doesn't cost you anything once you're there (only maintaining the rankings). 

View Ads as a 100 YD Dash, View SEO as a 50 mile marathon. 

Hope this helps.

0,"Post pics please! We can probably match the piece to the engine diagram if it is in fact a piece from your engine.

I'm drawing a blank as to what engine part that could be. The thing about engines is that every piece in it is needed, so in theory if there was a piece that came lose, your bike's engine would be in bad shape, or something wouldn't be working correctly. 

I'm taking a guess here, but it could be something that was accidentally left in the engine the last time the case was open, or maybe it's been in there since the day it was built in the factory. 

I've never taken apart a KTM, so I'm not too familiar with the individual pieces that make up the engine, so take my guess with a grain of salt.

Here are a few of my favorite tracks that I would ideally like to get close to.

0,"Hi guys, I've never posted here but it's kind of an emergency. I'm currently across the country on a community service trip. The women who we are helping has many doors where the doorknob does not work. Supposedly this closet has a replacement to the broken heater. It is FREEZING over here. I am very new to fixing stuff up but I'd love if I could fix this. I bought a replacement doorknob except the lock is in the door and I cannot undo it/take it out. 

I just need to be able to remove the doorknob/doorknob stuff 

Thank you so much!

1,"In general traditional rabbinic Judaism encourages a horizontal society, the more educated the masses are in Torah the better off we all are. Indeed Hazal authorized an official Aramaic targum (translation) and deemed it a weekly obligation to review alongside of a double reading of the weekly portion. Indeed in a case of lifeboat ethics, a mamzer who transformed himself into a Talmid Hakham takes priority over that of a Kohen! Traditional rabbinic Judaism does not generally see a proper Torah education as threatening. Quite the contrary it sees it as a strength and indeed personal obligation. 

That said, I don't know if there was any rabbinic response to Luther's translation however a better testcase would be Mendelssohn's translation. There was indeed some rabbinic opposition to it on the grounds that a) it was written in a very technical German rather than in a style more accessible to the masses and b) it could become too much of a crutch and may prevent people from pursuing a proper understanding of the text in the native Hebrew. As you can see in both reasons for opposition the concern was not that the Jewish masses will become too educated but to the contrary that they will not be sufficiently educated."

I've watched a good amount of episodes of Steven Universe and I just can't get into it. The characters are just so annoying and uninteresting to me. When people say they don't like Adventure Time because they build up stories just to have things go back the way they were, I think of Steven Universe. Very little has actually changed. Like Adventure Time, they foreshadow major events in little ways in multiple episodes. I don't see a difference between the two

I would not say that Season 7 has Adventure Time on a ""cliche and unoriginal"" path at all. People just want a pay-off from seasons worth of plots and I get that. But it makes the wait that much better. There are still a number of plots to explore: Maja and the elephant, the backstory to the Mushroom War, Ice King and the crown, Betty, The Lich/Sweet P, the impending future apocalypse, Prismo seems to be getting more involved, the possible threat of GOLB, Jake's mom/dad thing, Finn's mom, how PB built and sustained her kingdom, Finn's origins, Susan Strong, Gunter/Orgalorg.

http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/244qdy/best_friends_girlfriend_told_me_hes_gay/
http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/28ylwm/setting_boundaries_with_confused_straight_best/

Its slightly confusing, as there are some discrepancies, but if you Noirsky, are my ""gay best friend"" then I know you are also smart enough to slightly twist reality. So because of that, I will try to make a response as if you are, and if you are not it will be a bit of self help for me.

I came to this reddit because I needed some advice on how to deal with my gay best friend, who seems to be holding back. So how it came to this point: 6 years ago I met him at a university woodworking club, I was intrigued by him and his ambience, he has an amazing natural dominance over other people, he was cool, hip and he was guy I could learn from. I susspected he was gay, but it took a year or what to confirm it, never noticed it on him, and just considerd him as a friend. 

5 Years ago I had a relationship that ended with a bang (she cheated), I was at the point of going emotional MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction), and then he intervened, I'm very thankfull that he did as I had some recovering to do, this is when he became a rolemodel in my life, this is also the first time I explored ""gayness"" as an option through some chatroulette. But I ened up in a long term relationship quite quickly, not a single bad word about our ""bisexual"" girlfriend"", but when she moved in with me I ended up in a bromance with him (although I didn't even realize it was a bromance at this point). During parties with a very open atmosphere, I started teasing/playing with males with an equal aproach as I would tease females, because hey hippy-culture-equality that is fair playground. This slowly developped and over the last year I developped the mindset that I wanted to pursue a gay experience. I had no clue how to set this up, arrange this, or even go about making this a thing. I felt reluctant to simply ""use/ask"" my gay best friend, his friendship was way to valuable for me, it always feels like an ""everything is acceptable"" ""everything is good"" atmosphere, though we did slowly explore this during booze induced parties and there was some ""accidental"" (read intentional) groping from my end involved, though he never returned the favor. 

But 2 months ago, things changed, call it an alignment of the stars or the universe folding in on itself or a wrestling match, but I felt a moment so intimate, so in love with my best friend, it was so incredably beautifull, and I still feel it all the time since then, and especially after we've been together for an evening. The days after I ""felt straight guy turned gay"" I gained a perspective I've never had before, a light to shine onto all my past memories. In all the male friends that I had I could see this energy of ""male love"". Or all the dressingroom interactions I've had, or the sheer amount of bromances/special friends. For me it felt like an unlock of insight. 

But this type of love seems to diminish if talked about, because when you start talking you start to make demands if only implicitly, but for the both of us demands are like the root of all evil, we cherish our freedom and the lack of people telling us what we can not do. This is in our normal life,  When we are together I see something in his eyes, and I got the idea that he might be secretly in love with me all this time. I tried to reach out to him about this, but he bounced me a few times, and I'm unsure why this is, is he unsure of me because of my undefined/closeted sexuality, does he want to preserve our friendship, is he afraid of his own feelings. Is he safegaurding his private space that he always tells me he does with other gays, is he segregating ""playtime/booze""-roles from the rest of our lives. Am I not his type.  

I used to be sure of my sexuality as straight and through my openmindedness fully accepting people as being gay (also within my family and upbringing), through this openmindedness I also accepted myself doing gay things. But with females arousal and sexual atraction/fantasies comes fast, with males it requires a higher visual attraction and set and setting. From this I have to conclude I'm at least bisexual, though I see sexuality much more as a liquid. On an emotional/spiritual level females have never been able to connect to me in a way that was constructive, whereas my best friend has.

Typing this out, made me all soft and mushy weepy feelings again, because I do genuinely have feelings for him, I might be in the blue on my ""true"" sexuality, I'd just wish we'd hug and cuddle more."

I guess other companies may have a similar HR process.  However - for most companies in the software industry it seems like much less of an issue.

>And as every Marx and Lenin have asserted and proved, its an unfortunate necessity to promote development in a world dominated by capital

They never did anything of the sort, Marx never really got into the details of a socialist economy as it was not a thing of his time and Lenin never claimed that state capitalism is the way to go. At most, he identified it as one production mode present in Russia and claimed it was preferable to others, like subsistence farming (for obvious reasons).

1,"If everyone was class conscious we would have no need of starting movements anymore. There’s a decades-old, extremely funded hegemony designed exclusively to create “useful idiots” for the capitalists — a “machine” that makes them believe them to be bourgeois instead of proletarian. 

But even if you somehow forced these people to sit down and study basic economic and sociological concepts, some would still hold to their beliefs and prejudices. They are beyond any reasoning and you can’t reasonably expect to convert every single imperialist, racist, chauvinist or sexist to socialism. 

That’s not to say you shouldn’t seek to spread socialist ideas and class awareness, but keep in mind the stubbornness you’re bound to face. Many workers in the first world have been systematically indoctrinated with the capitalist dogma, and healing that brainwashing is never something easy — sometimes, it’s impossible."

They had the Minister for Health, who made major changes. She said they wanted Ireland to be 'closer to Boston than Berlin'.

I do think it's better that the US was dragged in though as it brought a quicker end to Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan who were committing genocide, but they only entered after being attacked and against Germany it was the Soviets doing the heavy lifting by far. This is however the only US war I would have fought in if I was american and lived then. (But again, not a war the US entered for the right reasons or with the right intentions)

I could point out a ton of critiques for the neocon arguments about WW2 too. But like, you seem to agree it was a good war, even if it had bad intentions.

>TL;DR A lot of these are responses to issues the US helped create, or the US entered with the wrong intentions. You may make a case that US intervention is in some cases preferable to x or y dictator, but I would say that leaves us looking in the wrong direction. The US will never overthrow a dictator for humanitarian reasons, only self interest, and after doing so will always attempt to solidify their influence on the people they ""liberated"".

Yeah I don't have a disagreement here. My take was never ""Sometimes the USA is good and we should support them!"" but more like ""sometimes US foreign policy leads to good things, but that still isn't a justification for imperialism""

Reading over it, this thread doesn't show a meltdown or screeching, but it's probably because this isn't really a surprise to anyone.

That said, there's very compelling evidence that, to some people, this was very premeditated. Look at some of the things these people were wearing: t-shirts mentioning civil war, preparation with zip ties and maps of the building-- it's clear that there were some people who knew this would happen.

So to me, this is just confirmation that the FBI and the government don't really have a way to police anonymous and decentralized forums that breed violence, since it's damn near impossible to tell who's who and who's even serious. That is, the alt-right is super good at what they do."

If he doesn't make it as the long term #1, then Arsenal will have paid only around 24 mil - why is that incredibly different than other transfer fees for outfield players who haven't made the grade at the highest level? It's not like GK values are plummeting either, or such an outlier like the Kepa (release fee, but still holds true). Maybe they won't recoup that fee, but not a terrible price overall, especially after the initial quotes of 40+ million.

Conversely, if he's Arsenal's #1 for the next 10 years+, paying $30 million seems like a great deal, especially with the rumored stricter homegrown quotas and possible European registration changes. Think overall it's a really decent fee for a promising English GK, who has every chance of being England's #1 in the near future as well."

My professors were all of the University of Chicago school monetarist ilk, except for one from Berkley who introduced me to the left, Keynesianism, etc. In most things, theoretically I sided with the capitalists, the Laffercurve proponents, etc., but when it came to actual real life, my heart was with the downtrodden. Anyway, over the years I have worked as an attorney championing the underprivileged, disabled, etc. At the same time, I leveraged what money I was making into properties becoming a Landlord so that I could retire. So my sympathies are with both sides really. Nevertheless, watching China lift millions out of poverty and spend their resources on protecting and lifting up their own people, while capitalist USA has spent their blood and treasure on going to war and exploitation and the creation of a huge Industrial-Military complex has caused me to rethink everything.  I am afraid the USA is on the verge of long-term stagnation or maybe even a civil war.  Time will tell. The future seems to belong to China."
1,"In creative writing, there's a saying: 'don't give the reader 4, give them 2+2.' This act of participation allows the individual to come to the conclusion on their own, which will solidify that feeling much stronger than if they were simply told something. People like feeling smart and figuring things out.

Taking that idea and applying it to politics, you will find better success at converting your friends if they come to understand why socialism is a good thing on their own.   


You can help with this by helping them understand why liberalism is more like conservatism than it is to socialism. Don't push it, and don't even mention socialism. Just point out whenever there is a clear failure of conservative liberal policy. Comment on the similarity to right-wingers, how they would have done the same if they were in power. Example: Joe Biden is not cancelling student loans and yet he has the power to do so. That's a very Trump-like move. You can do the same with imperialism and warmongering, universal healthcare, wages, etc, etc.

The key is to be subtle and to focus on how similar liberalism is to conservatism, not why socialism is better. They need to see why liberalism is worse. The more they see this, they more the alternative (socialism) will become appealing."

Of course, theory becomes purposeless if it is not connected with revolutionary practice, just as practice gropes in the dark if its path is not illumined by revolutionary theory. But theory can become a tremendous force in the working-class movement if it is built up in indissoluble connection with revolutionary practice; for theory, and theory alone, can give the movement confidence, the power of orientation, and an understanding of the inner relation of surrounding events; for it, and it alone, can help practice to realise not only how and in which direction classes are moving at the present time, but also how and in which direction they will move in the near future.

0,"There’s going to be a lot of talk about the price (even at 24+6 but that’s the economics of football now.

The day Chelsea laid out 72mil for Kepa, that’s the price. We can disagree and scream and shout, but look at the market now. The economics of football are skewed and keep going up. Like, this is the long term reality of the league now. 

Like, I’m sorry, there are maybe 2-3 100mil players in the world right now… like, truly 100mil plus. But City lays out 100mil for Grealish? Is he 100mil player no. Probability wise he’ll never be a 100mil player, but if that’s the price clubs are willing to and going to pay, he’ll be worth 100mil on paper. 

And that’s not even me saying Grealish is a bad player. He’s phenomenal, there’s just no world in which he’ll have 100mil worth of impact ever. These are just the prices clubs are willing to both set and pay.

I think, at some point, we need to do more separation in our own minds as to what a player is worth on the field vs what a club is willing to pay for them because that’s where we the finances in soccer are going. 

If City are willing to spend a price then that’s the price, and if you’re not willing to give that price City will. It just entirely offsets financial impact. These prices are absurd, but we need to catch up to them in our mind when talking about transfers.

The reality is, once you cross 25-30mil, the return on investment on players drops of drastically and economics becomes a bigger factor than on field impact. It just can’t be a proportionate link at such significant increases.

Edit: the moment “you say you can’t pay that but city/Man U/Chelsea will” becomes a viable argument, this disproportionately skews the economics of soccer transfers."

1,"I don’t think this is a matter of collapse as much as it is of obvious dissent within some party members and former sponsors. Beatriz Mejia, for example, is a right wing conspiracy theorist and reactionary who likely “sided” with Castillo out of sheer convenience and misguided perceptions regarding his alleged conservatism. She, simply put, was never a socialist nor a friend of socialists, and this new allegation of Cerrón being a marxist boogeyman manipulator falls right into her alley of baseless conspiracies. 

The same can be said for the “moderates”, a number of party members who will certainly oppose the more radicals reforms Castillo wants to implement (mostly in the social and economic sectors). It’s hardly surprising that these people do not look favorably at what they think is “radicalism”, because by definition a moderate is always fearful of the statu quo changing. 

So, in short, I don’t think the party is collapsing but rather shedding its non-socialist members. This always and invariably happens with “united front” parties, like Podemos in Spain, or even with center-left parties like MORENA in Mexico."

1,"I was raised in the working class. Mom was a devout evangelical, dad a blue collar liberal union guy. After high school, I fell into the Libertarian free-market dogma pretty hard. The anarchist side of it really appealed to me but I didn't quite realize just how shoddy the AnCap economics of it were until later. 
That was really my push into Libertarian Socialism. The strength of the individual, free to do what they are best at and to achieve goals, coupled with a true commitment to community and a real stake in the game. Reading economics papers from everyone from Hayek to Wolff and gaining some real perspective on things reading Chomsky and his take on how capitalism is really imperialism is really the new colonialism but just as brutal as it ever was. 

I suppose I still have some of the libertarian mindset but I realize we have to temper it with service to community. That's what speaks to me in LibSoc."

1,"We propose as an alternative system: Socialism!

Let us just imagine that the number you stated is correct and capitalism has reduced global poverty over the last 20 years (I do not believe this but I guess neither of us seems to have concrete numbers or proof at the moment).
Capitalism has been in place for well more rhan 200 years. If it has reduced poverty in 20 years than that is less than 10% of its lifespan.
Socialism in itself is based around the idea of creating social equality so as to effectively eliminate poverty. While not every socialist country has achieved that goal, many of them are closer to it than the capitalist system is.
Remember here that in global capitalism comparing single countries is not good practice since the consuming countries and the producing countries act as a unit, dependent on each other.

Capitalism as an ideology relies on an uneven wealth distribution which is required for progress.
That inequality is systemic and inevitably leads to poverty if not properly regulated. Other principles of capitalism prevent such regulations though and that ties capitalism to the continuing existence of extreme poverty in this world.

We do not claim to be able to fully eradicate poverty but we would be actively and effectively working to combat it.

But besides poverty and otherwise social injustice capitalism also is environmentally unsustainable and hence there are more reasons to substitute it with something. For example some form of socialism"

Seems odd to me that making them free is such a sticking point, but I'll play this game.

These two are easy. Every kid in my hometown knew the convenience stores that didn't ID. But I don't think I've ever seen a clerk reject an expired license, which an election official would absolutely do.

> driven a car

I spent a while clearing records for a legal aid clinic. Driving without a license/on a suspended/revoked license was so common, we had text templates in use for client consultations that involved them. Hell, I'd bet any judge, attorney, or clerk that works or has worked in expungement and sealing would recognize the abbreviation DSL.

1,"Prior to 9/11 the US was trying to work with the previous government but it wasn’t convenient for them and became somewhat of a hinderance or annoyance because the government didn’t want the industrialization and mineral / oil extraction that the US was proposing. Americans had no issue with working with radical Islamists when it meant they could potentially get money out of it in the form of minerals. When 9/11 occurred the Taliban denounced the actions of Al-Queda and offered the US assistance if Osama Bin Laden would be allowed a trial in a Muslim country. The US denied help and since their relationship was inconvenient for them they declared war on Afghanistan under the pretext that the Taliban was assisting Al Queda since they once offered Osama Bin Laden guest status when coming to their country. The US then invaded and established a puppet government.

The US politicians have never cared about radical Islam, it’s why they are now seeking diplomatic options with the Taliban. A majority of US politicians have very fluid and sometimes non existent morals."

Since Jordan retired, the Pacers actually lead the Central Division in wins, playoff appearances and all-stars. Without tanking (fans in Indiana would never tolerate a basketball team tanking), there have been three completely different versions of the team in that time that have had legit championship windows. How many ""small"" market teams can say that? If one of them works out, their thought of completely differently. Winning championships are hard.

The Pacers have been snake bit by injuries the last couple of years and have had coaching issues. Nate got tuned out, then new Nate thought he was Pop or something. Drafting has also been a problem. 

I actually like the fact the Pacers are being discounted right now. There is bound to be improvement just by the fact Carlisle can actually coach both sides of the ball. Drafting seems to have not completely sucked this year. I think taking a finished product like Duarte will lead to Brogdan and/or Warren getting traded.

Their minds are still developing and they don't have enough life experience so they just parrot what the hear on campus or CNN.  I'm 44 so there was no Reddit or social media back in my day but I am a southerner and my entire family votes Republican because to them Democrats might as well be the devil.  I didn't understand at the time and promised myself ""I will never blindly vote for one party just because I am **supposed** to hate the other party.  I will vote for who has the best policy that I agree with.""  And THEN I grew up!  I got a job and lived by the motto *Hard Work Pays Off*.  Then I started to see people on my team getting hired so the company could meet their quota.  Then a few of those quota people, which I trained and mentored, were promoted because of the quota.  This is when I started to pay more attention to policy.  I stopped paying attention to the media and soundbites and started to do deeper dives.  Reading bills, paying attention to local politics as well.  The more of **MY TIME** that I invested into researching and educating myself on policies, I then realized why my family voted all Republican no matter what.  Of course there are things I still don't agree with from the Republican side, but there is no way in hell I could agree to any of the crap these liberals are pushing nowadays.  In the past three years, they just ran off the road with their crap and I honestly don't get how anyone could support them.  But I do think that's why Reddit is such a liberal mess.  The problem today is that Reddit and the internet in general will just perpetuate their ignorance by living in an echo chamber.  They will only surround themselves with members of the hive mind and never get to the point where they start to question ""what's really going on?"""

1,"Fortunately or unfortunately, the odds are pretty against us ALL dying (unless the upcoming water wars devolve into full nuclear apocalypse).  


Climate catastrophe won't render the planet completely uninhabitable to humanity. It will just make civilization as we currently recognize it, with its huge populated cities, completely unsustainable. Aside from the rising sea levels and uptick in storm frequency smashing coastlines, the shifting patterns of rainfall and aridity will cause widespread droughts and food shortages. Spikes in civil unrest and resources wars will create waves of refugees, which will probably inflame existing xenophobic attitudes as those in charge continue to redirect unrest at worsening conditions towards scapegoats and we see fascism and authoritarianism continue to rise. Eventually, we see a mass die off from a mix of starvation, warring over water and arable land, internal conflicts such as civil wars and ethnic cleansing, and resources become so tight that large scale nations as we know them can't be maintained and collapse. They fracture into smaller regional powers or city states. Humanity still exists, but as scattered isolated pockets and at greatly reduced numbers. Picking through the ruins of the old civilization. Maybe even a few of them might turn out to be small anarchistic communes, but likely it'll mostly be small scale despotism by local warlords and neo-feudalism.  


The real question is how much knowledge gets lost during that societal collapse and mass die off. Of the doctors, scientists, engineers, and all the people who actually know how all our current technology functions, how many survive and are able to pass on their knowledge in sufficient numbers to the next generation, particularly without the infrastructure of large scale university systems and the internet probably not being maintained anymore. If there's  enough collective expertise and functional infrastructure to keep manufacturing solar panels, antibiotics, etc. Or if we're stuck scavenging the refuse. Exactly how far back this dark age is going to take us.   


TLDR: We don't all just die. Most of us die, and the rest of us get to live Mad Max."

1,"Did you agree with Obama 100%? How about Clinton’s policies? Do you agree with 100% of what Biden is doing?

The reason you’re not getting an honest answer (and why I’m silly for providing one) is because you’re not trying to be up front. You’re trying to get a “gotcha” moment, or hope you catch someone go, “huh, yea I need to reevaluate *all* of my beliefs based on one situation!” Which the left loves to do, try and catch people in “hypocrisy” when they peddle in it quite often. 

The answer to your question is I don’t support it, and I think it’s a very bad take. It was also a knee-jerk reaction to the Parkland shooting, a situation that could have been avoided by the police acting on one of their 30-something calls to the shooters home. Or if the FBI followed up on any of the calls they got regarding the kid as a potential threat. Or if the Sheriffs on the scene had nutted up, grown a fucking pair and tried to stop him. Instead they chose to sit back and listen to kids get gunned down. 

To give you an answer you didn’t ask for, more gun laws won’t solve anything. The AR-15 is *not a weapon of war*. Most gun laws are infringements which are unconstitutional and should be repealed and the ATF should be abolished, along with most other federal agencies. 

Now to ask you a question, how do you feel about Biden’s statement of needing F15’s and nukes to take on the government, just to have the Taliban take everything over with nary a whimper?"

1,"Joe Biden's handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal was condemned as ""catastrophic"" and ""shameful"" on Wednesday as the Houses of Parliament delivered an unprecedented rebuke to a US president.

MPs and peers from across the political spectrum, including Boris Johnson, put some blame for the Taliban's takeover and the chaos that followed on Britain's closest ally.

Mr Biden was accused of ""throwing us and everybody else to the fire"" by pulling out US troops, and was called ""dishonourable"" for criticising Afghan forces for not having the will to fight.

Former defence chiefs who led British troops in the Middle East were among those to speak out, while there were warnings that the West's withdrawal would embolden Russia and China.

The interventions mark a deterioration in UK-US relations almost exactly 20 years after Britain joined America in invading Afghanistan to root out terrorism after the September 11 attacks. 

But it was not just Mr Biden who faced criticism, with Mr Johnson and his ministers told they had overseen the worst disaster in British foreign policy for 65 years.

The Prime Minister was accused of not doing enough to rally allies to support Afghanistan as the US departure became apparent, including by his predecessor, Theresa May.

Placeholder image for youtube video: jDPXSrOIzr0
Wednesday's debate marked the first time Parliament has sat as normal in more than a year, as MPs and peers crammed into the chambers with Covid social distancing rules gone. 

Mr Johnson began by arguing that America's decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan had forced Britain's hand, saying it was an ""illusion"" to think other allies wanted to step in to keep the peace. 

""The West could not continue this US-led mission – a mission conceived and executed in support and defence of America – without American logistics, without US air power and without American might,"" the Prime Minister said in a clear swipe at Washington.

MPs from all sides of the Commons were forceful in their criticism. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said: ""The US is, of course, an important ally, but to overlook the fighting of the Afghan troops and forces, and the fact that they have been at the forefront of that fighting in recent years, is wrong.""

Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: ""The American decision to withdraw was not just a mistake – it was an avoidable mistake, from President Trump's flawed deal with the Taliban to President Biden's decision to proceed, and to proceed in such a disastrous way.""

Tom Tugendhat, the Tory chairman of the foreign affairs committee, who fought alongside Afghans as a British soldier, called out Mr Biden's criticism of the Afghan army.

""To see their commander in chief call into question the courage of men I fought with, to claim that they ran, is shameful,"" he said, to murmurs of approval from other MPs.

Placeholder image for youtube video: ktxCt2114_I
Labour MP Chris Bryant called Mr Biden's remarks about Afghan soldiers ""some of the most shameful comments ever from an American president"".

Khalid Mahmood, a Labour MP and former defence minister, said: ""The Biden government have just come in and, without looking at what is happening on the ground, have taken a unilateral decision, throwing us and everybody else to the fire.""

Other MPs who served as soldiers also rounded on Mr Biden. Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader, called his comments ""shameful"", while Labour MP Dan Jarvis described them as ""particularly distasteful and dishonouring"". Tobias Ellwood, a former veterans' minister, said the US withdrawal was ""absolutely the wrong call"".

Leading Conservatives in the Lords also made clear their disapproval. Lord Hammond, a former foreign secretary, said: ""When I listen to the US president, I cannot help reaching the conclusion that this decision was made out of a sense of political tidy-mindedness – we need to close a file; we need to draw a line; it has gone on for too long.""

Lord Howard, another former Tory leader, said Mr Biden's withdrawal ""is, and will be seen by history as, a catastrophic mistake which may well prove to be the defining legacy of his presidency"".

The heated rhetoric has thrust the state of the ""special relationship"" and the Biden-Johnson partnership into the spotlight. The Telegraph understands Mr Johnson had been attempting to get Mr Biden on the phone to discuss Kabul falling from Monday morning. The pair eventually talked at close to 10pm on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, General Sir Nick Carter, the head of the Armed Forces, accused the US of ""shattering"" the morale of Afghan troops when they stopped air strikes. 

A UK defence source insisted the UK and US military were continuing to work closely at Kabul airport in a race against time under way to evacuate people with the Taliban nearby. However, there is concern amongst some in government that the US might soon pull out of the airport, according to Whitehall sources. 

Philip Reeker, America's acting ambassador, went into Downing Street for talks with Will Gelling, Mr Johnson's foreign policy adviser.

While the day of debate was playing out in Westminster after Parliament was recalled from its summer recess, the Taliban was tightening its grip on Afghanistan. Militants shot dead at least three people after protesters pulled down the group's banner and raised the Afghan national flag in its place.

Placeholder image for youtube video: Ou4eXGdtpEA
The Taliban was also tightly controlling which Afghans could enter Kabul airport to escape, leading to footage of girls locked out and begging to be helped by Western forces.

Senior former UK defence figures criticised Mr Biden, with Lord Dannatt, the former head of the British Army, saying: ""The manner and timing of the Afghan collapse is the direct result of President Biden's decision to withdraw all US forces from Afghanistan by the 20th anniversary of 9/11.

""At a stroke, he has undermined the patient and painstaking work of the last five, 10, 15 years to build up governance in Afghanistan, develop its economy, transform its civil society and build up its security forces. The people had a glimpse of a better life – but that has been torn away.""

Lord Houghton of Richmond, a former chief of the defence staff, said: ""I think the American decision to withdraw military support was a dreadful one, and the resulting chaos should be of no surprise.""

Mr Johnson came in for repeated criticism for his handling of the Afghanistan withdrawl, including by Mrs May.

She said: ""In July of this year, both President Biden and my Right Honourable friend the Prime Minister indicated that they did not think that the Taliban were ready or able to take over control of the country.


""Was our intelligence really so poor? Was our understanding of the Afghan government so weak? Was our knowledge of the position on the ground so inadequate? Did we really believe that, or did we just feel that we had to follow the United States and hope that, on a wing and a prayer, it would be all right on the night?

""We boast about global Britain, but where is global Britain on the streets of Kabul? A successful foreign policy strategy will be judged by our deeds, not by our words.""

Mr Johnson talked to Mario Draghi, the Italian prime minister, on Wednesday as he pushed world leaders for a unified position on the new Taliban regime. Foreign ministers from the G7 group of nations will hold talks on Afghanistan on Thursday.

The UK had evacuated around 1,200 people from Kabul on military flights as of Wednesday morning. Around 300 were UK nationals and 900 were Afghans and others who had helped the UK's mission in the country."

Raiola and his like aren't the cause of the current system, they're a product of it. And I would much rather have people like him get wealthy in the process of making footballers absurdly wealthy instead of having club executives getting richer off the backs of those players."

It felt like Arsenal would be spending money on GK evem tho we alreafy have Leno when other problems remain unadressed. 

I was against it at first too, but to be honest he seems like an absolutly amazing talent and with Odegaard secured i cant be happier with this transfer. And with Leno unwilling to sign a new contract it seems.like a very Smart move. Hope Aaron competes and wins the starting spot by the end of the season.

And i have to say im devastated by the way some online dumbfucks calling themselves ""fans"" treated Ramsdale online, hope it doesnt destroy the moment for him."

The NFL GOAT is probably the most contested tbh. It also doesn’t work the same way that the NBA goat debate works, because the natures of the game are different. Rice can be most people’s GOAT without having won a single MVP (he was robbed of one though). A guy like Jim Brown or Barry Sanders with careers shorter than a decade can have an argument against Rice and Brady’s 20+ year careers. Dan Marino can be some peoples choice without having won a super bowl. Things are a lot more abstract when ranking football players because of the smaller sample size. Jim brown played 118 games in his career, Lebron nearly plays that many games in a single season."

1,"Charity is at best toothless and unhelpful, and at worst, a money laundering scheme. It doesn't address the systemic issues that cause poverty, and so doesn't solve the problem, it's given as a way of creating positive PR for the entity donating, and it's done for the purpose of tax a write off, thereby making it a donation in their name but paid out by the very poor and working people it's supposed to benefit. That's if any of the money actually makes it to those that it's supposed to benefit. Often times most, or even all, of the money ends up in the hands of those few individuals at the top of the charity organization, look it up, these people are crooks making millions in the name of charity. 

Finally one must ask themselves: why it is deemed necessary to give the millionaires and billionaires all of the money to donate in the first place? The charity money is given to those that don't make enough money to support themselves in one way or another, regardless of whether they are working and regardless of whether they even can work. Wouldn't it make more sense for those people to be paid enough for their labor to support themselves instead of funnelling the money to those at the top in the hopes they give to charity? Or better yet, use that money to create a society that meets the needs of all regardless of their labor; it's a workable idea.

 No more billionaires, no more billion dollar corporations, no more trillions spent on war, funnel that money into a social safety net and into the paychecks of those that actually produce the wealth, those that can't, and those that enrich us in ways that capitalism refuses acknowledge."

0,"That doesn't really mean anything. As a normal, fairly unathletic guy, I would much rather have Jrue's defense that Jokic's BBIQ. BBIQ, even one as great as Jokic, doesn't really mean anything unless it's paired with other things, such as size, technique, ability to put pressure on the defense with your scoring, etc. Even players that have great BBIQ (even if it's not as great as Jokic) and a buch of other basketball skills struggle to be starters in the NBA, like Rubio.

On the other hand, if you magically get Jrue's defense, you would at least be a rotation player in the NBA. Mostly because defense is actually a buch of skills together.

That doesn't mean that Jrue is better, or that his defense is better than Jokic BBIQ (it's not). It just means it's a more useful skill by itself."

Which is not a bad thing, but don't act like Giannis got in Hardens feelings when in reality it looks like it's the other way.

It's also includes the resentment that Giannis is the hard worker and these others aren't while those players perfected every move in countless hours of work while Giannis profits from his alien genetics.

1,"Hmmm, I feel WSWS can be dogmatically anti-union, which is extremely frustrating, but at the same time they cover a lot of failures of unions I don't see elsewhere.  They just take it to the extreme, in a way that kind of undermines organized labor, and makes it hard to parse how much is warranted union compromising and how much is actual union ineptitude.  But I think if presented with these disclaimers, it's fairly good journalism.  They cover a lot of topics from a Socialist perspective that I don't otherwise find, and while their dogmatic commitment to pigeonhole every article into ""workers should form rank and file committees"" is sometimes borderline comical, I believe the analysis can be informative.

This is to say, I believe WSWS has much higher integrity than say, the Grayzone, but their extreme dogmatism can make their takes undermining on their own.

Beyond this, one of my main criticisms is they don't include direct link citations, like say Jacobin (I'm sure they'd hate that comparison lol).  If you're going to be on the extreme left, it really helps to have direct sources to back your claim up.  For example, I've seen them post about angry union members on a Facebook page mad at the union pushing a bad deal  - but they don't include links or even screenshots to validate these claims.  I've emailed them before about it and got no reply"

1,"Here's what I remember:

For a long time, Afghanistan was controlled by a corrupt monarchy that could not implement reforms. It received financial aid from the U.S. and military aid from the Soviet Union.

During the 1970s, the military took over, formed a left-leaning gov't, and tried to industrialize but received little support from the public because it was suspected to be communist. Another coup took place, which led to moderate reform but failed when it was considered as pro-Soviet.

The U.S. took advantage of this, arming and funding Islamic fundamentalists from the Middle East who supported the Afghan rebels. In time, the Soviets withdrew, and after that the socialist gov't fell apart.

Groups stemming from the rebels took over, esp. the Taliban, or ""students."" After 9/11, the U.S. saw another opportunity to take control of the region, arguing that terrorists based in Afghanistan and elsewhere were responsible, and invaded.

They stayed for around two decades, backing a U.S.-puppet gov't that eventually fell apart when they withdrew. The original withdrawal plan from Janualy involved shared control of the country with the Taliban. That is, the puppet regime would be replaced by the Taliban but U.S. troops would remain until May.

This was not followed as the U.S. began to leave quickly given an August deadline, and the Taliban have taken over."

Look at the top 10 countries in that list. If the USSR was socialist and its problems are to be blamed on socialism, then why should we not consider Chad, Timor-Leste, Madagascar, Haiti, Mozambique, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Lesotho, Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Rwanda as exemplars of capitalism?

Let's ignore the history of imperialism too, because defenders of capitalism like to ignore history and pretend that imperialism doesn't exist. So let's just take those countries as individual cases.

Almost all countries today describe themselves as capitalist and are described as capitalist or could be accurately described as capitalist. Yet most people on the planet live in grinding poverty. What is the excuse there?

Bringing people out of poverty, well most of that was actually socialist China. Oh not a fair comparison, those countries as so backwards, they haven't developed yet!

What do you think about the USSR then? Which was a 90% peasant, mostly feudal monarchy before the 1917 Revolution, then had to more or less single-handedly defeat the German army in WW2, lost 20 million soldiers (1/3 of the population of modern Britain), and still made it to space before the richest country on the planet (USA).

And I'm very critical of the USSR and Leninism.

The worst thing you could say is that socialism creates starvation by accident. But capitalism creates it on purpose (World Bank, etc).

And if capitalism worked, there would be no communists."

The truth is, this was a **DEMOCRAT** failure. **Bush** pushed the Taliban out of power and into the mountains and annihilated al-Qaeda. There weren't 50 of them left in the world. They were on the run, unable to meet, unable to plan, unable to launch any attacks. **Obama** allowed that tiny group of survivors to become ISIS and establish a Caliphate that threatened the entire middle east. **Obama** dropped pallets of cash on a runway and helped the world's leading sponsor of terrorism spread their evil oppression throughout Africa and the middle east. **Trump** destroyed ISIS and the Caliphate, brought Iran to its knees, had the Taliban cowering in their mountains, afraid of just 2,500 US troops. **Biden** allowed Iran to stand up and regain its title as the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. **Biden** gave Afghanistan back to the Taliban.

Failed nation building? Under US protection, Afghanistan established an elected government, made access to electricity almost universal, increased education 10 fold, doubled its literacy rate, and increased education for girls from nothing to almost 40% of the school population.

1,"TLDR: Gay boy, Conservative family, public libraries. The rest is history ✊

I am leaving out the issues that have been eye opening for me (struggling to pay rent, minimum wage, systemic racism, the wealth disparity, corporate greed and the effects of it, climate change, sensationalized media, corrupt politicians, lobbying, etc…) Rather, this is the situation that set me on my path.

I was raised in very conservative small town Texas by your run-of-the-mill republican fundamentalist Christian family. I knew I was gay by 13 and when I told my parents I was sent to conversion therapy. As a way to save myself I lied and said the therapy worked. In an effort to distract myself and seem worthy to my parents, I threw myself into conservative politics and religious apologetics. This was an extremely hopeless time for me. I still battle the mental disturbances this therapy has cursed me with. At 17 I checked out the communist manifesto from the library (without really knowing what it was or what it was about). I knew communism was bad but I’ve never read something that I agreed with on such a primal level. Just compassion and logic (I am talking about socialist and communist theory, not authoritative socialism or communism in practice ie. Soviet Union, Moa-ism, etc.) As I grew up I became more liberal and began voting democrat (only two elections so far lol) As someone who was steadily falling down the Alt-Right pipeline, this was a big deal for me. Eventually (especially within the past 2 years) I became “radicalized.” I guess you could say I switch pipelines from alt right to radical left but I would argue that they are very very very different creatures. As a 23 year old college student who now lives states away from my toxic family, I can say I am 100% a leftist socialist. My ideas on many things evolve and change as time moves. I wouldn’t recognize myself 6 years ago, I wouldn’t recognize myself 2 years ago! I believe keeping your mind open and listening to those with no voice is most important when making these personal ideological decisions. I don’t know who or where I’ll be in 5 years but I know that compassion and justice should be at the heart of legislation. For me at this point in my adult life, socialism is the answer to all the issues our world and country are facing. I hope to use my degrees after graduating to advocate and push for these ideals anywhere and anyway I can. Socialism has blessed me with new hope for the future of humanity, the planet, and myself.
Sorry if this sounds preachy!!! I am just extremely passionate about this topic."
1,">How do libs do it?

Money. These women are bought off."
1,"This is not correct..

If you are a basic worker with no set timeline/Guaranteed contract then they 100% can say that now. See below:

Before you apply for benefits, you must meet three requirements. These requirements include: being able, available and actively searching for work; that you lost your job through no fault of your own; and that you earned enough wages during your base period to qualify for payments.

By offering ways for employees to not be vaccinated like filing exemptions, they put the ""no fault of your own"" on to the employee.

The employer added new guidelines and requirements for employment. They have multiple options to hit this requirement. If they dont meet these, they have left by their own fault."

There was also a rumor that anyone could leave, so people kinda stormed the airport. Which caused chaos and deaths. The Americans and the taliban ended up killing people while trying to control the crowds.

Other than that, kabul is quite normal. I can't tell you about the countryside tho, because there is a massive disinformation campaign right now. Everyone is sharing everything and spreading all kinds of rumors, which is causing more chaos in Afghanistan.

I suggest you get information from Afghans LIVING IN Afghanistan, other than, that be skeptical."
1,"Thank you for laying it out so clearly! I had never considered a system like that. 

It did immediately throw up some questions for me though and I get it if you’re bored of this conversation now but my reservations with that are (1) appropriate expertise about land, including structural risks, limits on size, limits on infrastructure that can be connected etc. is limited to a small class of people anyway (2) isn’t it likely that there will be significant disagreement about what should get built? (3) how would we be able to know if there are too few or too many of a certain type of building in an area efficiently without a market giving indications? (4) how would you decide how many resources to allocate to the construction of a building and who would provide those resources (5) what if there are too many or too few architects, builders etc. (6) if the democratically built building was residential, who would get to live there? (7) do a significant proportion of the population have an interest in or time available to participating in these decisions and if not - can it really be said to be democratic?"

1,"There are some who would say that the unemployed still constitute workers as they still perform a number of social labour functions.

I think society is still fairly stratified - the gulf between someone in marketing and someone working a underpaid job in the service industry is fairly large in terms of income and social standing and class dynamics do still exist in America (I'm Scottish, so this is just outside observation). Hell, even within oppressed groups such as the disabled socioeconomic class markers exist beyond work title, cultural and social expectations as well as income can vastly differ, disability - much like the unemployed and general workers is in no way a monolith.

Demonisation is also not the same as prejudice - I can have a prejudice about a certain occupation and it's expected norms (say bankers) but can overcome it when given evidence. Demonisation is more having a stuck stereotype that is unable to be changed - I think yeah, there should be less demonisation and othering, but having preconcieved ideas about specific jobs based on the observed class composition isn't entirely without merit.

Yes, there's no ethical employment under captialism - but there's a difference between having to scrap together a pittance at a terrible job and knowing that if your job in marketing fails then you have savings or family to back you up. Not in ethics necessarily, but in exploitation both historic and contemporary."

He advocates for social democracy in the short term and socialism in the long term. Personally I don't agree with that, but it would be dishonest to classify his ideology as socdem."

1,"I think it mostly comes down to how quickly and how often the virus mutates.  We still get new flu shots every year despite them not using mRNA technology, so I don't think that has anything to do with it.

When it comes to something like measles, I'm not sure why that virus doesn't mutate into something else that would require a new vaccine.  I mean, presumably it is mutating, as there is always a chance for mutation during replication, but perhaps however it mutates, it either becomes ineffectual (non-contagious / can't infect anyone) or is still able to be targeted by the current vaccine.  Coronavirus and something like measles are entirely different viruses that have different mechanisms of action.  I'm no virology expert, so I don't know what those are, but I suspect those differences are important here."

1,">There is the minor detail that primitive capitalism is unproductive. Hence why capital becomes bigger and bigger and 'companies of one person' become a rarity.

You are correct. Primitive capitalism doesn't scale **but** works well for family restaurants and other very small businesses that only employ direct family members. ""Everything else needs to be a worker-owned cooperative like Mondragon Corporation of Spain. Workers pick the managers (and on up to the CEO) and the workers get a share of the profits. Prof. Wolff is big on worker-owned cooperatives.""

>So what you're saying leads to extreme poverty which is why socialist countries that did allow this, very quickly moved on to allow employment of more people. Like Cuba now.

From the end of the war in 1975 to Đổi Mới (""Renovation/Innovation"") in 1986 Viet Nam was a strict central command economy that didn't work well. Street food was driven underground after being a regular part of life for hundreds of years. It was once also a regular part of life in the US until most of it was made illegal in the 1950's but I digress. Viet Nam allowed the return of street food and small shops because they realized people did better trading with each other than a central command economy running every detail. Think of it as anarcho-socialism on the micro level and more central influence the larger a business gets. Adam Smith said the butcher, baker and brewer would all act in their own self interest to stay in business. An idea that works on a very small scale but totally fails when a company becomes large. Instead of a central command economy I like worker-owned cooperatives as an answer to public/private companies acting against the best interests of their workers and their customers.

I understand that white male socialists can be passionate, well-informed, capable leaders who just want their chance to maximally contribute to the revolution.  I try to be such a person, myself.  Everyone is entitled to speak their own truth.  But personal ambitions and entitlements must take a backseat to the revolution, itself.  And if we do not persuade the primary victims of capitalism (women and people of color) that they will have a better deal under socialism, and not just more of the colonialist condescension that they've become sadly accustomed to, we have no hope of success.  They've been hearing from white cismen all their lives.  They already know so much more about us than we know about them.  It's time we white cismen sit down, keep silent, listen to the voices of the oppressed, and learn.

I am speaking, of course, only to white cismen like myself."

An American invasion of the Japanese mainland wasn't even seriously considered by the time 1945 rolled around, not because of the bombs, but because *it already wasn't necessary anyways*. Japan had already lost the war and it had completely lost its ability to stop the firebombings and naval blockade. The US alternative was to just stay the course and not lose any of its own troops because it could decimate Japan from the air and sea with absolutely no resistance. It's ludicrous to talk about a deadly land invasion as the alternative to dropping the bombs in light of all this, as well as because the US knew Japan was trying to find a way to surrender anyways and both countries just needed to find the right wording to each other to make it happen.

> What role does economic system play in all this? None.

Absolute libshit to think socialists should only care about the economic side of things and it's even more ridiculous that you're complaining about this post being in this sub when you make a comment like that. Successful socialist movements are as much a social endeavor as they are economic, and pointing out the gross injustices of capitalist imperialism is a part of that. It is even possible draw the line between the gross imperialist disregard for life and display of force and the capitalist motives to do so, if it would satisfy your desire for everything to relate everything back solely to economics in some way."

But that's the thing about great managers - they adapt and overcome. Arteta may not have the exaaact players for his style of play, but he has been backed enough this window imo to get us a Top 6 finish. 

His goodwill of winning the FA cup has run dry now.

You got no soul. Wankers running around in air jordan (jesus fuck) psg shirts, not knowing shit about anything psg, because it's become ""fashion"". It's sad. You're the cancer destroying this game, and the governmental bodies are trying to fill their coffers equally, instead of steering against this development. And everyone not playing this money game is suffering. 

Clubs can't even develop their own talent anymore. Kids are being lured from a young age for little money, and sometimes mockingly loaned back to them again. So the club will never make a proper profit off the inevitable. Or they end up in a loan army, where the rich entities are waiting for them to raise their value, to sell them with a profit again a couple of years later. 

Everything for profit. Trophies aren't a must anymore, just a means to create even more money. PSG has only won domestic titles in a b-tier league (sorry Frenchmen), but is somehow one of the most valuable football entities in the world. Because they're (financially) doped heavier than the Russian olympic cadre.

What that creates is a large group of young leftist wasting their time and they end up believe that being a good leftist is just consuming the right things. They watch leftist therefore they are leftist. It diverts their distaste for capitalism back into capitalist consumption.

This is not to say you’re a bad person for watching streamers or listening to podcasts, but socialism is struggle not consumption. You need to go outside, join groups, and help people not just sit around and watch the right content."

Then we have this. A man in very obvious rapid decline. They are clearly hiding him and won't let him take questions because that would be an even bigger disaster. A live press conference can't be edited like this piece was. ABC is trying to cover for him and even then, they couldn't really cover.

""Also, if you think this is all his fault you clearly watch too much OAN and FOX news. What would you have done differently?""

And here we go, the tired ass ""bububut FOX NEWS!"" You can crawl back to r/politics with that nonsense.

It IS Biden's fault because a deal was struck with the Taliban for an orderly withdrawal. Biden decided to scrap that plan, rather than use the time he had in order with evacuate the civilians, evacuate the Afghanis that worked closely with the US and would certainly be executed as soon as the Taliban got their hands on them, and then pull out the military.

Instead he waited until the Taliban came roaring in and then made a hasty retreat, leaving behind over 11,000 non military Americans and god knows how many Afghanis who had helped us over 20 years who are now doomed to be executed once they're hunted down by the Taliban.

1,"Funny, my step-dad introduced me to Socialism and Communism...But he was against it!

He used to work for Radio Free Europe back in the 80's and he would visit Moscow often. When he started becoming my step-dad in December 2000, he actually taught me a lot about the USSR and got me really interested with the Eastern Bloc. 

He's an old school US imperialist but, never once, he wished for it to be destroyed completely, but to complement the USA's capitalistic system. If I'm not being clear, my step-dad saw communism as the necessary super-villain that needed to be defeated in ""battles"" but not completely destroyed. 

4 years later I moved to the UAE and spent 6 years of my life there, far away from the US educational system. I discovered The Coup in 2006 and they introduced Socialism/Communism to me in a more honest point-of-view.

I moved back to the states in 2011 for college. For a few years, I identified as a libertarian because the US government is the most malevolent entity in existence and I felt shrinking it to the point that corruption is no longer able to be rampant, would have brought positive change. 

But, after all that, being on my own and trying to support myself while in college started pushing me more and more left. 

I remember being mesmerized by Bernie Sanders and saw this whole new perspective on left wing politics. I grew up to believe that the democrats wanted socialism and the republicans wanted to ""save america"" from it and all that from my step-dad.

&#x200B;

Now I believe they're both neoliberal corporate pawns and I've grown exhausted seeing every still have that idiotic belief that each of their political parties will bring any change. 

I'm coming to terms that you don't need to shrink the government to stop evil and bring positive changes. I'm really warming up to Socialism for the first time."

 >Socialism is a political, social and economic philosophy encompassing a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership of the means of production, and democratic control, such as workers' self-management of enterprises. It includes the political theories and movements associated with such systems. Social ownership can be public, collective, cooperative, or of equity. While no single definition encapsulates the many types of socialism, social ownership is the one common element.

0,"I actually think Carlisle can turn around the team similar to his first years when he coached the Pistons & Pacers. Before Carlisle got to the Pacers in 2003, they had a ton of talent that was being held back by bad coaching with Isaiah Thomas as coach. Not saying that the Pacers will be the number one seed like they were in his first season with the Pacers, but on paper I don't see why they can't be the 4th or 5th seed with Carlisle's coaching come playoff time being a good edge to have, with the ability to get even better imo. 

People are sleeping on the Pacers and don't know the impact Carlisle has on teams. He turned the Pistons that should have been bad after Grant Hill left town and turned them into the 2 seed in his first season with Jerry Stackhouse as his best player. Turned the Pacers from being underachievers once Bird retired from coaching into the number one seed in his first season. Turned the Mavericks who were considered choke artists and Dirk viewed as too soft to win as the best player on a title team into finally getting the Mav's over the hump to win it all in his 3rd year. I can see similar things happening with the Pacers imo, as Carlisle never underachievers with the talent he is given."

But it's disgraceful to me how we still have so many major organizations and everyday people who look at every physical disabled or neurodivergent person as though they're something that need to be ""fixed."" As though it's impossible that someone wouldn't prefer to stay the way they are rather then become more ""normal.""

It's a reminder of how everything in our world is filtered through the myopic lens of capitalist productivity, even subconsciously. People talk about needing to ""cure"" anything they deem wrong with others and justify it by saying that they'll ""be able to live a full life."" That's ignoring the fact that a blind, or deaf, or autistic person is no less capable of living a life full of meaning and enjoyment...

1,"Thank you for your long message. I totally understand what you mean because I agree with you. 
Even if you don't seem to see it, my poster is about that, the slogan ""Compost the rich"" is about that. The message is simplified (it's a slogan and not a leaflet or an extract from a theory) but we are questioning a complete system. ""Compost the rich"" clearly implies that it is the rich (i.e. a constituted group, in a way as a social class) who are responsible for climate disruption, through their actions or their support for global economic, productive, extrationist systems. It is not 'the people' but a particular group that has privileges and interests in a particular system and has the means to maintain that system. In fact it is a response to mainstream ecology which makes all people feel guilty and talks about ""gestures that count"" etc. Even the term ""Compost"" is well chosen because it distracts from this idea of ""small gestures"" by reminding us that our action must be strong and radical. This is clearly opposed to advocates of the status quo or advocates of political non-violence (non-violence which is often a means of control). The only thing that could be debated is the term Rich rather than Bourgeoisie. Personally I don't mind: although you lose the idea of social class, Rich has the advantage of being unifying and including rich people who don't fit the criteria of the bourgeois class (not enough cultural capital or networks, etc.) but who still dominate populations and whole areas of nature. 

This is far from being a misunderstanding or a youth fad. Besides, if you could avoid discrediting a part of the population (and its ideas) because of its age. That would be nice."

1,"This is a perfect example of how we can’t be trusted to eat the rich because we can’t properly identify the rich. Natalie may be well off thanks to her Patreon, but she also puts a TON of time, effort, and work into every single video she puts out. She’s not sitting around profiting off of the labor of her subjects. She’s creating a product herself that her audience is willing to pay for, and not making anywhere near billions of dollars from it.


Additionally, for a ton of people, her videos are an introduction to leftist concepts. If you go to her sub, you’ll see tons of posts from people who say that her videos are the reason they started down the socialism rabbit hole or how they used to be staunch conservatives before her. In other words, she is directly benefiting the cause of making more people see socialism as a more viable system than capitalism.


Is she more well off than most of us will ever be? Yeah, probably. However, it’s not because she exploited the capitalist system and started leeching off the excess labor of her employees. She puts in her own work to create her own product that people willingly pay for. If we start disavowing anyone who does this because they’ve been “class compromised” then we essentially start telling people that they can’t be a part of the movement if they’re above a certain income bracket. That’s just not helpful at all. I’d be willing to bet that Natalie here has convinced more people to rethink capitalism vs socialism than you have, oh grand internet revolutionist. 


Natalie even states in this video (that I’m sure you definitely watched) that she would gladly pay as many tax dollars as it takes to make sure no one is starving and homeless in a society that has the means to take care of them.


She examines the concept of envy through the lens of capitalism, yes. She does point out that the desire to strip the wealth from capitalists can both be a product of envy AS WELL AS genuine compassion and empathy for the well-being of other humans. Natalie is a philosopher - it’s what her degree is in. Her videos are far more centered on breaking down the human condition and examining abstract concepts. She sprinkles that in with a lot of leftist talking points and helps explain why capitalism is failing us, but the primary point of her videos isn’t to just vaguely talk about socialism and revolution. If that’s what you’re looking for, then her channel isn’t for you. Otherwise, I rather enjoy her content, and I get quite a bit leftist philosophy from her in a more entertaining way than I otherwise would."

I'm not saying the government had majority support of rural peasants. But I'm sure it had some support.

Which pretty much means game over for human superiority, and AI can overtake a lot of tasks us humans do today. Ray Kurzweil predicts we will get there by 2045. But yes, we are getting closer and there are many tasks AI does better than humans individually, but they don’t have general intelligence. 

For longevity escape velocity (LEV), which is the point in time where advancements in medicine improves faster than you age, we will need to see aging reversal therapies show a reduction in biological age through biomarkers or life extension. There are several therapies in the pipeline now, but they need to go through FDA approval. But it’s not unlikely that many people alive today can expect to live way longer than 80-90 years.

So, when we will have a society where machines can perform better than humans in all or most tasks and we are free of the diseases of old age, what do you think we should do? I guess no one really knows how it will be, but we are heading in that direction and it’s inevitable."

1,"Both Soviet and American occupations of Afghanistan were similar. They were both trying to change a society where 95% of the population hated their guts, and local lives were not considered worth saving by the occupying forces and thousands were killed (even more so by the Soviets, there were more refugees created during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan than at any other point in the country’s history). 

The big difference in favour of the Soviets was that the people the Soviet’s put in charge were good at their jobs. Najib was a good statesman, their education minister knew how to run schools, their health minister knew how to run hospitals, everyone was competent at their jobs and there was next to no corruption. 

Compare that to the Americans, they put every single anti-Taliban warlords they can find, most of whom couldn’t even read their own names, and put them in charge of EVERYTHING.

1,"Europe is quite diverse.

The attitude toward Marxism changes a lot from country to country, but even from region to region within the same country.

In Italy some regions were majority communist until some decade ago and being a communist there was the norm, so now it's seen as something familiar  grandpa believed in, but in other regions the Red Scare wasn't far from US levels, while others were more mixed.

Overall today both socialism and communism are seen as funny old fashion stuff by most people here, while socialist orgs are small and don't get enough votes to elect people in the parliament.

Socialism and communism here are not scary or taboo but seen as outdated, kind of like religion and other things associated to the past, when ""people still believed in something"" and ""held values"".

Also, here there is a bit of a stigma attached to the word ""socialista"" because the historical Italian Socialist Party during its last years was socialist in nane only and ultimately it has been wiped out by a huge corruption scandal in the early '90s."
1,"Idk the severity of the things you did, but it might not be you. ""Socialist"" spaces have been co opted by a ton of Libs in the last few years and theyve brought their oversensitivity with them.

Fishman Island: Finding a poneglyph, deciphering it and talking with the King of the Island without the orders of her captain. She took the initiative without anyone knowing. We now know who Joyboy was (a little).

Punk Hazard: this is where her character might seem stagnant but she still have interactions with her crew and seems to enjoy life more and having funny moments. Sharing her Bento with Luffy and compliment Sanji's cooking, warning Luffy about the dangers of an alliance but still going with it despite Luffy's naiveté, showing care for Chopper, etc.

Dressrosa: Caring about Usopp's security when she was pinned down by the tontattas, putting her trust in Usopp despite the fact that he forgot about her after being turned into a doll, Stopping Hakuba easily, fighting with Diamante to protect Rebecca and leaving her battle in the hands of Kyros so he could have his revenge against Diamate and having his moment with her Daughter, Doing her best to protect Rebecca even if she suffered from Injuries. Her conversation with Law after Dressrosa ( I think that's anime-only )

Zou: Relying a lot on her friends, might seem little but seeing her completely trust all of her friends after the whole Enies Lobby ordeal was a great moment for her.

Wano: We knew a ton of stuff about Onigashima thanks to her. She played a major role in the preparation of the raid, her instinct to protect Nami when they were under attack during the bathhouse scene, making Jinbei feel at home in the strawhat crew, saving Sanji from Black Maria, chapter 1020, chapter 1021"

1,"I'm not sure socialism is an economic ideology. It can be framed as that in mainstream economy, as in ""which economic system is best"". But the point of socialism isn't to have a set economic system, it's about developing systems to create an emancipatory society without classes. There have been several different tries in the past, all with lessons for the future of the movement. In the words of Marx:

*Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.*

If you want to understand the classical roots of socialist economic thinking and critique, it will be Das Kapital by Karl Marx. However, that's quite a reading project. You might want to look into David Harveys companion books to it to have a more modern entry into the material. Harvey is also an interesting social geographer in himself, worth to check out.

The communist manifesto is very dated, and it contains for example passages about centralization that Marx and Engels distanced themselves from. If people recommend it to you, do keep in mind that it's an antique program from the mid 1800s, it's not representative of modern Marxism. It's a fun read if you're into history.

As (serious) socialists are more interested writing about the present struggle, critiques of capitalism and ideas about organization, rather than detailing exactly how a future they can't predict will look like, you won't find a plethora of descriptions of this communist society. It's rather understood that it's a new task up to the people who will actually live in to decide. But nevertheless, an early classical socialist book that does elaborate on actual (anarcho-)communist society and how it could function post-capitalism, there is The Conquest of Bread by Peter Kropotkin. It's old, but it can give you a general idea of how the vision for the society is, roughly."

0,I think he turned them down after realizing that Pléa and Thuram were on the way out.
1,"I don't believe it for a second that he was on the woke path when I was there. I worked for him at Offutt and then again when he was the 595th SG/CC and the 50th Space Wing Commander at Schriever and then when he was the AFSPC/A5. I never thought he was a woke guy.  He was a great commander so he cared for people, but never woke.  He was a type of guy that could remember anyone's name.

Space was a small community before it became its own service. We all worked with each other and on occasion I worked pretty closely with him.  I never saw him being woke. But he has been in the service near 40 years I think now, things change I guess."

1,"I don't know how this is a train of thought that is entertained on the left - - everyone who matters who wanted something out of Afghanistan got it. Untold billions of dollars were made. ""they had no plan"" ""there's no forward thinking"" - - we saw the plan, we saw the forward thinking.

Billions upon billions in arms sales, contracting, construction, consulting, logistics, tech - - and that's just the ""legit"" stuff. We'll never know how much dark money the CIA and its cutouts were able to funnel into their myriad slush accounts through heroin and human trafficking.

There was a plan, it worked, and now the country is returned back into the hands of an organisation that the US effectively *created* in the 80s.

As the old saying goes, ""war is a racket"" - - it's best we learned that."

1,"The origin of the argument is valid but the example is a disgusting strawman. No, the Bombs were not created specifically to inspire fear in the soviets, nor were they deployed for that purpose. The Japanese were in retreat, but so was France at the start of the war, so to imply it would simply end because they retreated is a horrible failure to see the bigger picture. The human cost was immense, but it would've been greater, far greater by most estimates, its just that instead of being just the Japanese, the dead would've been Thai, Indian, Chinese, American, and British/Colonial Dominion troops. With all due respect, I hate when someone leads a good argument down a bad rabbit hole and that is what Mr. Mandela did here. He was arguing the right point, but he went about it all wrong with a bad lead-in."

well, this could also just be a matter of perception, cuz there are a LOT more low level guys and many of them make it to a relevant (or irrelevant) media outlet, cuz they either died, or are dying while being anti-vaxxers for the first time."
0,"Yeah. And they had just slightly used Morata. Basically they redid that 2004-6 ish where they had Mutu, Kezman, Crespo, Eidur out until Drogba worked out. 

They did the same to Kepa(£71M) and Mendy. 

Arsenal spent the same on Pepe and have to baby sit him until he works out. Chelsea will never waste that much time on a player because they'll have ready cash to replace him immediately.

It's exactly why the praise of Marina gets is funny. She'll make a couple of mistakes but when your pockets are bottomless, there is almost zero chance they catch up to you. Everything will look like her masterclasses but she's just lucky there is money rubble at Chelsea. At Arsenal, she'd get fired after 2 years like Raul."

1,"Obviously the Taliban are not great people. We however thought they were good enough to give loads of money and weapons to in the 1980s.

The idea that we could occupy a nation for 20 years (10 of which it seemed as if we forgot we were there) and expect it would just work out when we left is the height of hubris.

You arent really capturing the reason for their rage, or why they yell and scream about it being an ""insurrection"".

They know in their hearts that an actual insurrection would have been justified because biden lost the vote. 

They are terrified of the idea of people standing up to them, and not letting them get away with the fraud.

They are pursuing a one party government, and its not something you can achieve by playing fair."

No, what is this insanely cringe ""le classy true fan"" bs. And it always comes from North American fans that don't have a scoobydo about the sport and zero investment in it.

1,"I see where you're coming from, nonetheless it's gonna be a tough one but I guess natural selection plays a part. With the pandemic going on and deniers getting infected, as sick as it is, it is just straight up self caused death at times. The good news is that the newer generation seems to be much more left leaning so if anything I think we'll just evolve via that. A lot of Gen Z is riddled with trauma, religious trauma, discriminatory trauma in regards to LGBTQ acceptance, just overall shit they were made to go through. It's a running joke that college makes people socialists but it's usually not because of the teaching but instead the processes they have to go through to realize how corrupt the world has become. Anti capitalist sentiment has definitely increased and with everything going on, I believe slow reform will take it's place. Exciting to think about, miserable to wait for.  Right now I'm either waiting for my death or waiting for some radical change to improve the environment. Also man, unironically got shivers when I learned that so many of our junky cheap food products as well as fast fashion are made by exploitation. I guess I'll just sit and wait, do my best to not be a part of the problem. If we die, we die."

1,"That group sounds like a load of bollox. I laughed at 'she got furious and called me a ""petite-bourgeois subjectivist"" . So clichéd ! Might as well have screamed 'these ideological deviations are not dialectical!'.

Michael Hudson has a nice word for that kind of stuff: 'Marxology'. Very cringe-worthy. It's just another kind of religion, like Catholicism.

Ideological dogmatism, which is based on a claim to absolute knowledge, leads to authoritarian practices.

In a sense 'ever was it so'. This is just something we have to deal with are try to overcome as a movement, like crawling through mud.

There's a lot of bullshit around the left, whether in 'scenes' or parties and organisations. A lot of cultish behaviour which I'm glad you have your eyes open to, because it's pretty dangerous if you're not. As you said, not like killing people (although there are cases like Shining Path), but just sucking the soul out of you bit by bit. I've had one terrible life-changing experience in particular, though I won't get into that here. I've also had positive experiences.

On the other hand, the group you went to are definitely not the standard. There is something better for you out there. It will have its own problems, but you should be able to find something which doesn't have the creepy authoritarian parts (and also the really shoddy organisation). Also calls and texts at 1 am is not the norm, very unprofessional. Please take this as a lesson and don't waste your life with such people again.

It might not be a general socialist party, but it could be a union or a campaign group. It's best to find a functional group with solid people that are doing something, rather than stick with a dysfunctional group which aligns best with your goals in the abstract.

Sorry but main point here, don't make an equivalence between these losers and 'the cause'. If that's all that was possible, the Paris Commune would never have happened. And so on. Just learn your lessons and stay a realistic optimist."

2) You're babbling. They executed people who took up arms directly against them in a civil war where the white army would capture and torture any communists or jews they could get their hands on. When Baron Sturmberg captured the Mongolian capitol, the first thing he did was shoot every jewish resident. This bizarre idea that the bolsheviks weren't the underdog for most of the civil war is weird. The grain thing is grain requisitioning which was not top down, it was bottom to bottom or middle down, and it's standard practice in a war to requisition grain (during the huge famines of the war as well)."

1,"Mainstream economics is completely bogus, so referring to what is au courant in mainstream economics is irrelevant to its truth. Though I know you made a similar qualification, I want to redouble that.

I'm not well read on the LTV, haven't read Capital, etc. So I'm not taking a stance on that either way.

I am very familiar with Michael Hudson though, who might argue that the reason that the LTV 'isn't very usable' in today's economics is because mainstream (or neoclassical) economics began as a project of the ruling class to debunk Marx and provide an ideological rationalisation for their social position. Hence, while classical political economy, out of which came the LTV, focused on the question of eliminating rentiers and thus on how to quantify economic rents, neoclassical economics threw this pursuit out the window and introduced the 'marginalist' framework which has an entirely different purpose.

In fact, let me quote from an [article here](https://michael-hudson.com/2010/07/from-marx-to-goldman-sachs-the-fictions-of-fictitious-capital1/):

>Classical economists developed the labor theory of value to isolateeconomic rent, which they defined as the excess of market price andincome over the socially necessary cost of production (value ultimatelyreducible to the cost of labor). A free market was one free of such“unearned” income – a market in which prices reflected actual necessarycosts of production or, in the case of public services and basicinfrastructure, would be subsidized in order to make economies morecompetitive. Most reformers accordingly urged – and expected – land,monopolies and banking privileges to be nationalized, or at least tohave their free-lunch income taxed away.

So it makes sense that a labour theory of value would have little to no use in today's mainstream economics, since that economics completely ignores economic rent and more or less takes as axiomatic that everybody gets what they produce.

Now, is the LTV the best basis by which to model economic rent? I don't know enough to give an informed answer there. Maybe it isn't."

But like, it's not a lot of money. The internet could drag every millionaire influence and it wouldn't make a dent that getting just a small amount of Bezos, Zuckerbergs, Musk's money that they profited by exploiting workers. Like every Ancom (not saying you are one) I've met is not interested in doing outreach, they're not interested in bringing people in the fold who is not 100% already on board. Their worker commune is very ideologically pure, but it's not exactly spreading class conciseness.  
As for mutual aid groups...man, I joined a mutual aid group in my city (Seattle). We fed the homeless (despite a lot of very angry NIMBYs), and collected clothing (at market value) to give out. And it was good! People were grateful and we kept a lot of people warm and full of food (homecooked btw). But you know what? The lines are getting longer.  We either organize and vote in people we want or we do a revolution. Mutual Aid groups are great, but if they can actually help homelessness I'd love to see it. I really do."

It's about ""oppressor/oppressed"" not majority/minority; the idea of an oppressive [white, Christian male] minority is not some mind bending idea to those who promote critical theory. This was an ideology developed in critique of regimes like Apartheid.

When the majority is non-white, they are majoritarians [e.g. their criticisms of Afro-European states or Euro-Hispanic elites]. When the majority is white, they are self-styled defenders of minority rights [e.g. their criticism of Anglo-American states or European indigenous populist movement]."

1,"Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, Woodrow Wilsons wife/first lady became a tyrant and unelected sitting president for her husband after he suffered a debilitating stroke. 

She even went so far as to cut off access to her husband from the press, congress, his own staff all while forging his signature on documents. 

She usurped power with the help of cover from the media and democrats in congress from Oct. 1919 until the inauguration of Warren Harding, in 1921. 

Interesting that Wilsons time is marked by 3 specific things; Debt, Degradation of race relations, and failed international involvement/policy. 

1) Wilson is the second-largest contributor to the debt, percentage-wise in US history. Surpassed only by FDR and perhaps soon Biden. And somehow created a year long recession despite the ending of WW1. 

2) Implemented the first segregation of federal government departments/offices. Purged the Blacks that William Taft (R) had named to patronage positions in the federal government. Newspapers ran racially inflammatory headlines and lead to increasing race riots and tensions across the country. The 1919 Red Summer and resurgence of extrajudicial lynching's and violence was across the country. 

3) Had a failed involvement (with tens of thousands of American Soldiers in active fighting) in the Russian Civil War that eventually led to pointless (and forgotten) deaths of Americans in Siberian wasteland, the victory and birth of the Communist Red Army, and a galvanized new communist government that would always view the US as dangerously adversarial. All without an actual plan of action while in Russia in the first place."

Biden Broke The Deal, so the Taliban were then not compelled to honor any of the previous negotiations, which called for a cautious but safe withdrawal. Not giving a lot of credit to the Taliban, but they played by our rules and Biden screwed them."

But when it comes to letting our politicians decide whether or not we can leave our houses or pick and choose what is or isn’t essential we think they’ll nail it?

It’s really not a bad strategy for a small market. You can’t hope to build a warriors-esque dynasty in Indiana. Players will just leave and the payroll bill will come too high. 

We’ve had a lot of bad luck. We’ve been legit contenders in 3 distinct eras over the last 30 years. MJ, Shaq / Kobe Lakers, Malice, and the Heatles kept us from winning any titles. Also a firm believer that if Oladipo stayed healthy and stayed at even 90% of his 2017/18 level over the past couple of years, we would have been contenders in the east the last 2 years. 

When the strategy has worked and had us in a position to contend 3-4 times over 3 decades, why not keep that strategy when the risks of tanking are so high? Who knows, maybe Duarte turns out to be a Khris Middleton-level player or Sabonis becomes an All-NBA caliber center or Myles wins DPOY. All unlikely, but then again so was Oladipo’s rapid improvement or drafting a player of PG’s caliber at pick #10.

Basically a long winded way of saying if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. There’s gonna be some seasons spent in purgatory but that’s just the cost of doing business in a small market."

1,"I think generally your idea to broaden solidarity is a positive one. But one aspect you're missing is that revolutionary socialists aren't specifying classes/worker types just for the hell of it, we do so in order to focus on who to organize. A small business owner may work for example but they also employ others and exploit their labor, generally they will be less sympathetic to revolutionary politics. And cops may come from the working class in general but are class enemies based on their role in society. This is why we ""separate"" at times, in order to analyze the material conditions and figure out where best to put our organizing energy. That is why we focus on more exploited wage workers in direct conflict with the bosses, they have the most potential for a revolutionary uprising."

1,"The FDA approved some bad things, so we should trust something they haven't approved.  That makes sense.

The vast majority of the medical community has no idea what the long term effects of this drug are, because nothing like it has ever been used on humans before.

The reason **why** drugs using this tech have never been used on humans before is because they have a nasty habit of killing the test subjects on re-exposure to the virus they're supposed to protect against.

If the government hadn't ruined its credibility by lying to us during this entire thing, most people would be less concerned about it."
1,"**I'm playing devil's advocate here**

But why shouldn't the USA invade Iraq for oil? We're a stronger and bigger nation, we need the oil. Plus, the Iraqis didn't know how to use it and could possibly sell it to our enemies. If we own the oil, it can't be misused. Life has always been about the strongest surviving.

**Devils advocate stops**

Now, by using devils advocate like this and explaining both sides we can educate people on WHY it's wrong to invade Iraq and killions thousands upon thousands of people. We can discuss things like how ridicolous of an idea it is for some one to own natural resources. Especially people who have no previous contact with politics might think that some of the things I said, makes sense in a way. By preparing the other person for these other arguments, they can understand ""both sides"".

This is something my dad did a lot when I grew up. He made me question why I think in a certain why and why the other person thinks in a certain way. Asking why is a very good tool for education.

Both you and I know it's wrong to invade Iraq for oil but we need to explain why it's wrong. Imperialist propaganda, as we know, usually removes the human part of these things.

Long rant, hopefully this helped and made some sort of sense."

1,"Personally I don't think that's a good enough excuse for the theft that landlords commit against people.

Also if you look at actual examples of retired elderly landlords of the type your talking about there usually upper middle class and live a relatively luxurious lifestyle. 

Actual poor people can't afford to buy a second house and use the second house they don't live in as a source of unearned income.

If we did expropriate them without compensation they would still have the house they live in they just couldn't steal from other people anymore to make a living.

Also we have a pension system that old people are supposed to live off of instead of stealing from other people and making life harder for other people in the process. and I think any socialist government that would do expropriate without compensation of all landlords would as make it a top priority to expand pensions for the elderly to make life easier for old people.

This way once the pension system is expanded there would definitely be no excuse to be stealing from people poorer than yourself."
1,"No I'm with you that onlyfans' prime source of income is based on morally questionable ""services"" especially the way it's marketed towards teenagers.

In hockey both goals and assists award players points, which is a key stat to judge the all-around quality of an offensive player. Gretzky is the all-time leader in points by 970 points. That means if you subtracted his 894 goals from the record books he would STILL be the all-time points leader with just assists alone. 

In basketball we’ll talk about “points contributed” to include buckets and points off assists. Just imagine someone in basketball contributing to more points than any other player in history without ever making a bucket or in baseball leading in RBIs without hitting a home run. It’s pretty crazy IMO."

If you criticized any decision made by the state, and someone sniched on you, a black van would come and take you in for an ""interrogation"". They would either beat you senseless or take you to a Kafkaesque mock court. The planned economy also did not work. I love the idea, but here they just put inexperienced puppets in charge, who made promises and quotas impossible to meet - and in the end, it was the worker at the bottom who got punished for not meeting them. It was not a socialist liberation but a changing of the guards and a mockery of the ideology."
0,"THEORY ABOUT KING: 

King's race, which was thought to be extinct, lives on the Red Line and they are enemies of the certain race we are familiar with.

  
There is no information provided about the height of the Red Line, however we know that it reaches the clouds, so we can say that it is [6000 meters above sea-level](https://i.imgur.com/Q0wWIe9.png), while the ""White Sea"" of the Sky Islands starts at 7000 meters and the ""White-White Sea"" starts at 10000 meters.

  
During the Skypiea arc, we discovered that there are two ways to get to Skypiea, one being the Knock-up Stream and the other being ""The Summit of the High West"".

  
""The summit of the high west"" could be located on the Red Line(Summit means Top,and red line is located West of Skypiea) and since they're just Km's away from White Sea and White-White sea,they could be connected with something similar to the [""Milky Road"".](https://i.imgur.com/HTLLIwf.png)

  
The King's appearance, with fire burning, demon wings, and red eyes, makes him look like a demon. On the other hand, on Sky Island,we have people who have angelic features. One of their islands is even referred to as ""Angel Island"".King's race and people of the Sky Island are the opposites.

  
People from the Sky island and King's race waged war against each other in the past and King's race lost it, almost drawing them to extinction, though some still live on the Red Line. Gan Fall described using the Summit of the High West dangerous and not everyone will live using it to travel. Perhaps King's race will kill on sight, which could explain why Bellamy survived and the rest of his crew died when travelling to the Sky Island, he is strong enough to fight them off."

The COVID unemployment assistance is separate from COVID rental assistance, but there are huge swaths of the population that don't qualify for either. For the current phase of rental assistance in my state, for example, you have to prove that:

* Your income is below the limit AND
* You've lost income directly due to the pandemic AND
* You are at risk of eviction

Unemployment benefits usually have similar qualifications, and in many states are still maxed at 26 weeks per year (pandemic hit \~75 weeks ago). 

So yeah, even these shitty half-assed programs by Democrats still exclude a huge percentage of the population affected by the pandemic."

0,"I’m not sure many people still remember or know that Indiana was *the* basketball state for almost 100 years before Malice. James Naismith wrote extensively about Hoosier Hysteria and our particular obsession with basketball, and the inventor of the sport himself said “Basketball really had its origin in Indiana, which remains the center of the sport.” To this day we still have 7-8 of the 10 biggest HS basketball gyms in the nation. 

I think Malice really changed the self-image several generations of Hoosiers had as proud basketball fans. A lot of older fans that would’ve been integral for imparting the sanctity of local basketball succumbed to ‘’man screams at cloud’ level complaints about the Pacers being thugs and dissociated completely. Decades worth of die-hard fans immediately rejected the Pacers as a signifier of cultural/ethical changes, or at the very least as a touchy subject to avoid. Many typical Hoosiers I know who still attend 20 or more HS/college games a year are still bitterly dismissive of the Pacers to this day.

It’s also worth considering that up until 2004 the Colts and football in general took a definitive backseat in Indiana- but following Malice in 2004 and culminating in the 2007 Colt’s SB win, things started transitioning towards the Colts and away from Pacers. 

I think how the Pacers have approached branding and team building in the years since demonstrates the strange line they try to walk. There’s an emphasis on blue collar work ethic and old school traditions because they have a *state* history almost no other franchise shares or rivals, but there’s a ton of reticence there too as they try to avoid mentioning the alienating failures of the past. The other considerations in this thread about us being bottom 5 in revenue is another factor, but I don’t think it’s necessarily more important to our owner Herb Simmon as some of the other things I’ve mentioned above."

Almost 80% of the current problems can be traced back to capitalism (in both Operation Cyclone and its inheritors as well as Gorbachev’s policies). It would undoubtedly have been better for the DRA to continue existing but that’s long past possible. 

I believe that the funding of terrorism will be massively increased, with the aim of destabilizing the country and exporting terrorists to neighbors. Accordingly, it remains to be seen whether these neighbors will be able to finally stabilize Afghanistan, through a taliban government or otherwise.

This question has nothing to do with the answer. You can fire someone for reasonable and legal reasons (like under-performance) and they'd get unemployment. 

It's the state that determines who is eligible for unemployment. As some mentioned, in some states if the reason you got sacked is refusing to take the vaccine, you get denied. I don't know if that's true in Florida, a notorious state.... for many reasons. [Honestly with this state I'm willing to believe any answer, for any reason. It's almost random]"

But we can also talk about it in terms of relationships - the worker has no choice but to work without having a say in how to distribute or use the profit of the company. The boss/capitalist can through their social position alone order a worker to do things in order to sustain their riches.
And as I said, I think there is a value being extracted, but we can't easily derive the value of goods from that value."

For example I can't see why a shot from outside the area hitting the target would indicate confidence, while one that goes a bit wide doesn't. An alternative explanation would be that somebody feeling low on confidence may not back themselves to strike it properly so underhit the shot meaning it is on target but not dangerous while the confident player hits it hard backing themselves to make it without holding back on power. I wonder though if there is some statistical backing to this."

1,"“The different spheres of production, it is true, constantly tend to an equilibrium: for, on the one hand, while each producer of a commodity is bound to produce a usevalue, to satisfy a particular social want, and while the extent of these wants differs quantitatively, still there exists an inner relation which settles their proportions into a regular system, and that system one of spontaneous growth; and, on the other hand, the law of the value of commodities ultimately determines how much of its disposable working-time society can expend on each particular class of commodities.”

Value is equiblibrium, not price."

One example is how one of our highest ranked ministers was accused of an extremely violent and graphic rape by a woman, and our PM backed the minister and refused to conduct an internal investigation. The poor woman killed herself due to depression and now the police can't do anything. This happened this year. 

But for me what perfectly encapsulates what a massive piece of shit our government is is the case of [the Biloela family](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-56768529). The Biloela family are valued members of their rural community, having come to Australia as refugees, and have given birth and raised two kids here. Literally the definition of a refugee success story. But we can't have that, so the Australian government has spent millions trying to deport this family. They have kept them locked up in a detention centre in the middle of the Indian Ocean for 3 years now, and the children go to school in a police van. Just recently the 4 year old daughter had to be flown to Perth because of a blood infection because she wasn't being given proper treatment. 

But the Australian public will keep voting the cunts in, although hopefully their mismanagement of the vaccine rollout will change that"

He bought a house for *himself* in LA (mind this, LA is really f-cking expensive when it comes to property prices). He's a twitch streamer and is self-employed, doesn't exploit anybody.

1,"I mean I don't see it as ""doomerism"" or ""doomism"" or whatever. I don't see it as a call to do nothing and to just give up.

I see it as 1) a part of the natural grieving process. How can you read about the history of the USSR collapsing and not feel grief? How can you not read about the murder of Fred Hampton and not feel sadness and loss? How can you not read about attempts for universal healthcare to happen in the US since the 60s with nothing to result of it and not feel depressed. How can you hear how the US government is making only surface level changes to combat climate change and have never made more than surface level climate changes and not feel panic?

All of these are natural reactions to bad shit. If you lose a loved one it is natural to feel sad and a feeling of loss. If you're in the middle of a natural disaster it is natural to feel scared. Arguing that not reacting to these is the height of avoidance and toxic positivity and is no more productive than nihlism.

Because even if you feel negatively it doesn't mean that there is nothing to be done. I have been depressed and anxious for almost all of the Pandemic. I have also made sure that people in my community were fed and made sure that they didn't lose their housing, all while still doing my actual job of therapy with them. What I have decided that I cannot do enough about are global or national issues. There is nothing I can reasonably do about the US military polluting and destroying the world. There is nothing I can reasonably do to convince Biden and Congress to finally institute universal healthcare in the country. So...why focus on that? Why focus on electoralism that has failed to bring about lasting change in our country? I'd much rather disinvest from the national stage and focus solely on what I can change in my community (organizing, resource sharing, etc.) then support AOC in getting healthcare when even she doesn't think it will happen soon and I'm not even in her state. Being anxious or depressed doesn't really change what I'm going to do. I'm still going to try to make my community better no matter what. Will I try as hard to get Biden to change? Hahahaha no. Will I care as much about what Florida GOP or Michigan Dems or China or the Taliban are doing? Nope. That doesn't mean that I'm doing nothing though or that it's not important, it just means I'm focusing on what I can affect and change. It's honestly healthier that way."

>but to say it was gonna be “either way” as in the same would have happened if Trump was POTUS I have to disagree

**Don't get defensive**. I know what it feels like to have an emotional attachment to a presidency too. Can I know, for a fact, that the situation would have gone down exactly the same? As you said, no one can know that.

We do know that Trump would have had essentially the same military (same enlisted soliders) and for the most part the same upper brass as Biden has right now. There are no orders that Trump could give to that military that would have fixed the situation. **If you can think of what that order would be, please tell me!!!!**

If you want a different perspective on that, you should ask **someone you know really well who has served**. When you give the enemy notice (and even when you don't) the gears start to turn. Below a certain troop level, you have to begin evacuating even faster and things get messy. This is pretty common for this kind of operation. There isn't anything Trump could have done differently to make this any better (or worse). It is a bandaid that just has to be ripped off.

Without American troops station in Afghanistan indefinitely (which has been the norm for the past 20 years) it was always going to return to the Taliban. They are the power in the area and that area has been in disarray much longer than 20 years. The Soviets made the same mistakes we did back in the 80s. It can't be held unless you want to own it and **pay for it in blood every year.**"

1,"Not OP but the problem in India today is that the left is either limited to elite liberal arts University campuses or in certain belts like Central India( where Naxals fight a guerrilla war in forest terrain), deep South in Kerala. 

Plus, it is highly fragmented along many lines and cleavages that mark a post colonial society like ours. Trade Unions are nothing but junior partners of mainstream Centrist/ Right parties. 

As for the mass strikes, you are perhaps referring to the ongoing farmer strikes? While they are against the right wing Government in general, the horde is itself largely comprised of parochial, hierarchical power structures of rural North India. 

The last time the Left struck together with some cohesion was during the Dec 2019- pre covid 2020 Citizenship Ammendment Act protests in the country. Sadly we lost the momentum to covid lockdown and fatigue in general. The fascists overran our campuses as the police stood by/ helped them"

0,"Considering the institutional advantages those established sides have your example feels misleading. A better one is a kid is rich thanks to inheriting his grandfather's business (Man Utd, Bayern, Juventus etc) while another won the lottery (Man City, PSG). To those below there's no real difference, the rich are rich and it's a team in blue winning trophies rather than a team in red. To the establishment clubs it's a travesty that goes against the natural order.

A good example of how these lines get blurred further is Liverpool's kit deal with warrior in 2012. At the time Liverpool had just came off the back of 7th and 8th placed finishes in the Premier League, yet a sponsor was willing to give them a £300m, 6 year kit deal that was amongst (if not the) biggest deal in the world at the time. They were being rewarded tremendously despite failure, in those circumstances how can anyone actually win without an external investor?"

Ramsdale knows premier league, his data is based on the PL. He speaks English, and will have no problem communicating. People are speaking highly about his attitude.

It really all depends on if armament/conquerers haki can block ki blasts or at least take the edge off as it were

Edit: and I suppose it’s worth mentioning observation haki as whether or not Luffy’s can keep up with Goku’s speed (unless Luffy can read the future like Katakuri) could also determine the outcome of the fight.

(P.S. Also I wanted to point out that any battle between Luffy and Goku would likely not result in the death of either character because Luffy and Goku would both essentially see each other’s strength during the fight and want to be friends cuz that’s how their characters work)"

0,"Fuck this shit. Almost all the high usage players will be playing through injuries of one type or another and different levels of severity. In the playoffs if it's a pain tolerance thing you go. Steph Curry in 2016, his MCL sprain was clearly not healed, you could see it in his lateral movement, KLove never before or since got a stop on Curry on the perimeter, but Curry was still out there playing. 

LeBron broke something in his hand after the blown 50 point JR blunder game 1. He played the rest of the series and he didn't look quite his full normal self. 

Most of the time the players don't bring it up but honestly I think it's OK for there to be some context. At the end of the day it is what it is and if you step on the floor you got to be ready to compete but don't act like people are making this shit up. If anything we rarely actually hear about guys playing through tough injuries in the playoffs."

They’re the most out there about recruitment as well ime, with other orgs being extremely paranoid and insular (I say that as someone who fully understands the reasons for this on a personal level btw).

Sixers want a win-now player in return. the wolves dont have one (or rather dont want to give them away) and can only offer young players + picks. Sixers dont want young players + picks because Embiid is not getting any younger (or healthier).

1,"Socialism is the logical conclusion of the laws of development of capitalism, but a conclusion that isn't promised to happen. The people living in the capitalist mode of production have to fight to bring about this conclusion, this revolution. 

As for dialectics, it's complicated to explain. In a way, dialectics is a form of logic, distinct from formal/analytical logic, as it analyzes categories in flux, in motion, full of contradictions, contradictions that transcend themselves... Basically, in philosophy, you have a whole bunch of categories, like quantity and quality, chance and necessity, one and many, identity and difference, absolute and relative, that are conceived as fixed and as complete opposites, as ""one or the other"" types of categories. Dialectics tries to show the continuity of these opposites, and how they move from one the other, while explaining as well how and why these categories oppose themselves, how they contradict themselves - i.e. a unity of opposites. Very important to dialectics is also motion, transformation. Often when analyzing phenomena with the dialectical method it is shown how these phenomena are historic, whether in natural history (life hasn't always existed and is therefore a historical category, a category that isn't eternal), or human history (class society is not an eternal category but one which has its birth and, hopefully, death). Dialectics puts things in the context of time, in a way.

To Hegel dialectics is sort of logical method, but not a method applied to the world as a method external to the world, but a method taking its source in the world to which it is applied, describing the internal laws of the world and each things themselves."

1,"Right? Not only that, but what is the desired outcome of right wing liberal democracies taking action? Western governments aren’t going to make India more socialist. In fact, they’re likely to continue to exploit and extract resources. It’s funny to me when people call for western countries to intercede as if that’s ever resulted in anything but a country moving further right or becoming more totalitarian. India becoming socialist in no way benefits the wealthy interests of western states.

Now if these calls are for “the people” of the west to do something, I totally agree. We should be, at the very least, showing solidarity and raising awareness. This post is doing that but I just have to call out the irony of asking for imperialist responses to problems created, in part, by imperialism from the same people who decry the imperialist west."

1,"It violates freedom of speech -- [Tinker v Des Moines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_v._Des_Moines_Independent_Community_School_District) I think covers this:

>The court's 7–2 decision held that the First Amendment applied to public schools, and that administrators would have to demonstrate constitutionally valid reasons for any specific regulation of speech in the classroom. The court observed, ""It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.""

If it's a public school then this would easily be overruled via supreme court given the present example. The family of the expelled child can and should threaten legal action against the school for violation of first amendment rights.

As a Hoosier, I'm well aware of the anti-leftist stigmas in many parts of the state. I was lucky to be in a comparatively progressive county, so I faced no repercussions for openly wearing a hammer and sickle t-shirt in high school, having explicitly communist pins on my backback, reading Lenin, Marx, etc during study periods, and so on. Best of luck for your friend in dealing with this issue. It shouldn't be hard to overturn at all as public schools do not have the right to censor the freedom of speech or expression of students, including by administrative action such as expulsion."

1,"> Zach Vorhies, who previously worked for Google, said in an interview with The Epoch Times that the tech titan specifically tailored its news algorithm to harm the former president.

> Vorhies has written a book about his experience working at Google. He said he wanted to “take conspiracy theory and turn it into conspiracy fact” by sharing the practices he saw as a longtime former employee, working on both Google and YouTube projects.

> “People kind of suspect this is happening. That certain keywords trigger things within the algorithm … That is actually happening,” he told the Times, noting that newly written stories about Trump were digitally married with older ones to ensure they remained at the top of search results.

> “They actually have that. They show like a graph, a tree, and they say actually this forms a super-story that spans eight days,” he said.

> “So, with the Trump/[former FBI Director James] Comey thing, they’re able to keep the stories boosted all the way at the top because the algorithm was able to fold a news story into the stories that were preceding it in the last five days,” Vorhies added.

> “They allowed the mainstream media to structure their stories so that they could remain at the top of their search index, of their news index,” he continued.

> Vorhies’ new book is called “Google Leaks: A Whistleblower’s Exposé of Big Tech Censorship.” The book dropped earlier this month.

> “The madness of Big Tech and their attempt to mold our reality into a version compatible with their globalist view of the world has never been portrayed better than in this chilling account by Google whistleblower,” the book’s listing on Amazon states.

> “As a senior engineer at Google for many years, Zach was aware of their bias, but watched in horror as the 2016 election of Donald Trump seemed to drive them into dangerous territory. The American ideal of an honest, hard-fought battle of ideas — when the contest is over, shaking hands and working together to solve problems — was replaced by a different, darker ethic alien to this country’s history,” the description adds.

> Vorhies said he left Google in 2019 with 950 pages of internal documents and gave them to the Justice Department.

> It is unclear what, if anything, the DOJ did with those documents.

> Vorhies also made the documents public with the help of Project Veritas in 2019. The former employee previously told Project Veritas and founder James O’Keefe how he was able to get ahold of the documents from his former employer in 2019.

> “These documents were available to every single employee within the company that was full time. And so as a full-time employee at the company, I just searched for some keywords, and these documents started to pop up,” he said.

> “And so once I started finding one document and started finding keywords for other documents and I would enter that in and continue this cycle until I had a treasure trove and archive of documents that clearly spelled out the system, what they’re attempting to do in very clear language,” he concluded.

> Vorhies spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this year, alongside O’Keefe and Project Veritas.

> “Google, Facebook and the Big Tech oligarchs represent the Trojan horse for totalitarianism,” he said."

What about the Willock we saw under Emery who was getting slated after every match for not being good enough? 

Martinelli is more experienced but he's not experienced enough to lead the line was my point. Every Arsenal fan I saw was happy in the pre-match line-up thread with the team we put out, it's only after the game everyone had a problem. 

Don't play Balogun = Arteta doesn't trust the youth.
Play Balogun = Arteta throws them into the fire.

Look, I dont rate Arteta at all but it's a bit strange to criticize him for not trusting young players. Maybe there just aren't any talents on the same level as Saka and ESR? How many teams have players breaking through from the academy every season? It's not realistic.

>Saying a 19 year old who’s starting out his first full season having” best seasons” is a small sample size and a bit premature, who’s to say they wouldn’t have reached higher levels anyway? 

That's not the same as saying every young player has regressed under him is it? 

>i think you’re just stating things for the sake of arguing at this point mate

Classic line when you don't have a leg to stand on. You can't really tell me any young players who have regressed under Arteta despite saying every single one has. All our signings are under 25, how is that not building for the future?"

I can't lie about US never profiting from war because they have as ı know US has profited from wars and ınstabilty ın central America. But ı don't think it is right to say that the current US government is profiting from any wars at least ones that they cause the thing is wars are expansive and no government can profit from it unless the region they are conquering is worth the lives and the money they are spending the better thing is to just support rebellions and separatist groups and when the nations is in a civil war or a conflict send a ""peacekeeping force"" to exploit local resources.  I support the argument you make and yes US has an a ınequality problem with top 1% being rich and population not having enough money but that would be a stupid way to recruit people US only relies on volunteers ıf they wanted more men in the army for a war they could just send a letter to some of the men that is fit for a military position and say ""Hey you are in the army now report to the nearest recruitment center"" that wouldn't be really hard or something that radical because they have done it in the past ı just think that US government is scared of doing something ""Communist"" and angering few old ppl which isn't evil that's what we called being ""Stupid""."

1,"Well, fair play for actually reading all of that.

Murray Bookchin is definitely worth a read. He was my route out of anarchism really. He advocated a synthesis of the best of anarchism and Marxism. To see what he was saying about local politics, you'd need to engage with his entire proposal which he called 'libertarian municipalism' or 'communalism'. Its central concern is the establishment of participatory democratic institutions. It was the primary (though not sole) intellectual influence on the Rojava revolution. He wrote about it in various articles, books, and you can find video interviews online too. *The Next Revolution* is a collection of essays published posthumously which offers a pretty good overview of his thought. I'm a bit hazy on his arguments around local vs. national elections though, it's been a while and I can't remember where he addresses it in a very practical way. Worth checking out regardless though.

I think the electoral question is a very difficult one (here follows a long summary of the Irish situation you didn't ask for and nobody asked for). For instance, I'm not sure what I think about the Irish situation. Ireland has effectively not had a Left compared to other countries. The space for radical politics has always been taken up by republicanism, which has had important left leaning minority strands but which never attained the status of the Left in, say, Britain or France. Today in the Republic of Ireland, electoral politics has entered a new phase. Traditionally, two conservative parties have dominated completely, which formed in the early C20 out of the war of independence and civil war: Fianna Fáil (FF) and Fine Gael (FG). With the mildly significant exception of a few minority Green and Labour coalition partners, which I might add have been even less left wing than Green and Labour parties elsewhere.

FF and FG are pretty much indistinguishable. FG is more ideologically neoliberal, whereas FF is a little more opportunist. But splitting hairs. The Greens are 'Fine Gael on bikes', and the Labour Party was annihilated electorally for its embrace of neoliberalism and full-throated attacks on anti-austerity movements. 

Into the fray walks Sinn Féin, the 'political wing' of the former Provisional Irish Republican Army. Hovering around 10% in the South for the past 10 years, it is now the most popular party and everyone expects it to be in government next election, due to its more or less progressive and populist programme of resistance to rentiers in housing, insurance, healthcare, and so on.

So what should an Irish leftist do? Join Sinn Féin and try to push it left (with a view to maybe breaking off in 10-20 years)? After all, there are some real progressives and even socialists within the party, even at the top levels (like Eoin O'Broin). And polling shows they have 50% support among under 35s. On the other hand, they have a history of opportunism, tend to be more committed to nationalism than socialism, and have an eerily similar politics to Fianna Fáil back in 1926 (before they became complete wankers). Join one of the many tiny Irish mostly Marxist-Leninist left wing parties? One of the two Trotskyist parties with a few TDs, who somehow haven't imploded yet? Or another one even fewer have heard of? Or start a new party? Or eschew electoral politics and just do movement work? Take up the violin?

It's really not an easy question. (I usen't to have to answer it because I was an anarchist!) These questions intrinsically depend on what *other people* are doing. In particular, when there's not much of a Left, as in Ireland, it's even harder to decide. As long as we recognise that the fate of the movement is determined by the objective conditions of the masses, we won't go insane trying to single-handedly change the course of history.

As for climate change, I know ('know') there won't be a revolution in 10 years in a developed country, but by 2050 we will be living in a totally different world. All bets are off - I think it will be constant tumult one way or the other. The people who believe that this 'normality' can just keep trundling along are really in for a shock. The thing about reality is that you can ignore it, but it can't ignore you. I often say to people 'come back to me in 30 years and tell me what you think then'.

>I guess that for now, I will keep organising in my union and Momentum,working on the small wins against our awful system and trying to raiseas much political consciousness as possible.

I'm detached but it seems to be an interesting time for the British left, difficult but a time of change.

Anyway, it takes discipline and courage to be an organiser so good on you and good luck comrade."

0,"Defense in hockey is not very well defined. Honestly even r/hockey has a very outdated idea of what it means to be good at defense. There are many types of defenses in hockey - just like how there's perimeter defense, transition defense and rim protection in basketball but the defenses are much more fluid and so are the roles. No one player excels at all aspects of defense and/or offense. 

But generally speaking, Gretzky was good defensively. He was particularly good at stealing the puck and positioning himself to take away passing lanes. His best trait however was keeping the puck in control for his team.

Edit: In terms of Mario being better, statistically the gap is just too large. However I saw both play and by my eye test? Mario is the most physically talented hockey player of all time, just a shame he had to deal with cancer. He was actually the guy who inspired Jordan to come back and play for the Wizards."

In the Kane saga, I've seen a lot of comments that are essentially 'Levy can stick to his valuation all he wants and, if City don't meet it, then he doesn't have to sell'. Here we have a similar example where a City player is open to leaving provided City's valuation is met. But the comments I read here go completely against what's being said in the Kane saga and are pointing the finger at City for overvaluing a player. Some even saying City should lower they're valuation to meet other clubs valuations. 

My opinion is, he was worth around 60m when City bought him, he hasn't got any worse since then so 60m asking price isn't an unreasonable value. I'm also of the opinion that no club is entitled to a discount when buying a player and no team should be pressured into selling a player for less than their valuation. If a team wants him, put a respectable offer in and if City think it's fair, you'll have him signed. The exact same thing I think City should be doing with Kane seen as it's obvious Levy isn't going to back down at this point."
0,"Anyone seen any movies lately? 
I watched The World of Kanako and The Intouchables 

**The World of Kanako** is about an ex cop who looks for his estranged daughter who turns out to be a different person than everybody thinks. 

I really liked the first 20 minutes. They are stylish and sweaty with bursts of violence that quickly establish a seedy atmosphere of an unwelcoming, unappealing and uncompromising world where everyone is an asshole culminating in the Tarantino-esque intro sequence that shaped my expectations into thinking that it will be something along the lines of a dark, stylish, ultra violent but occasionally slightly tongue in cheek crime thriller, but it's misleading at best and after the third misogynistic scene, followed by yet another unnecessary scene of violence, neither of which add anything besides shock value for the sake of it, it quickly emerged that this is a movie without a single merit. For like 5 minutes the tastelessness actually works as intended but the repetition and brazenness make it wear off quickly, which means the remaining 90 minutes don't work at all and it only becomes more unwatchable with every instance. It tries so hard to derive meaning from its over the top shock value without knowing what that's supposed to be that any attempt to make this shallow, forced, offensive and disgusting piece of shit have any meaning is laughable and insulting. 

The story revolves around Kanako, who we barely get to see in the first half, and how her ruthless father does everything to find her. But not to safe her mind you, but so he can kill her himself. It's as subtle as it sounds. With every new lead arise scenes where he injures, kills or rapes someone for no reason other than to cheaply and abrasively establish the ""theme"" that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree and make it edgy. The way this is executed is so agressively disproportionate that it's like carpet bombing your house after finding a spider and since it's the only character trait he possesses, it runs its already short course rather quickly, which doesn't stop the movie from constantly doing it over and over again though. It's as one note as it gets. It's either rape, killing, or him calling his daughter a filthy whore without any substance being conveyed at any point or any rhyme or reason to how anything progresses or why things are happening. It's like The Rise of Skywalker with more rape. Rinse and repeat. 

When it eventually focuses on the daughter it's mostly through flashbacks from 3 years prior and the way it's shot and edited is fucking nauseating. As many cuts a second as Liam Neeson climbing over a fence and about as steady as Gaspar Noé on coke.
It makes even the most basic interactions unwatchable and that is before taking the awful and repetitive writing into account. 
How she shows her true nature and how it is explored is contrived and makes sense maybe once. It's actually kind of funny that this supposed mastermind that is able to wrap everyone around her finger has exactly one trick up her sleeve that she applies to everyone even if it makes no sense. It makes sense for the emo boy and the movie cranks up every element that plays into it to 11 to make sure the meanwhile brain damaged audience doesn't miss it. It doesn't even have a sliver of credibility. It's pathetic and transparent beyond belief. 

One of the worst part being where the one dude returns to school the first day after being in the gang's favor. I know it's supposed to be on the nose but it's way too on the nose. It makes power fantasies of nerdy characters in made for TV kids movies where the role of jock and nerd is reversed look restrained and thought out. How this is going to play out is obvious before it's even set in motion and that's something I could tell even though my brain was trying to make me forget this absolute dross while watching it and I'm sure the movie wanted it to be more surprising than it turned out to be, which isn't at all. 

It's so fucking disjointed and the cop is so comically evil that I thought his need to rape was so strong that he was raping a woman in a commercial at one point but that was apparently the wife or something of some mafia dude. Don't know if that was intentionally confusing or it's just a badly made movie. 

I don't even know if ""the apple doesn't fall far from the tree"" or some variation of that is literally all this movie wants to say or if something else was lost in the godawfulness but I wouldn't know because every second that's spent thinking about anything in this movie is a second more than it deserves und I tuned out around two-thirds in because I just wanted this insulting piece of shit to be over. The ""twist"", if it was supposed to even be one, where it turns out he raped his daughter isn't shocking or makes you see the cop in a new light because it's completely on-brand for him, which doesn't make it a twist as much as it's just another confirmation for what the movie already beats you over the head with. And even if the last 30 minutes turned out to be a  unparalleled experience in storytelling, it still wouldn't change the fact that it's a completely irredeemable in every way. 

It can't be overstated how incredibly trashy, vulgar and crass it is for the sake of it, while at the same time being vapid and predictable, consisting of a variation the same 3-4 scenes. It's absolutely worthless and everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves. Ai Hashimoto deserves better. Ranks somewhere among the worst 5 movies I have ever seen.

I tried to watch **The Vertical Ray of the Sun** but I fell asleep halfway through. 

But that was definitely on me and not the movie. 
Despite its simple premise it isn't straight forward at all so I couldn't just fill in the blanks and still get the full experience. 

Maybe it's a bit too leisurely paced but I really enjoyed the cinematography and how shots are framed and composed, always being busy and full of color, occasionally giving me some In The Mood For Love vibes. The writing is engaging and I enjoyed the interactions between the characters. The music was unusual for the setting but worked really well.
One thing that sucked is the terrible quality of the ""DVD"" I saw. This movie has to be experienced with all of its rich colors in full effect. 

So from what I actually saw I really liked it and I'm definitely going to give it another go some time.
If only I could have fallen asleep watching Kanako instead.


**The Intouchables** is about the unlikely relationship of a wheelchair bound millionaire and his caretaker. 

This movie doesn't reinvent the wheel and character and structure wise you've seen it a million times already. But where it shines is with the performances and the chemistry between the two leads, as well as an overall genuine and heartfelt execution. 

I don't think the opening scene was needed, however, playing September by Earth, Wind and Fire negates any criticism. How their relationship starts off isn't all that convincing and one of the few things that felt a bit too conventional, but it naturally and gradually develops into something very believable. The third act also feels a bit rushed at times and it's overall to the movie's detriment that it adheres so much to this basic structure. The necessary conflict for example doesn't really arise naturally and feels forced.
The daughter character and her boyfriend also don't add anything and their arcs are left unresolved. But all these things don't take too much away, even the comedy that occasionally tries too hard doesn't, because every interaction between the main characters, of which there are many, offers everything you could wish for in a movie like this, which makes it rise above its flaws. They carry the movie and it's nice to see their friendship develop so naturally and observe their growth without specifically having scenes that only serve to show that to the audience. 
Even though it's very funny and entertaining movie, the interactions are the heart and soul of it and a lot of the entertainment value is a product of them. 

I don't think it's as good as it's made out to be but it's still genuinely entertaining and way better than most comedies with a similar structure.

I applaud this effort.

The thing is, can it slip past the filter?

The private schoolers and home schoolers likely do not face the CRT filter the public schoolers face. Is there hope for public schools to adopt it over CRT, or is that dead in the water as the teacher's union is in full indoctrination mode, pushing CRT, marxism, and the entire toxic mental brew of the authoritarian left."

States that have adopted branches and elements of Marxist-Leninism are 🇰🇵🇨🇳🇻🇳🇱🇦🇨🇺. The definition of Marxism is the system of economic and political thought developed by Karl Marx, along with Friedrich Engels, esp. the doctrine that the state throughout history has been a device for the exploitation of the masses by a dominant class, that class struggle has been the main agency of historical change, and that the capitalist system, containing from the first the seeds of its own decay, will inevitably, after the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, be superseded by a socialist order and a classless society Marxist-Leninism on the other hand looks to achieve state socialism and aims to achieve real communism once all bourgeoisie ideologies and reactionaries are no longer around to counter it also for the slow and gradual process."

Guehi was performing at championship level and Tomori kept on making mistakes and wasn't disciplined enough.

And then, when the capitalist camp eventually came out on top from the ashes they left in their wake during the Lebanese civil war, they did nothing but tank the economy and perpetuate the state of decay and devastation we still live in. They called it ""The miracle of free market capitalism"". We are a country that can be salvaged, but it would be unprofitable to do so.

0,"I strongly disagree with Sanji is in the 3rd place because someone has to be there. Oda made a conscious narrative decision when he created both Zoro and Sanji as two sides of the same coin, yin and yang, they complete each other as the wings of Pirate King. From their design, one uses primarily upper body, the other uses primarily lower body. One has right eye opens, the other has left eye opens. Their rivalry isn't created out of thin air. They are meant to be a pair.

As for why Sanji seems to always be excluded from the Monster Trio, it's because Sanji is the shadow to Zoro's light. Zoro already had a name attached to himself before joining Luffy, and is easily the most recognizable name in the Straw Hats, while Sanji is given an entire different role of working in the shadow, like a spy or stealth expert. In a way, Sanji works like a hidden trump card that Oda likes to use to catch the enemies off guard. This is also the reason why he got his bounty photo taken last, because Oda wants to keep Sanji in the shadow for as long as he could, because things will change once WCI comes. Sanji's bounty now being higher than Zoro signifies this change where the world finally recognizes that Luffy has more than one pillar support.

One last thing I want to mention is Luffy's dream is pretty much Zoro's and Sanji's dream combined. The competitiveness of being a pirate king is similar to Zoro wanting to be the strongest swordman, while One Piece the treasure is as mythical as All Blue. This is why saying that only Zoro shares similarity to Luffy is blatantly false, as Sanji also shares just as much as Zoro, even down to having a mentor with a missing limb."

my mother’s grandparents who came from Sicily were socialists running from the government and the mob, and when they got here my great grandfather became an organizer in the states. so i grew up hearing about that in glowing terms, even have his copy of Roberts rules actually. 

it also helped that i grew up in Texas, in a particularly conservative place even for here, and even having progressive politics will get you called a commie. which eventually has the effect of teaching you “so wanting good things for the world and the people in it means i’m a commie”, which kind of makes that transition easier imo. if all good things are a sign of communism, why wouldn’t you be a communist right?"

Now for the reason to why the US get into armed conflicts.  The initial thought is that resources are the reason, but since globalization resources scarcity has most gone a way for most countries.  Resources still play a role, but they are indirectly involved.  One example is oil, the US does not need to control foriegn oil, but are trade partners do.  The UAE and other countries are extremely concerned with the price of oil and countries which sell oil at a lower price will hurt them financially.  This is one of the reasons the US and Iran are having issues.  It is not about their nuclear technology, but how much oil they are selling.
  
  
Like I said resources still have some sway over the conflicts the US becomes engaged in, but the main driving factor is politics.  Look at China, US, and Russia they are all competing for control of the global market.  China has been very vocal about its currency becoming the defacto currency.  It is attempting to do this by selling infrastructure in developing countries.  These developing countries now have a debt to China and China can influence their economy.
  
  
The US does something similar, but does this with military aid and humanitarian aid.  Some countries ask the US to become involved in their country's sovereignty by requesting assistance against a foreign government.  Ukraine has been asking for assistance against Russia for years but has been denied because well it is Russia.  Another example is the Syria and ISIS.  This was a major geopolitical crisis and I will not attempt to summarize the whole thing, but the short of it... Turkey and neighboring countries were extremely afraid of who ISIS would align with once they had control of Syria, think cold war era concerns.  This is why foreign powers got involved directly.  The hope was that after ISIS was taken care of the Syrian government would be able reestablished itself.
  
  
The final example is when the US gets involved due to humanitarian reasons.  An example of this is Cambodia after its civil war.  The US used its troops to remove civilians after the war ended, because of the known genocide at the time.  This a massive summerization of what was happening at the time.
  
  
The point I am trying to make is resources have no longer been the driving reason for since WW1.  War or armed conflicts are greatly influenced by political interests.  Look at the cold war, most Americans think this was about the spread of communism, but the US was afraid of the USSR sphere of influence.  The whole reason South America is having issues right now is because of the political puppets that were set up during the cold war.

Edit:

Forgot to include something helpful for learning.  Look up commanding heights.  It is both a book is documentarian film.  Real great for explaining how socialism and conflict are shown together."

The 1 trillion in losses is totally true, but that trillion was paid by the ""common American"" , basically the poor class who got worst end of it once more, not only because they literally paid this war but because that trillion could be used to significantly improve their lifes. Meanwhile we have the contractors and the military industry shareholders who got to pocket the majority of this trillion. Check the financial graphs of the biggest US  war industry companies.

That could be true, but I thinks, based on basic human psychology, it is much easier to get recruits if you give them the illusion of choice. Instead of giving the population a direct order(wich could go really badly, cause in that case all the schemes would be much clear,  and so it would be much easier to protest, cause they would have a direct measure to protest against(that why we our criminal systems(punishment)has gotten more hide from the public eyes over time(Read Vigilance and Punishment by Michael Focault). It is much more esiers for the power to give you the illusion of choice that a direct order, it is much more safe. 
Basically the Is government is saying, ""you are not obliged to go the army in any way, only if you want, while at the same time they saying, listen if you go the the army we will give you HealthCare, pay for you college, give you a job, make you a hero and you will get to see the world(just see a typical US army propaganda paper,  they are literally selling a dream)."

1,"I think people are taking somewhat of an antiquated view with this, and I don't think that just because ""it's not harming any workers"" doesn't mean it's entirely acceptable. Piker, as well as most YouTubers, streamers, podcasters etc. make their money off subscriptions and donations, so the more streamers and subscribers you get the more income you're pulling in. Sure, it's mostly if not entirely based on their own work, but it does quickly become a lot of money without much of a price decrease to make content more accessible.

When it comes to content creators oriented towards left-wing content, the point still stands that if they're raking in cash to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars a month (each member of CTH makes between $10k and $20k on Patreon; CumTown makes about as much if not slightly more per person) that if they choose only to use it on themselves, it does raise the question what they're doing it for.

If I were in the position where I was making left-wing content every day and espousing political views that align with the socialist/communist set and I really felt it, I would feel somewhat responsible for ensuring that if the government wasn't taxing me that I was still finding a way to build up my community and contribute to the people who need it as much as possible. The only content creator I know of who actually releases financial reports based on her earnings and how that money is spent is Anita Sarkeesian, and I think if these people want to prove that their money is where their mouth is they should do something similar.

I have no issue if Piker wants to buy a house, my issue is whether or not he's going off about left wing politics while still putting himself first with no regard for his community. That just seems like a grift to me, and the richer some of these people get off their content the more it feels that way.

1,"As I wrote, in the field of economics it is dated, as in it's not very usable. Like many early (or more modern, for that matter) economical theories, it lacks empirical evidence. This doesn't make it untrue, nor that any other theory of value is therefore correct. And as I also wrote, this is also because economics have become a very narrow discipline. But the LTH has to be seen in a more broad social sciences context, to be useful to us.  


Or as David Harvey wrote:  
*""Ricardo’s hope was that the labour theory of value would provide a basis for understanding price formation.  It is this hope that subsequent analysis has so ruthlessly and properly crushed.  Marx early on understood that this was an impossible hope even as he frequently slipped (I suspects for tactical reasons) from values to prices in his presentations as if they were roughly the same thing.""*  


Really, it's somewhat of an un-marxist thing to be married to the idea of the LTB, it was just a general idea that many economists used during the time - it's not something Marx invented or championed. He did use it as a stepping stone to model class relations, and that's what it's interesting for.  


David Harvey concludes with this:  
*""Marx’s value form, I conclude, is not a still and stable fulcrum in capital’s churning world but a constantly changing and unstable metric being pushed hither and thither by the anarchy of market exchange, by revolutionary transformations in technologies and organizational forms, by unfolding practices of social reproduction, and massive transformations in the wants, needs and desires of whole populations expressed through the cultures of everyday life.  This is far beyond what Ricardo had in mind and equally far away from that conception of value usually attributed to Marx.""*

1,"Bush was absolutely NOT a conservative.  He was a globalist wearing a conservative sticker.  We were coming off the shock of having our homeland attacked in a spectacular way which gave way to anger.  Before we knew it, we were involved in a war in Iraq  that spilled over into Afghanistan.   I think a lot of Americans wanted revenge for their loved ones' needless deaths.  

Like Vietnam and Korea, politicians and suits were directing the war instead of letting the commanders on the ground, and the soldiers were supposed to sort of fight them and not destroy them.    

So, in essence, this was not a conservative's war.  This was a war for the amusement of politicians, the bankers, and the war machine.  

I am livid at the senseless loss of life of our fellow Americans for this fool's war.  

Ron Paul was right."

Winning on the ground requires, by necessity, that you challenge the existing ideas, which makes people uncomfortable. This however conflicts with rainbow capitalism, pursuing the profit motive means pursuing the largest possible market.

The profit motive and activism can not coexist. Those pursuing the profit motive actively struggle against the people challenging ideas because the people challenging ideas make others uncomfortable resulting in a smaller market.

This is why you see such a war going on in the lgbt community about companies involving themselves in or coopting Pride - a radical liberation event - instead of making their own events separate to Pride. 

They want to take over Pride and turn it into a profitable fun family day out instead of using it to challenge ideas. They are actively deradicalising and neutering it by pushing out the activists and organisers who defend the radical and defend representing a real challenge to existing ideas and social norms."

1,"Both my parents grew up in the USSR and they say it really depended on where you were living. For example, in Moscow, most shops were well-stocked however my father lived in the outskirts of a small town and he would occasionally have to travel a fair distance to find a shop with the food they needed. More luxurious items like beer were almost always sold out (especially towards the end of the 1980s), food expiration dates were missing and items would only stop being sold when they became obviously expired.

The USSR didn't go from a perfectly functioning society to rugged capitalism overnight and blankly stating that there was no famine after the start is just false. Even just thinking about that, during the second world war the government adopted a [scorched earth policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_earth) and Soviet soldiers burned crops, dislocated huge amounts of people as they retreated and Stalingrad was a fucking hellhole for 4 years. After this, massive quantities of resources were re-allocated to the cold war and the nuclear program along with proxy wars with America while the western USSR had to recover from the war which took time. During this time there was famine and while it was not as widespread toward the end of the USSR, there were many areas that could not get enough food due to governmental priorities and massive embargos.

Having said that. That wasn't the fault of communism and I completely agree with OP despite me preferring socialism to communism."

This isnt a translation thing either, even in Japanese he says ""kodomo no kodomo"" which is also roundabout and ambiguous to gender. Also the physical traits Luffy and Garp share don't seem to be shared by Dragon, which makes sense if Luffy gets his looks from his mom instead."

1,ObamaHussein should be in Guantanamo for treason and conspiring with the enemy within.
0,Wtf
1,The American people need to know Obama is one of them
1,I believe it’s time to recognize the fact that he das plans to make the USA a Muslim country. Time to export him.
1,"Trump released their military leader and 5K Taliban, pulled out 10K troops and let them take over Afghanistan. You voted for a traitor, you own the consequences."

But I thank all those who placed the contact information of Dr, LUCKY on the internet because through that I have been able to contact Dr, LUCKY and today my relationship has been restored with love and more Respect than ever before.

1,Voting for Obama is coming back haunt us.
1,"The cabinet of the new “government” of Afghanistan is made up of mostly “UN terrorist watch list” people

Just great!!"
1,"We will likely be hit again by these savages, and the intelligence community believe it will be much worse than 9-11, likely with nuclear weapons."
1,The new Afghan interior minister is on the US terror list and has a $10 million bounty on his head but I'm sure we can negotiate with these people. The new Prime minister is on the UN Black List. What could possibly go wrong? prm
1,"Why did Afghan army collapse so quickly?

“The reason why it collapsed so easily is because Donald Trump informed everybody that there was drawl date was May 1st. When he was still in office he was quietly drawing down on the troop strength to the extent that his military advisers told him they didn't have enough military presence to protect Americans, the Afghan government, and the Afghan Army. It was Donald Trump who actually negotiated with the Taliban to release 5000 Taliban soldiers back into Afghanistan which totally undermined the government and so demoralized the Afghan military they gave up.”.."
0,No kidding
0,Before nko
1,Like many other things Obama / Biden did to damage this Country & others
1,"But Donnie's release of over 5000 taliban prisoners was ok.
🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄"
1,"The exchange is working out precisely as intended by Bath House Barry who supports the Islamic terrorists, always has."
1,"Well of course they are because Obama was helping them just like Creepy Joe is .
Obama gave them their leaders back and Joe gave them $800 billion in American weapons and their country back."
1,"Call the maga death squad at work here for the Taliban regime and Pompeo the deal maker.
Traitors"
1,Kevin Jackson you getting all pumped calling people snow flakes. Jacked up on the COOLAID I see 👀 But I hear you. 👉YOU R👈 doing some cult thing I need to be ready for on the Sept 18th. ⚠🚨⤴💪🇺🇸. Bless UR little Non Patriot heart.
1,"Yes, I agree trump failed America in July 2020, when he released 5,000 prisoners and one being their current leader. Why did he remove the troops? Oh that’s right trump was in bed with them. It’s all Don the con Trump’s fault…

“YOUR REMINDER that when four American soldiers were killed in Niger in 2017 because of Trump, Trumps response was to say nothing for Twelve days and then he called one of the solders widow a LIAR.”

Remember under Trumps watch 62 troops died in Afghanistan,Yet
you sat silent…
Now that Biden is President you care all of a sudden? You know Im right, it has nothing to do with the troops… but rather your Politics, so sad… #youmustbearepub

We have serious problems to solve like wildfires, economic inequality, housing, and healthcare. The last thing voters want is a TALKING HEAD."
1,"It is rigged, and the idiots will vote for the same failed policies that are sending droves of people and businesses out of the state of California. I guess they are happy getting attacked by homeless people on the beach with machetes, and dodging piles of 💩💩💩 on the sidewalks and streets."

California's problems are out of control. A person who cares and loves his state doesn't allow ALL those terrible things to happen OR continue. People are leaving, business are leaving IN DROVES. Ask yourself why...Doesn't that tell you something, anything? It tells you Newsom is a worthless, good for nothing LOSER. Wake up California! Bring back your once great state to what it was, what it used to be. But I guarantee it won't be that under Newsom. You can take that to the bank, if you have any money left from high taxes, closed business and no tourism. Larry Elder is smart, cares about your state, the people, bringing your state back to what it was, what it used to be, and he will do that instead of giving you lip service like Newsom does."

Til Gabriel blows his horn.

The lyrics are set to the tune of ""I've Been Working on the Railroad."" It is common practice that the last line, ""Til Gabriel blows his horn,"" is sung and played to a slightly slower tempo than the rest of the song. Students, faculty, staff, athletes, and alumni punctuate each beat of the last line with a small chopping motion of their right raised arm and ""Hook 'Em"" hand sign."

0,Not the lighter. Industry baby music video. lil Nas X inspo.

This way when they arrive the ground, they're much more than the initial one that entered the Earth. So why are bits change more frequent if we go in a high altitude or in space? Shouldn't they be more frequent on the Earth ground since they become many more by hitting air particles?"

0,The first suicide squad wasn't bad its just a very different version of all the characters 😂
0,wich music is this 13:22 ?
0,Dude what even is that thumbnail
0,Because of the director
0,"I was reluctant to watch this movie because of how bad the first one was but you changed my mind and I'll give it a shot. It's disappointing that HQ is still a dumb character, it would have been great to either see her be the original or have WB do something like in the Batman: Whiteknight comics where there were two Harleys and the Joker was too mentally ill to notice that they were two different people until he took the non approved drugs he stole to treat his mental illness."
0,"I have this take where I from the videos I watched of Filmento and I watched a lot of his videos I think He doest know that much about the stuff he says. He just says things to sound like he knows what he is talking about. And why doesnt he critique when there was something shit about a movie like its not just worst or best movies you can have a movie that is ok but has its flaws but when the people say It was good He says It was good and vice versa I just think the whole Filmento channel is fake and if you understand it good , if you dont then thats your opinion. Well either way you can watch it to kill time . I bet ""why did shang-chi worked where the Black Widow failed "" will be out soon. Oh and I cant wait for the Filmento cult to comment on this

 Sorry so he already made a black widow failed video so my fortune telling will not come true"

0,"Captain boomerangs death hit me hard, I think cause im australian and we dont really have alot of australian superheros/villains and I just attached to his character super hard and was really looking forward to seeing his character get more in this movie, oh well. V sad."
0,"Harley Quinn is still annoying in this one, also the first half of the movie was good, but the second half was kinda shit, plus they killed the polka dot man which was one of the only two that had any care in his body for other people(he even remembered milton, i didnt even remember milton) plus they killed him in the dumbest way possible, the movie had some funny humor but it also did alot of the""america bad"" shit that was kinda cringe, the original iron man trilogy showed how to do the evil american government thing in a noncringe manor so did wolverine; the big end fight was very much a let down as only three people actually got involved and one(polkadot man) was instantly killed the moment he finished his arch; the main character bloodsport was almost utterly useless this entire film except in leading at the end and saving ratcatcher 2; the fight between peacemaker and bloodsport was so disapointing, this entire movie they suck each other off trying to prove how cool and prove that they are equal fighting wise and when they started to fight I thought ""wow this is gonna be a cool fight"" but no it lasted 2 seconds and was an utter disapointment, this movie was a step in the right direction for dc but it is still a shit movie(except for polkadot man and milton, they were mvps)"
0,"14:20  I think it's on purpose, Amanda Waller is the real bad guy in the suicide squad"
0,Do they ever explain what happened to the last members of the first suicide squad?
0,"I really like Harley's portrayal here--but I'm a big fan of her stand-along comic series, which is what Birds of Prey and The Suicide Squad seem to be pulling from. She's not an idiot--she just finds it more convenient for people to think she is. At the same time, she's impulsive and works from an emotional center (hence shooting Luna when she saw his ""red flags""). I love Rat Catcher 2, and I genuinely hope we see her character again, and I was surprised how attached I got to both Polka Dot Man and Nanaue by the end. I was really rooting for Polka Dot Man, his sudden death hurt a lot."
0,"It’s only a faint impression, but I got the slightest impression from this video that this commentator is not a huge fan of Waller’s character."
0,:)
0,"Honestly I disagree with you on a key point. Having a movie with a plot that jumps back and forth with the flashback-type events isn’t a bad way to make a movie. Sure a straight progression plot is good and traditionally preferable I personally love the cut back and forth style. That’s not to say the first movie was great but it comes down to preference. People don’t think in linear progression, your mind is constantly flipping back to previous situations and things you know about people or places. It was kinda like seeing into the minds of the slightly crazy characters in the first movie and I wish the second had kept at least a bit of that style"
0,The one thing I liked in Suicide Squad was the villain character Enchantress. I thought the design was cooler than Starro the Destroyer (which was still cool)
0,So that’s not deadshot? It’s bloodsport?
0,"bro i feel so fucking bad for savant
he was assigned to a group with a bunch of losers who couldnt carry a tenth of their own weight, and ran away because there is no reason not to, only to be killed by a devil woman with no moral compass. man literally watched his entire team get massacred to a degree i cannot explain, and knew that he is automatically dead, no matter how you put it. #freesavant"
0,Honestly I was a little bummed after cap boomerang was killed (Him being the only aussie in the bunch so I could kinda relate to him) but after seeing the rest of the movie I realised this was the only way he could actually fit in to the movie. And I enjoyed the movie a lot
0,"So I didn't watch the new Suicide Squard. I thought it would be just as silly as the first one. I'm only 2:45 in, and I'm getting the impression the new one was way better than the old one. I'm not gonna watch any more of this vid till I see the movie"
0,"Hearing John Cena say

0,I actually liked the first suicide squad better than the new one.
0,"This movie was so much better, because it didn't take itself so seriously."
0,Polka dot man is irrelevant and that's why they made his death so insignificant
0,"This was legitimately my first time seeing hobbits next to other characters and I’m losing it at how small they are

0,well also helps that the movie wasn't dark 80%of the time
0,"Theres no violence if theres noone to be violent with
-Peacemaker"
0,"I really feel this joker would've been interesting If they made him a broken robin, a billionaire's adopted kid trained by batman who got turned by the joker. It would've worked so perfectly on paper specially the way Ben Affleck wanted his batman to be (for example Bale's batman or any other batman it just wouldn't work because of the playboy side, but Afflecks batman was a broken billionaire who lost a son, the stubborn version of batman that always fights with Jason. It could've really worked)
Think about it, the tattoos would make sense he is a billionaire's kid trying to act gangster while also being a legitimate threat. Anything weird or goofy looking can be explained as the joker turning this kid into something batman hates, something that billionaire Bruce Wayne would never accept.
 How do you make robin/joker a threat? Killing the real joker and having batman as a father.
Batman would never kill his own child and even if he does want to it can be explained as batman wanting to stop his son at all costs (an evil mini batman/ mini joker baby is very dangerous to be left alive, the joker is unpredictable but batman knows this so he thinks outside of the box, how do you stop something that thinks like batman but acts like the joker?). What a wasted opportunity."
0,"batman vs superman, haley quin vs the army... well fuck logic"
0,"To be fair, TDK's name in the comics is ""Arm Fall-Off Boy"" then later ""Splitter"", so not even DC diehards would've recognized him."
0,The reason it worked was because they stayed the hell out of the way and let James Gunn do his thing.
0,the fact that it ended with a bunch of rats eating a giant space starfish makes it a 10/10 in my book
0,"Say what you will about this movie, it looks terrible in my opinion, the CGI makes me want to gouge my eyes out."
0,"I think if they portrayed Harley Quinn as a figure with more agency, rather than a hypercompetant dimwit, she'd be more engaging (at least to me). I don't hate Harley Quinn as she is but I think if they showed her as more of a figure that uses her goofy and unpredictable demeanor to get what she wants, she'd be a lot more respectable and would make sense with her status as a doctor. I don't mean go completely stonefaced once she has what she wants, but just the sense that her zaney personality is also tactical. It would encourage me more to see Birds of Prey."
0,Bruh all you had to say was they now have a better director😂
0,"Lol the original was 10x better than this stupid shit,,did u watch both the movies lol"
0,"I hate the current stile of Harley Quinn where she is betrayed as an idiot, sure she may have some problems but she has a PhD in psychology she isn't dumb"
0,Impressive film reviews. You’ve got skill. Movie companies should use you to vet their scripts.
0,"I disagree on your take on harley quinn, which is actually rare, I love ALL of your stuff and learnt so much from you. However, I think that harley's escape sequence is one of the best harley quinn representations I've seen in a while. Remaking her whole character after coming from suicide squad and birds of prey was hard, so keeping her core as a crazy young girl who plays dumb was the start. So how you make that interesting? Make her a proactive and competent character. She likes the hot rich asshole? She shows that after her deal with the joker she learnt to read red flags and avoid them. She gets captured? She plays dumb and crazy until she can ambush the guard and break free. She's surrounded by guards? she shows to be as deadly as our main characters Bloodsport and Peacemaker.  A teammate about mess up (polka dots blasting the guards near the explosives)? Show that she really plays dumb, but is actually aware of the situation, and her quick reflex saves polka dots life.  Need to give a character arc to a static character? Giver her a joke MacGuffin that ends up saving her life and being key to defeat the obligatory big cgi monster.

All this gives us a proactive character who's as smart, extremely competent and deadly, while also remaining true to the core of this dcu harley quinn of being innocent and crazy. The one moment where she's shown to be vulnerable was when Flag told her they were going to rescue her. And it was really sad, the way she hugged him coupled with her previous badassery really made me care for her character, and when she used the javelin to stab starro's eye I was cheering for her."
0,"Wait people actually thought this movie was good? I mean maybe compared to the first one, but as a movie on its own it was just garbage"
0,Tbh I like how the suits seem weird in the modern movies
0,"I think what makes this better is that The Suicide Squad doesn’t take itself seriously. When you look at it from afar, the concept of villains doing good sounds pretty weird, so seeing it take a dark, edgy turn makes it seem pretty dumb. But when you take these characters who didn’t belong it that dark genre, and put them in a movie where everyone is just having fun, it has a drastic difference that is much better."
0,"I was really sad for Starro. It's last words were ""I was happy floating and looking at the stars.""
It had no intention of being a conqueror or a destroyer of any kind until it was captured and tortured for 30yrs."
0,Huh I felt like the The Suicide Squad was a sequal to Suicide Squad...
0,"""Peacemaker. What a joke,"" and I hit my table when I heard that because the pun is too strong in this one."
0,"Oh, I thought this movie managed to make Amanda Wallwr hilarious. The perfect straight man. When the camera panned to her face after Peacemaker went ""What does he do, shoot polka dots?"" I lost it.  Or the way she stared down her employee when he didn't check to see if Weasel could swim."
0,What do you mean the first one was great
0,Nah the new film was woke trash.
0,um for me Suicide Squad is WAY better!
0,That guy going full bitch mode after seeing the slaughter made no sense.
0,The Suicide  Squad was the product of the best Weed and Acid known to man... Suicide Squad was a man on meth trying to write and direct at the same time... Not saying that Ayer never made anything good... But Gunn's better.

0,I hate how Hollywood has portrayed harley especially since her original design in the comics is just batman with jokers ideals.
0,These comparisons involving the Suicide Squad movies are really just unnecessary and fickle. Both movies are good in their own right. The first one had more of a serious tone whereas the second one had a more comedic heartfelt tone.
0,i am sorry i see your point but dont call king shark killer shark like come on
0,"I would die for King Shark 
He is so wholesome"
0,Do they succeed? Lol the second was trash. Only thing I liked was poka for man and the shark.. the first was good  it was a decent storyline and was the suicide squad.. the second one just threw away the first cast members or killed them easily... they should have continued it...
0,"Gonna be honest, you lost me when you said that the Snyder cut was an improvement of the original. The only thing it added was some cyborg stuff but the rest was worse and less consistent with the universe it is meant to be placed in...."

0,"Those were incredible times in the NBA.
I remember there was a saying at the time.
'I went to a fight, and a basketball game broke out'.
The competitive tension in the early 90's was so high, that player were constantly fighting.  And not only each other but on an occasion a fan or two.
It got so bad that the NBA adopted a zero tolerance policy on fighting.
Players were kicked out of games, and suspended for multiple games.
And that's when they increased the levels of fouls, and their punishments.
It was getting out if hand, but it was exciting to watch.
And it was disruptive to the game.
So they clearly needed to do something to curb the escalation between players.
MJ could take it and handle it.
And luckily for Pippen, Jordan was there to keep him calm.  Scotty was a hot head when pushed.

But Fun Times none the less."

Some nights they would not sign anything for us. The night Drazen was traded he stood there and signed for every person who asked him. It was great to watch. It wasn't until the next morning we learned he was traded. He really was a wonderful person.

0,"Guinness (and other beers) served on tap in the UK is pressurized with nitrogen and carbon dioxide, which in turn forms nitrous oxide. You ever spray a can of whipped cream into your mouth? Taste how when the whipped cream is gone but there is some sweet gas coming out? That sweet tasting gas is nitrous oxide. It's what makes Guinness have such a thick and creamy head, as opposed to artificially carbonated canned beer like Coors light or whatever. 
When you open the can of Guinness, the change in ambient pressure causes the ball to rupture, releasing the nitrogen into the beer which already contains the carbon dioxide. Voila! Just like it was poured from a tap in a pub.
Interesting side note; Guinness contains much less alcohol than other beers. If you want a beer with lunch (or before work), that's the one to choose.

It's like GI Joe used to say..."

They're also still using the 1950's playbook on what is/isn't racist. To their credit, their outdated understanding of racism means that SOME of them legitimately don't know how tone-deaf and hateful they sound."

These are all the same people who didn't show up to vote in their own state but then drove all the way to Washington DC on January 6th to stop the steal, lol!😃

  Ever notice how fox new turns off all comments when dealing with race? That's because even Fox news knows you are all a bunch racist and will leave racist comments. There is only one race and that's the human race. There are no racists in Heaven, its sad I have to say that.

1,"One of President Donald Trump’s lesser known but profoundly damaging legacies will be the explosive rise in the national debt that occurred on his watch. The financial burden that he’s inflicted on our government will wreak havoc for decades, saddling our kids and grandkids with debt.

The national debt has risen by almost $7.8 trillion during Trump’s time in office. That’s nearly twice as much as what Americans owe on student loans, car loans, credit cards and every other type of debt other than mortgages, combined, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It amounts to about $23,500 in new federal debt for every person in the country.

The growth in the annual deficit under Trump ranks as the third-biggest increase, relative to the size of the economy, of any U.S. presidential administration, according to a calculation by a leading Washington budget maven, Eugene Steuerle, co-founder of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. And unlike George W. Bush and Abraham Lincoln, who oversaw the larger relative increases in deficits, Trump did not launch two foreign conflicts or have to pay for a civil war.


Economists agree that we needed massive deficit spending during the COVID-19 crisis to ward off an economic cataclysm, but federal finances under Trump had become dire even before the pandemic. That happened even though the economy was booming and unemployment was at historically low levels. By the Trump administration’s own description, the pre-pandemic national debt level was already a “crisis” and a “grave threat.”

The combination of Trump’s 2017 tax cut and the lack of any serious spending restraint helped both the deficit and the debt soar. So when the once-in-a-lifetime viral disaster slammed our country and we threw more than $3 trillion into COVID-19-related stimulus, there was no longer any margin for error.

Our national debt has reached immense levels relative to our economy, nearly as high as it was at the end of World War II. But unlike 75 years ago, the massive financial overhang from Medicare and Social Security will make it dramatically more difficult to dig ourselves out of the debt ditch.

Falling deeper into the red is the opposite of what Trump, the self-styled “King of Debt,” said would happen if he became president. In a March 31, 2016, interview with Bob Woodward and Robert Costa of The Washington Post, Trump said he could pay down the national debt, then about $19 trillion, “over a period of eight years” by renegotiating trade deals and spurring economic growth.

After he took office, Trump predicted that economic growth created by the 2017 tax cut, combined with the proceeds from the tariffs he imposed on a wide range of goods from numerous countries, would help eliminate the budget deficit and let the U.S. begin to pay down its debt. On July 27, 2018, he told Sean Hannity of Fox News: “We have $21 trillion in debt. When this [the 2017 tax cut] really kicks in, we’ll start paying off that debt like it’s water.”"
