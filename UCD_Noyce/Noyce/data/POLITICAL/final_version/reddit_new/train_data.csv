0,"But we got a game off them in 2016 so without kd, with 3 halftime leads you would expect them to get 1 game after getting swept the previous year. That series and the Pelicans dame gets no blame and it’s ridiculous. The Pelicans turned around and got swept by the warriors too so it wasn’t like they were even good"

1,">The same way it has helped the Chinese, by enticing the flow of capital into their country

Capital is enticed by profits and the Chinese allowed sweatshops to be ran in the country to make it sufficiently *enticing* to capital.

Are you suggesting that Cuba allows sweatshops too? And how is that different to any other capitalist country that *entices capitalists* that way and tells their workers to wait for wealth to trickle down? Plus, this isn't even targetted to foreign investment. 

>And as every Marx and Lenin have asserted and proved, its an unfortunate necessity to promote development in a world dominated by capital

They never did anything of the sort, Marx never really got into the details of a socialist economy as it was not a thing of his time and Lenin never claimed that state capitalism is the way to go. At most, he identified it as one production mode present in Russia and claimed it was preferable to others, like subsistence farming (for obvious reasons). And at all times that USSR practiced the New Economic Policy -not even a decade- they never claimed it was anything more than a temporary setback, unlike these 'socialisms with x characteristics' which try to present it as theory."

At the end of the day, while Simmons is a dud in the playoffs he has proven that with or without Embiid playing he can lead a regular team to a playoff spot (albeit Western conference is another story). The Kings are one of the few teams in the league where even just Ben bringing his old self is an upgrade for them. They’ve tried to patiently develop their young players before and that hasn’t worked, why not take a chance with Ben."

1,"If everyone was class conscious we would have no need of starting movements anymore. There’s a decades-old, extremely funded hegemony designed exclusively to create “useful idiots” for the capitalists — a “machine” that makes them believe them to be bourgeois instead of proletarian. 

But even if you somehow forced these people to sit down and study basic economic and sociological concepts, some would still hold to their beliefs and prejudices. They are beyond any reasoning and you can’t reasonably expect to convert every single imperialist, racist, chauvinist or sexist to socialism. 

That’s not to say you shouldn’t seek to spread socialist ideas and class awareness, but keep in mind the stubbornness you’re bound to face. Many workers in the first world have been systematically indoctrinated with the capitalist dogma, and healing that brainwashing is never something easy — sometimes, it’s impossible."

Rob's health issues are concerning, but he's a 23-year-old who can impact the game right now as a shot-blocker and rim-runner, and who has All-Defensive upside if he works on his discipline and core strength. Good passing vision for a big man, too, although his delivery is still a work in progress."

1,"I live in a country (Republic of Ireland) with a healthcare system more right wing than even the gutted contemporary NHS, and the US makes me feel like I live in a 1960s European social democracy. There are so many things which make me afraid to move to the US.

Many of us in Ireland point to the US and say 'We don't want that!'. Particularly anyone a bit progressive, the US is the most typical example of rapacious greed.

The architects of the current Irish health system were the Progressive Democrats, an ideologically neoliberal party in the 1990s/2000s who were a junior partner in a coalition with Fianna Fáil. They had the Minister for Health, who made major changes. She said they wanted Ireland to be 'closer to Boston than Berlin'.

But as someone suggested below, there's nothing unique about the people of the US here. This is merely what happens when the ruling class is particularly successful in dominating society and it can happen anywhere that happens."

1,">US didn't intervene in WW2, they were attacked by Japan and Germany declared war because of the Tripartite Pact. I do think it's better that the US was dragged in though as it brought a quicker end to Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan who were committing genocide, but they only entered after being attacked and against Germany it was the Soviets doing the heavy lifting by far. This is however the only US war I would have fought in if I was american and lived then. (But again, not a war the US entered for the right reasons or with the right intentions)

I could point out a ton of critiques for the neocon arguments about WW2 too. But like, you seem to agree it was a good war, even if it had bad intentions.

>Not read up on that one very well so can't really comment.

>Manuel Noriega was helped into power by the US to begin with, they only overthrew him because he tried to make his own decisions. Is Panama off better after his downfall? That I am less versed in. Willing to hear more on this.

I think so. It ended the cycle of military dictatorships in Panama. Again, for non-benevolent reasons. I think the USA just didn't want Panama to be able to control the canal themselves.

>This I would like to learn more about. I know the serbian army committed war crimes such as in Srebrenica but the US bombing of Serbia also killed many civilians. So is one war criminal better than the other?

To be clear, the USA didn't bomb Serbia here. You're thinking of the Kosovo War.

>I suppose so, but keep in mind pirates become pirates chiefly from economic insecurity and no other path forward, something which is the case due to exploitation of third world countries where the US is the main culprit. So this is more like the US suppressing an inconcenient side effect of problems they helped create.

Yeah, but it's still good. No?

>TL;DR A lot of these are responses to issues the US helped create, or the US entered with the wrong intentions. You may make a case that US intervention is in some cases preferable to x or y dictator, but I would say that leaves us looking in the wrong direction. The US will never overthrow a dictator for humanitarian reasons, only self interest, and after doing so will always attempt to solidify their influence on the people they ""liberated"".

Yeah I don't have a disagreement here. My take was never ""Sometimes the USA is good and we should support them!"" but more like ""sometimes US foreign policy leads to good things, but that still isn't a justification for imperialism""

Reading over it, this thread doesn't show a meltdown or screeching, but it's probably because this isn't really a surprise to anyone. The whole point of the alt-right as an ""organization"" is that they're decentralized, so while it's pretty clear that there was an event that was meant to take place on the 6th, it's not as if there's someone to point to and say ""this guy told me to break into the capitol building"".

That said, there's very compelling evidence that, to some people, this was very premeditated. Look at some of the things these people were wearing: t-shirts mentioning civil war, preparation with zip ties and maps of the building-- it's clear that there were some people who knew this would happen.

So to me, this is just confirmation that the FBI and the government don't really have a way to police anonymous and decentralized forums that breed violence, since it's damn near impossible to tell who's who and who's even serious. That is, the alt-right is super good at what they do."

If he doesn't make it as the long term #1, then Arsenal will have paid only around 24 mil - why is that incredibly different than other transfer fees for outfield players who haven't made the grade at the highest level? It's not like GK values are plummeting either, or such an outlier like the Kepa (release fee, but still holds true). Maybe they won't recoup that fee, but not a terrible price overall, especially after the initial quotes of 40+ million.

Conversely, if he's Arsenal's #1 for the next 10 years+, paying $30 million seems like a great deal, especially with the rumored stricter homegrown quotas and possible European registration changes. Think overall it's a really decent fee for a promising English GK, who has every chance of being England's #1 in the near future as well."

1,"I'm not there yet, but I am evolving. I was an economics major back when monetarism and libertarianism were popular. Indoctrinated from the Milton Friedman, Austrian economics viewpoint. My professors were all of the University of Chicago school monetarist ilk, except for one from Berkley who introduced me to the left, Keynesianism, etc. In most things, theoretically I sided with the capitalists, the Laffercurve proponents, etc., but when it came to actual real life, my heart was with the downtrodden. Anyway, over the years I have worked as an attorney championing the underprivileged, disabled, etc. At the same time, I leveraged what money I was making into properties becoming a Landlord so that I could retire. So my sympathies are with both sides really. Nevertheless, watching China lift millions out of poverty and spend their resources on protecting and lifting up their own people, while capitalist USA has spent their blood and treasure on going to war and exploitation and the creation of a huge Industrial-Military complex has caused me to rethink everything.  I am afraid the USA is on the verge of long-term stagnation or maybe even a civil war.  Time will tell. The future seems to belong to China."
1,"In creative writing, there's a saying: 'don't give the reader 4, give them 2+2.' This act of participation allows the individual to come to the conclusion on their own, which will solidify that feeling much stronger than if they were simply told something. People like feeling smart and figuring things out.

Taking that idea and applying it to politics, you will find better success at converting your friends if they come to understand why socialism is a good thing on their own.   


You can help with this by helping them understand why liberalism is more like conservatism than it is to socialism. Don't push it, and don't even mention socialism. Just point out whenever there is a clear failure of conservative liberal policy. Comment on the similarity to right-wingers, how they would have done the same if they were in power. Example: Joe Biden is not cancelling student loans and yet he has the power to do so. That's a very Trump-like move. You can do the same with imperialism and warmongering, universal healthcare, wages, etc, etc.

The key is to be subtle and to focus on how similar liberalism is to conservatism, not why socialism is better. They need to see why liberalism is worse. The more they see this, they more the alternative (socialism) will become appealing."

Of course, theory becomes purposeless if it is not connected with revolutionary practice, just as practice gropes in the dark if its path is not illumined by revolutionary theory. But theory can become a tremendous force in the working-class movement if it is built up in indissoluble connection with revolutionary practice; for theory, and theory alone, can give the movement confidence, the power of orientation, and an understanding of the inner relation of surrounding events; for it, and it alone, can help practice to realise not only how and in which direction classes are moving at the present time, but also how and in which direction they will move in the near future.

0,"There’s going to be a lot of talk about the price (even at 24+6 but that’s the economics of football now.

The day Chelsea laid out 72mil for Kepa, that’s the price. We can disagree and scream and shout, but look at the market now. The economics of football are skewed and keep going up. Like, this is the long term reality of the league now. 

Like, I’m sorry, there are maybe 2-3 100mil players in the world right now… like, truly 100mil plus. But City lays out 100mil for Grealish? Is he 100mil player no. Probability wise he’ll never be a 100mil player, but if that’s the price clubs are willing to and going to pay, he’ll be worth 100mil on paper. 

And that’s not even me saying Grealish is a bad player. He’s phenomenal, there’s just no world in which he’ll have 100mil worth of impact ever. These are just the prices clubs are willing to both set and pay.

I think, at some point, we need to do more separation in our own minds as to what a player is worth on the field vs what a club is willing to pay for them because that’s where we the finances in soccer are going. 

If City are willing to spend a price then that’s the price, and if you’re not willing to give that price City will. It just entirely offsets financial impact. These prices are absurd, but we need to catch up to them in our mind when talking about transfers.

The reality is, once you cross 25-30mil, the return on investment on players drops of drastically and economics becomes a bigger factor than on field impact. It just can’t be a proportionate link at such significant increases.

Edit: the moment “you say you can’t pay that but city/Man U/Chelsea will” becomes a viable argument, this disproportionately skews the economics of soccer transfers."

1,"I don’t think this is a matter of collapse as much as it is of obvious dissent within some party members and former sponsors. Beatriz Mejia, for example, is a right wing conspiracy theorist and reactionary who likely “sided” with Castillo out of sheer convenience and misguided perceptions regarding his alleged conservatism. She, simply put, was never a socialist nor a friend of socialists, and this new allegation of Cerrón being a marxist boogeyman manipulator falls right into her alley of baseless conspiracies. 

The same can be said for the “moderates”, a number of party members who will certainly oppose the more radicals reforms Castillo wants to implement (mostly in the social and economic sectors). It’s hardly surprising that these people do not look favorably at what they think is “radicalism”, because by definition a moderate is always fearful of the statu quo changing. 

So, in short, I don’t think the party is collapsing but rather shedding its non-socialist members. This always and invariably happens with “united front” parties, like Podemos in Spain, or even with center-left parties like MORENA in Mexico."

1,"We propose as an alternative system: Socialism!

Let us just imagine that the number you stated is correct and capitalism has reduced global poverty over the last 20 years (I do not believe this but I guess neither of us seems to have concrete numbers or proof at the moment).
Capitalism has been in place for well more rhan 200 years. If it has reduced poverty in 20 years than that is less than 10% of its lifespan.
Socialism in itself is based around the idea of creating social equality so as to effectively eliminate poverty. While not every socialist country has achieved that goal, many of them are closer to it than the capitalist system is.
Remember here that in global capitalism comparing single countries is not good practice since the consuming countries and the producing countries act as a unit, dependent on each other.

Capitalism as an ideology relies on an uneven wealth distribution which is required for progress.
That inequality is systemic and inevitably leads to poverty if not properly regulated. Other principles of capitalism prevent such regulations though and that ties capitalism to the continuing existence of extreme poverty in this world.

We do not claim to be able to fully eradicate poverty but we would be actively and effectively working to combat it.

But besides poverty and otherwise social injustice capitalism also is environmentally unsustainable and hence there are more reasons to substitute it with something. For example some form of socialism"

1,"Prior to 9/11 the US was trying to work with the previous government but it wasn’t convenient for them and became somewhat of a hinderance or annoyance because the government didn’t want the industrialization and mineral / oil extraction that the US was proposing. Americans had no issue with working with radical Islamists when it meant they could potentially get money out of it in the form of minerals. When 9/11 occurred the Taliban denounced the actions of Al-Queda and offered the US assistance if Osama Bin Laden would be allowed a trial in a Muslim country. The US denied help and since their relationship was inconvenient for them they declared war on Afghanistan under the pretext that the Taliban was assisting Al Queda since they once offered Osama Bin Laden guest status when coming to their country. The US then invaded and established a puppet government.

The US politicians have never cared about radical Islam, it’s why they are now seeking diplomatic options with the Taliban. A majority of US politicians have very fluid and sometimes non existent morals."

0,"Ah, the usual thread about how mediocre the Pacers are. That's no shade at you OP, that's just where these things always go. 

Since Jordan retired, the Pacers actually lead the Central Division in wins, playoff appearances and all-stars. Without tanking (fans in Indiana would never tolerate a basketball team tanking), there have been three completely different versions of the team in that time that have had legit championship windows. How many ""small"" market teams can say that? If one of them works out, their thought of completely differently. Winning championships are hard.

The Pacers have been snake bit by injuries the last couple of years and have had coaching issues. Nate got tuned out, then new Nate thought he was Pop or something. Drafting has also been a problem. 

I actually like the fact the Pacers are being discounted right now. There is bound to be improvement just by the fact Carlisle can actually coach both sides of the ball. Drafting seems to have not completely sucked this year. I think taking a finished product like Duarte will lead to Brogdan and/or Warren getting traded.

1,"I think a majority of Reddit users are a lot younger than someone that would frequent subreddits like r/Conservatives.  Their minds are still developing and they don't have enough life experience so they just parrot what the hear on campus or CNN.  I'm 44 so there was no Reddit or social media back in my day but I am a southerner and my entire family votes Republican because to them Democrats might as well be the devil.  I didn't understand at the time and promised myself ""I will never blindly vote for one party just because I am **supposed** to hate the other party.  I will vote for who has the best policy that I agree with.""  And THEN I grew up!  I got a job and lived by the motto *Hard Work Pays Off*.  Then I started to see people on my team getting hired so the company could meet their quota.  Then a few of those quota people, which I trained and mentored, were promoted because of the quota.  This is when I started to pay more attention to policy.  I stopped paying attention to the media and soundbites and started to do deeper dives.  Reading bills, paying attention to local politics as well.  The more of **MY TIME** that I invested into researching and educating myself on policies, I then realized why my family voted all Republican no matter what.  Of course there are things I still don't agree with from the Republican side, but there is no way in hell I could agree to any of the crap these liberals are pushing nowadays.  In the past three years, they just ran off the road with their crap and I honestly don't get how anyone could support them.  But I do think that's why Reddit is such a liberal mess.  The problem today is that Reddit and the internet in general will just perpetuate their ignorance by living in an echo chamber.  They will only surround themselves with members of the hive mind and never get to the point where they start to question ""what's really going on?"""

1,"Fortunately or unfortunately, the odds are pretty against us ALL dying (unless the upcoming water wars devolve into full nuclear apocalypse).  


Climate catastrophe won't render the planet completely uninhabitable to humanity. It will just make civilization as we currently recognize it, with its huge populated cities, completely unsustainable. Aside from the rising sea levels and uptick in storm frequency smashing coastlines, the shifting patterns of rainfall and aridity will cause widespread droughts and food shortages. Spikes in civil unrest and resources wars will create waves of refugees, which will probably inflame existing xenophobic attitudes as those in charge continue to redirect unrest at worsening conditions towards scapegoats and we see fascism and authoritarianism continue to rise. Eventually, we see a mass die off from a mix of starvation, warring over water and arable land, internal conflicts such as civil wars and ethnic cleansing, and resources become so tight that large scale nations as we know them can't be maintained and collapse. They fracture into smaller regional powers or city states. Humanity still exists, but as scattered isolated pockets and at greatly reduced numbers. Picking through the ruins of the old civilization. Maybe even a few of them might turn out to be small anarchistic communes, but likely it'll mostly be small scale despotism by local warlords and neo-feudalism.  


The real question is how much knowledge gets lost during that societal collapse and mass die off. Of the doctors, scientists, engineers, and all the people who actually know how all our current technology functions, how many survive and are able to pass on their knowledge in sufficient numbers to the next generation, particularly without the infrastructure of large scale university systems and the internet probably not being maintained anymore. If there's  enough collective expertise and functional infrastructure to keep manufacturing solar panels, antibiotics, etc. Or if we're stuck scavenging the refuse. Exactly how far back this dark age is going to take us.   


TLDR: We don't all just die. Most of us die, and the rest of us get to live Mad Max."

My sister owned the Wii, and we’d play MarioKart, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Skylanders or even just Wii Sports/fitness for hours.  I had the PS3, and being around for prime COD days (MW2-BO2 imo), Saints Row 2-3, GTA IV, Assassins Creed 3 was amazing.  A whole group of us in 6-8th grade would play Nuketown 24/7 and dominate in demolition, showing off our golden Famas’s or AK47s.  We also played Minecraft on our laptops as laggy as it was, but nothing compares to that first year of playing it.  When I try to play MC now even though there’s more to do I just can’t get as invested anymore.  Same with some of the other games mentioned above.

1,"Did you agree with Obama 100%? How about Clinton’s policies? Do you agree with 100% of what Biden is doing?

The reason you’re not getting an honest answer (and why I’m silly for providing one) is because you’re not trying to be up front. You’re trying to get a “gotcha” moment, or hope you catch someone go, “huh, yea I need to reevaluate *all* of my beliefs based on one situation!” Which the left loves to do, try and catch people in “hypocrisy” when they peddle in it quite often. 

The answer to your question is I don’t support it, and I think it’s a very bad take. It was also a knee-jerk reaction to the Parkland shooting, a situation that could have been avoided by the police acting on one of their 30-something calls to the shooters home. Or if the FBI followed up on any of the calls they got regarding the kid as a potential threat. Or if the Sheriffs on the scene had nutted up, grown a fucking pair and tried to stop him. Instead they chose to sit back and listen to kids get gunned down. 

To give you an answer you didn’t ask for, more gun laws won’t solve anything. The AR-15 is *not a weapon of war*. Most gun laws are infringements which are unconstitutional and should be repealed and the ATF should be abolished, along with most other federal agencies. 

Now to ask you a question, how do you feel about Biden’s statement of needing F15’s and nukes to take on the government, just to have the Taliban take everything over with nary a whimper?"

1,"Joe Biden's handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal was condemned as ""catastrophic"" and ""shameful"" on Wednesday as the Houses of Parliament delivered an unprecedented rebuke to a US president.

MPs and peers from across the political spectrum, including Boris Johnson, put some blame for the Taliban's takeover and the chaos that followed on Britain's closest ally.

Mr Biden was accused of ""throwing us and everybody else to the fire"" by pulling out US troops, and was called ""dishonourable"" for criticising Afghan forces for not having the will to fight.

Former defence chiefs who led British troops in the Middle East were among those to speak out, while there were warnings that the West's withdrawal would embolden Russia and China.

The interventions mark a deterioration in UK-US relations almost exactly 20 years after Britain joined America in invading Afghanistan to root out terrorism after the September 11 attacks. 

But it was not just Mr Biden who faced criticism, with Mr Johnson and his ministers told they had overseen the worst disaster in British foreign policy for 65 years.

The Prime Minister was accused of not doing enough to rally allies to support Afghanistan as the US departure became apparent, including by his predecessor, Theresa May.

Placeholder image for youtube video: jDPXSrOIzr0
Wednesday's debate marked the first time Parliament has sat as normal in more than a year, as MPs and peers crammed into the chambers with Covid social distancing rules gone. 

Mr Johnson began by arguing that America's decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan had forced Britain's hand, saying it was an ""illusion"" to think other allies wanted to step in to keep the peace. 

""The West could not continue this US-led mission – a mission conceived and executed in support and defence of America – without American logistics, without US air power and without American might,"" the Prime Minister said in a clear swipe at Washington.

MPs from all sides of the Commons were forceful in their criticism. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said: ""The US is, of course, an important ally, but to overlook the fighting of the Afghan troops and forces, and the fact that they have been at the forefront of that fighting in recent years, is wrong.""

Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: ""The American decision to withdraw was not just a mistake – it was an avoidable mistake, from President Trump's flawed deal with the Taliban to President Biden's decision to proceed, and to proceed in such a disastrous way.""

Tom Tugendhat, the Tory chairman of the foreign affairs committee, who fought alongside Afghans as a British soldier, called out Mr Biden's criticism of the Afghan army.

""To see their commander in chief call into question the courage of men I fought with, to claim that they ran, is shameful,"" he said, to murmurs of approval from other MPs.

Placeholder image for youtube video: ktxCt2114_I
Labour MP Chris Bryant called Mr Biden's remarks about Afghan soldiers ""some of the most shameful comments ever from an American president"".

Khalid Mahmood, a Labour MP and former defence minister, said: ""The Biden government have just come in and, without looking at what is happening on the ground, have taken a unilateral decision, throwing us and everybody else to the fire.""

Other MPs who served as soldiers also rounded on Mr Biden. Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader, called his comments ""shameful"", while Labour MP Dan Jarvis described them as ""particularly distasteful and dishonouring"". Tobias Ellwood, a former veterans' minister, said the US withdrawal was ""absolutely the wrong call"".

Leading Conservatives in the Lords also made clear their disapproval. Lord Hammond, a former foreign secretary, said: ""When I listen to the US president, I cannot help reaching the conclusion that this decision was made out of a sense of political tidy-mindedness – we need to close a file; we need to draw a line; it has gone on for too long.""

Lord Howard, another former Tory leader, said Mr Biden's withdrawal ""is, and will be seen by history as, a catastrophic mistake which may well prove to be the defining legacy of his presidency"".

The heated rhetoric has thrust the state of the ""special relationship"" and the Biden-Johnson partnership into the spotlight. The Telegraph understands Mr Johnson had been attempting to get Mr Biden on the phone to discuss Kabul falling from Monday morning. The pair eventually talked at close to 10pm on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, General Sir Nick Carter, the head of the Armed Forces, accused the US of ""shattering"" the morale of Afghan troops when they stopped air strikes. 

A UK defence source insisted the UK and US military were continuing to work closely at Kabul airport in a race against time under way to evacuate people with the Taliban nearby. However, there is concern amongst some in government that the US might soon pull out of the airport, according to Whitehall sources. 

Philip Reeker, America's acting ambassador, went into Downing Street for talks with Will Gelling, Mr Johnson's foreign policy adviser.

While the day of debate was playing out in Westminster after Parliament was recalled from its summer recess, the Taliban was tightening its grip on Afghanistan. Militants shot dead at least three people after protesters pulled down the group's banner and raised the Afghan national flag in its place.

Placeholder image for youtube video: Ou4eXGdtpEA
The Taliban was also tightly controlling which Afghans could enter Kabul airport to escape, leading to footage of girls locked out and begging to be helped by Western forces.

Senior former UK defence figures criticised Mr Biden, with Lord Dannatt, the former head of the British Army, saying: ""The manner and timing of the Afghan collapse is the direct result of President Biden's decision to withdraw all US forces from Afghanistan by the 20th anniversary of 9/11.

""At a stroke, he has undermined the patient and painstaking work of the last five, 10, 15 years to build up governance in Afghanistan, develop its economy, transform its civil society and build up its security forces. The people had a glimpse of a better life – but that has been torn away.""

Lord Houghton of Richmond, a former chief of the defence staff, said: ""I think the American decision to withdraw military support was a dreadful one, and the resulting chaos should be of no surprise.""

Mr Johnson came in for repeated criticism for his handling of the Afghanistan withdrawl, including by Mrs May.

She said: ""In July of this year, both President Biden and my Right Honourable friend the Prime Minister indicated that they did not think that the Taliban were ready or able to take over control of the country.


""Was our intelligence really so poor? Was our understanding of the Afghan government so weak? Was our knowledge of the position on the ground so inadequate? Did we really believe that, or did we just feel that we had to follow the United States and hope that, on a wing and a prayer, it would be all right on the night?

""We boast about global Britain, but where is global Britain on the streets of Kabul? A successful foreign policy strategy will be judged by our deeds, not by our words.""

Mr Johnson talked to Mario Draghi, the Italian prime minister, on Wednesday as he pushed world leaders for a unified position on the new Taliban regime. Foreign ministers from the G7 group of nations will hold talks on Afghanistan on Thursday.

The UK had evacuated around 1,200 people from Kabul on military flights as of Wednesday morning. Around 300 were UK nationals and 900 were Afghans and others who had helped the UK's mission in the country."

I was against it at first too, but to be honest he seems like an absolutly amazing talent and with Odegaard secured i cant be happier with this transfer. And with Leno unwilling to sign a new contract it seems.like a very Smart move. Hope Aaron competes and wins the starting spot by the end of the season.

The NFL GOAT is probably the most contested tbh. It also doesn’t work the same way that the NBA goat debate works, because the natures of the game are different. Rice can be most people’s GOAT without having won a single MVP (he was robbed of one though). A guy like Jim Brown or Barry Sanders with careers shorter than a decade can have an argument against Rice and Brady’s 20+ year careers. Dan Marino can be some peoples choice without having won a super bowl. Things are a lot more abstract when ranking football players because of the smaller sample size. Jim brown played 118 games in his career, Lebron nearly plays that many games in a single season."

1,"Charity is at best toothless and unhelpful, and at worst, a money laundering scheme. It doesn't address the systemic issues that cause poverty, and so doesn't solve the problem, it's given as a way of creating positive PR for the entity donating, and it's done for the purpose of tax a write off, thereby making it a donation in their name but paid out by the very poor and working people it's supposed to benefit. That's if any of the money actually makes it to those that it's supposed to benefit. Often times most, or even all, of the money ends up in the hands of those few individuals at the top of the charity organization, look it up, these people are crooks making millions in the name of charity. 

Finally one must ask themselves: why it is deemed necessary to give the millionaires and billionaires all of the money to donate in the first place? The charity money is given to those that don't make enough money to support themselves in one way or another, regardless of whether they are working and regardless of whether they even can work. Wouldn't it make more sense for those people to be paid enough for their labor to support themselves instead of funnelling the money to those at the top in the hopes they give to charity? Or better yet, use that money to create a society that meets the needs of all regardless of their labor; it's a workable idea.

 No more billionaires, no more billion dollar corporations, no more trillions spent on war, funnel that money into a social safety net and into the paychecks of those that actually produce the wealth, those that can't, and those that enrich us in ways that capitalism refuses acknowledge."

0,"That doesn't really mean anything. As a normal, fairly unathletic guy, I would much rather have Jrue's defense that Jokic's BBIQ. BBIQ, even one as great as Jokic, doesn't really mean anything unless it's paired with other things, such as size, technique, ability to put pressure on the defense with your scoring, etc. Even players that have great BBIQ (even if it's not as great as Jokic) and a buch of other basketball skills struggle to be starters in the NBA, like Rubio.

On the other hand, if you magically get Jrue's defense, you would at least be a rotation player in the NBA. Mostly because defense is actually a buch of skills together.

That doesn't mean that Jrue is better, or that his defense is better than Jokic BBIQ (it's not). It just means it's a more useful skill by itself."

1,"Hmmm, I feel WSWS can be dogmatically anti-union, which is extremely frustrating, but at the same time they cover a lot of failures of unions I don't see elsewhere.  They just take it to the extreme, in a way that kind of undermines organized labor, and makes it hard to parse how much is warranted union compromising and how much is actual union ineptitude.  But I think if presented with these disclaimers, it's fairly good journalism.  They cover a lot of topics from a Socialist perspective that I don't otherwise find, and while their dogmatic commitment to pigeonhole every article into ""workers should form rank and file committees"" is sometimes borderline comical, I believe the analysis can be informative.

This is to say, I believe WSWS has much higher integrity than say, the Grayzone, but their extreme dogmatism can make their takes undermining on their own.

Beyond this, one of my main criticisms is they don't include direct link citations, like say Jacobin (I'm sure they'd hate that comparison lol).  If you're going to be on the extreme left, it really helps to have direct sources to back your claim up.  For example, I've seen them post about angry union members on a Facebook page mad at the union pushing a bad deal  - but they don't include links or even screenshots to validate these claims.  I've emailed them before about it and got no reply"

1,"Here's what I remember:

For a long time, Afghanistan was controlled by a corrupt monarchy that could not implement reforms. It received financial aid from the U.S. and military aid from the Soviet Union.

During the 1970s, the military took over, formed a left-leaning gov't, and tried to industrialize but received little support from the public because it was suspected to be communist. Another coup took place, which led to moderate reform but failed when it was considered as pro-Soviet.

The U.S. took advantage of this, arming and funding Islamic fundamentalists from the Middle East who supported the Afghan rebels. In time, the Soviets withdrew, and after that the socialist gov't fell apart.

Groups stemming from the rebels took over, esp. the Taliban, or ""students."" After 9/11, the U.S. saw another opportunity to take control of the region, arguing that terrorists based in Afghanistan and elsewhere were responsible, and invaded.

They stayed for around two decades, backing a U.S.-puppet gov't that eventually fell apart when they withdrew. The original withdrawal plan from Janualy involved shared control of the country with the Taliban. That is, the puppet regime would be replaced by the Taliban but U.S. troops would remain until May.

This was not followed as the U.S. began to leave quickly given an August deadline, and the Taliban have taken over."

Look at the top 10 countries in that list. If the USSR was socialist and its problems are to be blamed on socialism, then why should we not consider Chad, Timor-Leste, Madagascar, Haiti, Mozambique, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Lesotho, Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Rwanda as exemplars of capitalism?

Let's ignore the history of imperialism too, because defenders of capitalism like to ignore history and pretend that imperialism doesn't exist. So let's just take those countries as individual cases.

Almost all countries today describe themselves as capitalist and are described as capitalist or could be accurately described as capitalist. Yet most people on the planet live in grinding poverty. What is the excuse there?

Bringing people out of poverty, well most of that was actually socialist China. Oh not a fair comparison, those countries as so backwards, they haven't developed yet!

What do you think about the USSR then? Which was a 90% peasant, mostly feudal monarchy before the 1917 Revolution, then had to more or less single-handedly defeat the German army in WW2, lost 20 million soldiers (1/3 of the population of modern Britain), and still made it to space before the richest country on the planet (USA).

And I'm very critical of the USSR and Leninism.

The worst thing you could say is that socialism creates starvation by accident. But capitalism creates it on purpose (World Bank, etc).

And if capitalism worked, there would be no communists."

They were on the run, unable to meet, unable to plan, unable to launch any attacks. **Obama** allowed that tiny group of survivors to become ISIS and establish a Caliphate that threatened the entire middle east. **Obama** dropped pallets of cash on a runway and helped the world's leading sponsor of terrorism spread their evil oppression throughout Africa and the middle east. **Trump** destroyed ISIS and the Caliphate, brought Iran to its knees, had the Taliban cowering in their mountains, afraid of just 2,500 US troops. **Biden** allowed Iran to stand up and regain its title as the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. **Biden** gave Afghanistan back to the Taliban.

Failed nation building? Under US protection, Afghanistan established an elected government, made access to electricity almost universal, increased education 10 fold, doubled its literacy rate, and increased education for girls from nothing to almost 40% of the school population.

1,"TLDR: Gay boy, Conservative family, public libraries. The rest is history ✊

I am leaving out the issues that have been eye opening for me (struggling to pay rent, minimum wage, systemic racism, the wealth disparity, corporate greed and the effects of it, climate change, sensationalized media, corrupt politicians, lobbying, etc…) Rather, this is the situation that set me on my path.

I was raised in very conservative small town Texas by your run-of-the-mill republican fundamentalist Christian family. I knew I was gay by 13 and when I told my parents I was sent to conversion therapy. As a way to save myself I lied and said the therapy worked. In an effort to distract myself and seem worthy to my parents, I threw myself into conservative politics and religious apologetics. This was an extremely hopeless time for me. I still battle the mental disturbances this therapy has cursed me with. At 17 I checked out the communist manifesto from the library (without really knowing what it was or what it was about). I knew communism was bad but I’ve never read something that I agreed with on such a primal level. Just compassion and logic (I am talking about socialist and communist theory, not authoritative socialism or communism in practice ie. Soviet Union, Moa-ism, etc.) As I grew up I became more liberal and began voting democrat (only two elections so far lol) As someone who was steadily falling down the Alt-Right pipeline, this was a big deal for me. Eventually (especially within the past 2 years) I became “radicalized.” I guess you could say I switch pipelines from alt right to radical left but I would argue that they are very very very different creatures. As a 23 year old college student who now lives states away from my toxic family, I can say I am 100% a leftist socialist. My ideas on many things evolve and change as time moves. I wouldn’t recognize myself 6 years ago, I wouldn’t recognize myself 2 years ago! I believe keeping your mind open and listening to those with no voice is most important when making these personal ideological decisions. I don’t know who or where I’ll be in 5 years but I know that compassion and justice should be at the heart of legislation. For me at this point in my adult life, socialism is the answer to all the issues our world and country are facing. I hope to use my degrees after graduating to advocate and push for these ideals anywhere and anyway I can. Socialism has blessed me with new hope for the future of humanity, the planet, and myself.
Sorry if this sounds preachy!!! I am just extremely passionate about this topic."
1,">How do libs do it?

Money. These women are bought off."
1,"This is not correct..

If you are a basic worker with no set timeline/Guaranteed contract then they 100% can say that now. See below:

Before you apply for benefits, you must meet three requirements. These requirements include: being able, available and actively searching for work; that you lost your job through no fault of your own; and that you earned enough wages during your base period to qualify for payments.

By offering ways for employees to not be vaccinated like filing exemptions, they put the ""no fault of your own"" on to the employee.

The employer added new guidelines and requirements for employment. They have multiple options to hit this requirement. If they dont meet these, they have left by their own fault."

Other than that, kabul is quite normal. I can't tell you about the countryside tho, because there is a massive disinformation campaign right now. Everyone is sharing everything and spreading all kinds of rumors, which is causing more chaos in Afghanistan.

1,"Thank you for laying it out so clearly! I had never considered a system like that.

(3) how would we be able to know if there are too few or too many of a certain type of building in an area efficiently without a market giving indications? (4) how would you decide how many resources to allocate to the construction of a building and who would provide those resources (5) what if there are too many or too few architects, builders etc. (6) if the democratically built building was residential, who would get to live there? (7) do a significant proportion of the population have an interest in or time available to participating in these decisions and if not - can it really be said to be democratic?"

1,"There are some who would say that the unemployed still constitute workers as they still perform a number of social labour functions.

I think society is still fairly stratified - the gulf between someone in marketing and someone working a underpaid job in the service industry is fairly large in terms of income and social standing and class dynamics do still exist in America (I'm Scottish, so this is just outside observation). Hell, even within oppressed groups such as the disabled socioeconomic class markers exist beyond work title, cultural and social expectations as well as income can vastly differ, disability - much like the unemployed and general workers is in no way a monolith.

Demonisation is also not the same as prejudice - I can have a prejudice about a certain occupation and it's expected norms (say bankers) but can overcome it when given evidence. Demonisation is more having a stuck stereotype that is unable to be changed - I think yeah, there should be less demonisation and othering, but having preconcieved ideas about specific jobs based on the observed class composition isn't entirely without merit.

Yes, there's no ethical employment under captialism - but there's a difference between having to scrap together a pittance at a terrible job and knowing that if your job in marketing fails then you have savings or family to back you up. Not in ethics necessarily, but in exploitation both historic and contemporary."

When it comes to something like measles, I'm not sure why that virus doesn't mutate into something else that would require a new vaccine.  I mean, presumably it is mutating, as there is always a chance for mutation during replication, but perhaps however it mutates, it either becomes ineffectual (non-contagious / can't infect anyone) or is still able to be targeted by the current vaccine.  Coronavirus and something like measles are entirely different viruses that have different mechanisms of action.  I'm no virology expert, so I don't know what those are, but I suspect those differences are important here."

1,">There is the minor detail that primitive capitalism is unproductive. Hence why capital becomes bigger and bigger and 'companies of one person' become a rarity.

You are correct. Primitive capitalism doesn't scale **but** works well for family restaurants and other very small businesses that only employ direct family members. ""Everything else needs to be a worker-owned cooperative like Mondragon Corporation of Spain. Workers pick the managers (and on up to the CEO) and the workers get a share of the profits. Prof. Wolff is big on worker-owned cooperatives.""

>So what you're saying leads to extreme poverty which is why socialist countries that did allow this, very quickly moved on to allow employment of more people. Like Cuba now.

From the end of the war in 1975 to Đổi Mới (""Renovation/Innovation"") in 1986 Viet Nam was a strict central command economy that didn't work well. Street food was driven underground after being a regular part of life for hundreds of years. It was once also a regular part of life in the US until most of it was made illegal in the 1950's but I digress. Viet Nam allowed the return of street food and small shops because they realized people did better trading with each other than a central command economy running every detail. Think of it as anarcho-socialism on the micro level and more central influence the larger a business gets. Adam Smith said the butcher, baker and brewer would all act in their own self interest to stay in business. An idea that works on a very small scale but totally fails when a company becomes large. Instead of a central command economy I like worker-owned cooperatives as an answer to public/private companies acting against the best interests of their workers and their customers.

I understand that white male socialists can be passionate, well-informed, capable leaders who just want their chance to maximally contribute to the revolution.  I try to be such a person, myself.  Everyone is entitled to speak their own truth.  But personal ambitions and entitlements must take a backseat to the revolution, itself.  And if we do not persuade the primary victims of capitalism (women and people of color) that they will have a better deal under socialism, and not just more of the colonialist condescension that they've become sadly accustomed to, we have no hope of success.  They've been hearing from white cismen all their lives.  They already know so much more about us than we know about them.  It's time we white cismen sit down, keep silent, listen to the voices of the oppressed, and learn.

1,"I strongly suggest watching [Dropping the Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCRTgtpC-Go). An American invasion of the Japanese mainland wasn't even seriously considered by the time 1945 rolled around, not because of the bombs, but because *it already wasn't necessary anyways*. Japan had already lost the war and it had completely lost its ability to stop the firebombings and naval blockade. The US alternative was to just stay the course and not lose any of its own troops because it could decimate Japan from the air and sea with absolutely no resistance. It's ludicrous to talk about a deadly land invasion as the alternative to dropping the bombs in light of all this, as well as because the US knew Japan was trying to find a way to surrender anyways and both countries just needed to find the right wording to each other to make it happen.

> What role does economic system play in all this? None.

Absolute libshit to think socialists should only care about the economic side of things and it's even more ridiculous that you're complaining about this post being in this sub when you make a comment like that. Successful socialist movements are as much a social endeavor as they are economic, and pointing out the gross injustices of capitalist imperialism is a part of that. It is even possible draw the line between the gross imperialist disregard for life and display of force and the capitalist motives to do so, if it would satisfy your desire for everything to relate everything back solely to economics in some way."
1,"Slight grumble, but it irks me a little bit when people describe having a sore arm post-COVID vaccine as a ""COVID vaccine side effect"". It's not a COVID vaccine side effect, it's just a consequence of having an injection in your arm that occurs with any vaccine.

I get the flu jab every year for work, and it's exactly the same. It's not some sort of special COVID thing."

1,"Of course the situation is unstable and worsening, but you can't just spark outrage in the streets. Every time a tiny grouping, or usually just a single person has called for revolution or a general strike, nothing has happened.

The consciousness of the masses is moved by great events, at least until you get a widely respected leadership. The challenge is getting that leadership (which needs to consist of a few thousand members, at a minimum), and maintaining its political level.

You asked for organisations, and you mentioned Texas, so I'd recommend [Socialist Revolution.](https://socialistrevolution.org)"

0,"Hard to tell.

We still look shaky playing out from the back when pressed, we rely too much on crosses and almost never play through the center, we are getting caught on counters easily and we lack an overall mojo when we play. It certainly hasn't helped that Auba's form fell off a cliff, Partey constantly being injured and our RB position being a game of musical chairs.

But that's the thing about great managers - they adapt and overcome. Arteta may not have the exaaact players for his style of play, but he has been backed enough this window imo to get us a Top 6 finish. 

His goodwill of winning the FA cup has run dry now. Our board has been very clear in that they have no intention of sacking him, but that may change now that there are fans and that they've spent a lot.

1,"You got blood money on your hands. I wonder what's worse. PSG, City and consorts are artificial constructs. Yes, there might have been a club with history some time ago, but with the influx of criminal billionaires and countries, this shit ain't worth squat. You're a brand now, not a football club. You got no soul. Wankers running around in air jordan (jesus fuck) psg shirts, not knowing shit about anything psg, because it's become ""fashion"". It's sad. You're the cancer destroying this game, and the governmental bodies are trying to fill their coffers equally, instead of steering against this development. And everyone not playing this money game is suffering. 

Clubs can't even develop their own talent anymore. Kids are being lured from a young age for little money, and sometimes mockingly loaned back to them again. So the club will never make a proper profit off the inevitable. Or they end up in a loan army, where the rich entities are waiting for them to raise their value, to sell them with a profit again a couple of years later. 

Everything for profit. Trophies aren't a must anymore, just a means to create even more money. PSG has only won domestic titles in a b-tier league (sorry Frenchmen), but is somehow one of the most valuable football entities in the world. Because they're (financially) doped heavier than the Russian olympic cadre.

What that creates is a large group of young leftist wasting their time and they end up believe that being a good leftist is just consuming the right things. They watch leftist therefore they are leftist. It diverts their distaste for capitalism back into capitalist consumption.

This is not to say you’re a bad person for watching streamers or listening to podcasts, but socialism is struggle not consumption. You need to go outside, join groups, and help people not just sit around and watch the right content."

Then we have this. A man in very obvious rapid decline. They are clearly hiding him and won't let him take questions because that would be an even bigger disaster. A live press conference can't be edited like this piece was. ABC is trying to cover for him and even then, they couldn't really cover.

And here we go, the tired ass ""bububut FOX NEWS!"" You can crawl back to r/politics with that nonsense.

It IS Biden's fault because a deal was struck with the Taliban for an orderly withdrawal. Biden decided to scrap that plan, rather than use the time he had in order with evacuate the civilians, evacuate the Afghanis that worked closely with the US and would certainly be executed as soon as the Taliban got their hands on them, and then pull out the military.

Instead he waited until the Taliban came roaring in and then made a hasty retreat, leaving behind over 11,000 non military Americans and god knows how many Afghanis who had helped us over 20 years who are now doomed to be executed once they're hunted down by the Taliban.

1,"Funny, my step-dad introduced me to Socialism and Communism...But he was against it!

He used to work for Radio Free Europe back in the 80's and he would visit Moscow often. When he started becoming my step-dad in December 2000, he actually taught me a lot about the USSR and got me really interested with the Eastern Bloc. 

He's an old school US imperialist but, never once, he wished for it to be destroyed completely, but to complement the USA's capitalistic system. If I'm not being clear, my step-dad saw communism as the necessary super-villain that needed to be defeated in ""battles"" but not completely destroyed. 

4 years later I moved to the UAE and spent 6 years of my life there, far away from the US educational system. I discovered The Coup in 2006 and they introduced Socialism/Communism to me in a more honest point-of-view.

I moved back to the states in 2011 for college. For a few years, I identified as a libertarian because the US government is the most malevolent entity in existence and I felt shrinking it to the point that corruption is no longer able to be rampant, would have brought positive change. 

But, after all that, being on my own and trying to support myself while in college started pushing me more and more left. 

I remember being mesmerized by Bernie Sanders and saw this whole new perspective on left wing politics. I grew up to believe that the democrats wanted socialism and the republicans wanted to ""save america"" from it and all that from my step-dad.

&#x200B;

Now I believe they're both neoliberal corporate pawns and I've grown exhausted seeing every still have that idiotic belief that each of their political parties will bring any change. 

I'm coming to terms that you don't need to shrink the government to stop evil and bring positive changes. I'm really warming up to Socialism for the first time."

It includes the political theories and movements associated with such systems. Social ownership can be public, collective, cooperative, or of equity.

0,"I actually think Carlisle can turn around the team similar to his first years when he coached the Pistons & Pacers. Before Carlisle got to the Pacers in 2003, they had a ton of talent that was being held back by bad coaching with Isaiah Thomas as coach. Not saying that the Pacers will be the number one seed like they were in his first season with the Pacers, but on paper I don't see why they can't be the 4th or 5th seed with Carlisle's coaching come playoff time being a good edge to have, with the ability to get even better imo. 

People are sleeping on the Pacers and don't know the impact Carlisle has on teams. He turned the Pistons that should have been bad after Grant Hill left town and turned them into the 2 seed in his first season with Jerry Stackhouse as his best player. Turned the Pacers from being underachievers once Bird retired from coaching into the number one seed in his first season. Turned the Mavericks who were considered choke artists and Dirk viewed as too soft to win as the best player on a title team into finally getting the Mav's over the hump to win it all in his 3rd year. I can see similar things happening with the Pacers imo, as Carlisle never underachievers with the talent he is given."

I eagerly await the day when when people will have the opportunity and choice to either gain senses or ableness they never had or restore that which they've lost from injury or disease, if they wish; and with recent medical technology breakthroughs, there's reason to be optimistic that day is coming soon. But it's disgraceful to me how we still have so many major organizations and everyday people who look at every physical disabled or neurodivergent person as though they're something that need to be ""fixed."" As though it's impossible that someone wouldn't prefer to stay the way they are rather then become more ""normal.""

It's a reminder of how everything in our world is filtered through the myopic lens of capitalist productivity, even subconsciously. People talk about needing to ""cure"" anything they deem wrong with others and justify it by saying that they'll ""be able to live a full life."" That's ignoring the fact that a blind, or deaf, or autistic person is no less capable of living a life full of meaning and enjoyment...

'Color blindness' is not possible, nor would it solve anything. Capital creates divisions within the working class to keep us from overthrowing them. Youre right in that these divisions do not stem from anything inherent, we all are in a certain sense the same. But the divisions have been made, ignoring the problem does not make it go away, we need to bridge the gap and stand in solidarity with each other. 

Saying 'black and brown ppl, women, lgbt ppl etc, experience oppression and we should recognize that and fight it' is not saying 'lets oppress white ppl'

He's getting something (rent profit) without performing any labor to earn it. The tenants work and then have to give him a sizable percentage of the income they earned for the privilege of having someplace to live. Instead of those privately held assets being used to turn a privately held profit by exploring people who do actual work, those same assets could be publicly owned and used to further the public good. You know, the basic foundation of socialism."

1,"Thank you for your long message. I totally understand what you mean because I agree with you. 
Even if you don't seem to see it, my poster is about that, the slogan ""Compost the rich"" is about that. The message is simplified (it's a slogan and not a leaflet or an extract from a theory) but we are questioning a complete system. ""Compost the rich"" clearly implies that it is the rich (i.e. a constituted group, in a way as a social class) who are responsible for climate disruption, through their actions or their support for global economic, productive, extrationist systems. It is not 'the people' but a particular group that has privileges and interests in a particular system and has the means to maintain that system. In fact it is a response to mainstream ecology which makes all people feel guilty and talks about ""gestures that count"" etc. Even the term ""Compost"" is well chosen because it distracts from this idea of ""small gestures"" by reminding us that our action must be strong and radical. This is clearly opposed to advocates of the status quo or advocates of political non-violence (non-violence which is often a means of control). The only thing that could be debated is the term Rich rather than Bourgeoisie. Personally I don't mind: although you lose the idea of social class, Rich has the advantage of being unifying and including rich people who don't fit the criteria of the bourgeois class (not enough cultural capital or networks, etc.) but who still dominate populations and whole areas of nature. 

This is far from being a misunderstanding or a youth fad. Besides, if you could avoid discrediting a part of the population (and its ideas) because of its age. That would be nice."

The problem is that you don't want a player that only turns up in clutch moments, you want someone who can do it on a fairly frequent basis that isn't against the elite opponents.

1,"This is a perfect example of how we can’t be trusted to eat the rich because we can’t properly identify the rich. Natalie may be well off thanks to her Patreon, but she also puts a TON of time, effort, and work into every single video she puts out. She’s not sitting around profiting off of the labor of her subjects. She’s creating a product herself that her audience is willing to pay for, and not making anywhere near billions of dollars from it.


Additionally, for a ton of people, her videos are an introduction to leftist concepts. If you go to her sub, you’ll see tons of posts from people who say that her videos are the reason they started down the socialism rabbit hole or how they used to be staunch conservatives before her. In other words, she is directly benefiting the cause of making more people see socialism as a more viable system than capitalism.


Is she more well off than most of us will ever be? Yeah, probably. However, it’s not because she exploited the capitalist system and started leeching off the excess labor of her employees. She puts in her own work to create her own product that people willingly pay for. If we start disavowing anyone who does this because they’ve been “class compromised” then we essentially start telling people that they can’t be a part of the movement if they’re above a certain income bracket. That’s just not helpful at all. I’d be willing to bet that Natalie here has convinced more people to rethink capitalism vs socialism than you have, oh grand internet revolutionist. 


Natalie even states in this video (that I’m sure you definitely watched) that she would gladly pay as many tax dollars as it takes to make sure no one is starving and homeless in a society that has the means to take care of them.


She examines the concept of envy through the lens of capitalism, yes. She does point out that the desire to strip the wealth from capitalists can both be a product of envy AS WELL AS genuine compassion and empathy for the well-being of other humans. Natalie is a philosopher - it’s what her degree is in. Her videos are far more centered on breaking down the human condition and examining abstract concepts. She sprinkles that in with a lot of leftist talking points and helps explain why capitalism is failing us, but the primary point of her videos isn’t to just vaguely talk about socialism and revolution. If that’s what you’re looking for, then her channel isn’t for you. Otherwise, I rather enjoy her content, and I get quite a bit leftist philosophy from her in a more entertaining way than I otherwise would."

As far as I've heard, the Communist government wasn't worried about a Soviet withdrawal, until they found out that the deal didn't require the US to stop funding and arming the Mujahideen.

I'm not saying the government had majority support of rural peasants. But I'm sure it had some support.

Look at Venezuela right now. Conditions couldn't be worse. Materially speaking, there's no incentive for the people to support Maduro. And yet he still has the support of 30% of the country.

You can't underestimate the effect poverty has on peoples' viewpoints."

Which pretty much means game over for human superiority, and AI can overtake a lot of tasks us humans do today. Ray Kurzweil predicts we will get there by 2045. But yes, we are getting closer and there are many tasks AI does better than humans individually, but they don’t have general intelligence. 

For longevity escape velocity (LEV), which is the point in time where advancements in medicine improves faster than you age, we will need to see aging reversal therapies show a reduction in biological age through biomarkers or life extension. There are several therapies in the pipeline now, but they need to go through FDA approval. But it’s not unlikely that many people alive today can expect to live way longer than 80-90 years.

So, when we will have a society where machines can perform better than humans in all or most tasks and we are free of the diseases of old age, what do you think we should do? I guess no one really knows how it will be, but we are heading in that direction and it’s inevitable."

1,"Both Soviet and American occupations of Afghanistan were similar. They were both trying to change a society where 95% of the population hated their guts, and local lives were not considered worth saving by the occupying forces and thousands were killed (even more so by the Soviets, there were more refugees created during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan than at any other point in the country’s history). 

The big difference in favour of the Soviets was that the people the Soviet’s put in charge were good at their jobs. Najib was a good statesman, their education minister knew how to run schools, their health minister knew how to run hospitals, everyone was competent at their jobs and there was next to no corruption. 

Compare that to the Americans, they put every single anti-Taliban warlords they can find, most of whom couldn’t even read their own names, and put them in charge of EVERYTHING.

The attitude toward Marxism changes a lot from country to country, but even from region to region within the same country.

In Italy some regions were majority communist until some decade ago and being a communist there was the norm, so now it's seen as something familiar  grandpa believed in, but in other regions the Red Scare wasn't far from US levels, while others were more mixed.

Overall today both socialism and communism are seen as funny old fashion stuff by most people here, while socialist orgs are small and don't get enough votes to elect people in the parliament.

Socialism and communism here are not scary or taboo but seen as outdated, kind of like religion and other things associated to the past, when ""people still believed in something"" and ""held values"".

Fishman Island: Finding a poneglyph, deciphering it and talking with the King of the Island without the orders of her captain. She took the initiative without anyone knowing. We now know who Joyboy was (a little).

Sharing her Bento with Luffy and compliment Sanji's cooking, warning Luffy about the dangers of an alliance but still going with it despite Luffy's naiveté, showing care for Chopper, etc.

Dressrosa: Caring about Usopp's security when she was pinned down by the tontattas, putting her trust in Usopp despite the fact that he forgot about her after being turned into a doll, Stopping Hakuba easily, fighting with Diamante to protect Rebecca and leaving her battle in the hands of Kyros so he could have his revenge against Diamate and having his moment with her Daughter, Doing her best to protect Rebecca even if she suffered from Injuries. Her conversation with Law after Dressrosa ( I think that's anime-only )

Zou: Relying a lot on her friends, might seem little but seeing her completely trust all of her friends after the whole Enies Lobby ordeal was a great moment for her.

Wano: We knew a ton of stuff about Onigashima thanks to her. She played a major role in the preparation of the raid, her instinct to protect Nami when they were under attack during the bathhouse scene, making Jinbei feel at home in the strawhat crew, saving Sanji from Black Maria, chapter 1020, chapter 1021"

1,"I'm not sure socialism is an economic ideology. It can be framed as that in mainstream economy, as in ""which economic system is best"". But the point of socialism isn't to have a set economic system, it's about developing systems to create an emancipatory society without classes. There have been several different tries in the past, all with lessons for the future of the movement. In the words of Marx:

*Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.*

If you want to understand the classical roots of socialist economic thinking and critique, it will be Das Kapital by Karl Marx. However, that's quite a reading project. You might want to look into David Harveys companion books to it to have a more modern entry into the material. Harvey is also an interesting social geographer in himself, worth to check out.

The communist manifesto is very dated, and it contains for example passages about centralization that Marx and Engels distanced themselves from. If people recommend it to you, do keep in mind that it's an antique program from the mid 1800s, it's not representative of modern Marxism. It's a fun read if you're into history.

As (serious) socialists are more interested writing about the present struggle, critiques of capitalism and ideas about organization, rather than detailing exactly how a future they can't predict will look like, you won't find a plethora of descriptions of this communist society. It's rather understood that it's a new task up to the people who will actually live in to decide. But nevertheless, an early classical socialist book that does elaborate on actual (anarcho-)communist society and how it could function post-capitalism, there is The Conquest of Bread by Peter Kropotkin. It's old, but it can give you a general idea of how the vision for the society is, roughly."

1,"Obviously the Taliban are not great people. We however thought they were good enough to give loads of money and weapons to in the 1980s.

The idea that we could occupy a nation for 20 years (10 of which it seemed as if we forgot we were there) and expect it would just work out when we left is the height of hubris.

You arent really capturing the reason for their rage, or why they yell and scream about it being an ""insurrection"".

They know in their hearts that an actual insurrection would have been justified because biden lost the vote. 

They are terrified of the idea of people standing up to them, and not letting them get away with the fraud.

1,"I see where you're coming from, nonetheless it's gonna be a tough one but I guess natural selection plays a part. With the pandemic going on and deniers getting infected, as sick as it is, it is just straight up self caused death at times. The good news is that the newer generation seems to be much more left leaning so if anything I think we'll just evolve via that. A lot of Gen Z is riddled with trauma, religious trauma, discriminatory trauma in regards to LGBTQ acceptance, just overall shit they were made to go through. It's a running joke that college makes people socialists but it's usually not because of the teaching but instead the processes they have to go through to realize how corrupt the world has become. Anti capitalist sentiment has definitely increased and with everything going on, I believe slow reform will take it's place. Exciting to think about, miserable to wait for.  Right now I'm either waiting for my death or waiting for some radical change to improve the environment. Also man, unironically got shivers when I learned that so many of our junky cheap food products as well as fast fashion are made by exploitation. I guess I'll just sit and wait, do my best to not be a part of the problem. If we die, we die."

Michael Hudson has a nice word for that kind of stuff: 'Marxology'. Very cringe-worthy. It's just another kind of religion, like Catholicism.

Ideological dogmatism, which is based on a claim to absolute knowledge, leads to authoritarian practices.

In a sense 'ever was it so'. This is just something we have to deal with are try to overcome as a movement, like crawling through mud.

There's a lot of bullshit around the left, whether in 'scenes' or parties and organisations. A lot of cultish behaviour which I'm glad you have your eyes open to, because it's pretty dangerous if you're not. As you said, not like killing people (although there are cases like Shining Path), but just sucking the soul out of you bit by bit. I've had one terrible life-changing experience in particular, though I won't get into that here. I've also had positive experiences.

On the other hand, the group you went to are definitely not the standard. There is something better for you out there. It will have its own problems, but you should be able to find something which doesn't have the creepy authoritarian parts (and also the really shoddy organisation). Also calls and texts at 1 am is not the norm, very unprofessional. Please take this as a lesson and don't waste your life with such people again.

It might not be a general socialist party, but it could be a union or a campaign group. It's best to find a functional group with solid people that are doing something, rather than stick with a dysfunctional group which aligns best with your goals in the abstract.

Sorry but main point here, don't make an equivalence between these losers and 'the cause'. If that's all that was possible, the Paris Commune would never have happened. And so on. Just learn your lessons and stay a realistic optimist."

1,"1) They did not criminalize homosexuality, they legalized.

2) You're babbling. They executed people who took up arms directly against them in a civil war where the white army would capture and torture any communists or jews they could get their hands on. When Baron Sturmberg captured the Mongolian capitol, the first thing he did was shoot every jewish resident. This bizarre idea that the bolsheviks weren't the underdog for most of the civil war is weird. The grain thing is grain requisitioning which was not top down, it was bottom to bottom or middle down, and it's standard practice in a war to requisition grain (during the huge famines of the war as well)."
0,I mean not really. The wage structure generally rises obviously but even at bayern you need to prove you are one of the most important players in the squad. revenue also increases over time so rising salaries make somewhat sense generally.

1,"Mainstream economics is completely bogus, so referring to what is au courant in mainstream economics is irrelevant to its truth. Though I know you made a similar qualification, I want to redouble that.

I'm not well read on the LTV, haven't read Capital, etc. So I'm not taking a stance on that either way.

I am very familiar with Michael Hudson though, who might argue that the reason that the LTV 'isn't very usable' in today's economics is because mainstream (or neoclassical) economics began as a project of the ruling class to debunk Marx and provide an ideological rationalisation for their social position. Hence, while classical political economy, out of which came the LTV, focused on the question of eliminating rentiers and thus on how to quantify economic rents, neoclassical economics threw this pursuit out the window and introduced the 'marginalist' framework which has an entirely different purpose.

In fact, let me quote from an [article here](https://michael-hudson.com/2010/07/from-marx-to-goldman-sachs-the-fictions-of-fictitious-capital1/):

>Classical economists developed the labor theory of value to isolateeconomic rent, which they defined as the excess of market price andincome over the socially necessary cost of production (value ultimatelyreducible to the cost of labor). A free market was one free of such“unearned” income – a market in which prices reflected actual necessarycosts of production or, in the case of public services and basicinfrastructure, would be subsidized in order to make economies morecompetitive. Most reformers accordingly urged – and expected – land,monopolies and banking privileges to be nationalized, or at least tohave their free-lunch income taxed away.

So it makes sense that a labour theory of value would have little to no use in today's mainstream economics, since that economics completely ignores economic rent and more or less takes as axiomatic that everybody gets what they produce.

Now, is the LTV the best basis by which to model economic rent? I don't know enough to give an informed answer there. Maybe it isn't."

a billionaire can buy 100% of a club, but he can only have 1 vote less than 50% of the votes and hoping this is enough for getting the club into the direction he wants. Problem here is some, the more important decisions need 66% or even 75% of votes.

0,A lot of people saying he’s finished without Ramos on his side and that he fell off after the game against City. Also some other hilarious takes such as Sean Wright-Phillips saying that Ben White is better signing than Varane.

0,"I've read that he doesn't match what Nuno wants tactically. I'm no tactical genius, but my read of Tanguy is that he always seems to receive the ball, hold up play, try to shimmy two players, and then play a line breaking pass. 

Whereas Nuno's Wolves and our display on Sunday showed quick, decisive driving through the middle and trying to play quickly into our most advanced player. That's a bit of a contrast from what I've seen from Tanguy. 

Someone else can probably explain it better than me, but yeah it doesn't seem like he fits and he doesn't even want to be there."
0,Sure but it’s a fanart so I imagined my scénario
1,"And why now? It's been literally months since the election, not years. Joe hasn't changed all that much since then. He was like this before too and McCain talked about how amazing he's going to be. It's not like this has been years later and everyone has perfect hindsight looking back to say that Joe was a mistake. It's playing out in real time in just months since he supposedly won the election."

1,"When I worked in Afghanistan, I was invited to give some lectures at at Kabul University, graduating law class. About 1/2 women. I'm rarely moved and I loathe pandering puff-talk about women, but I was very moved by this experience. The full reality of the sharp fork in the road between what their life story would have been under the Taliban, versus where they were right now suddenly hit me and gave me full-on chills. 

I was moved by their very real enthusiasm, seriousness and visible gratitude and pride for where they were. Even though they were seniors, it felt like I had met them a few hours after their acceptance letter. 

In the final tally of this war, whether you approved of it or despised it, US and coalition troops freed real-world 21st century chattel slaves. Very few people alive today can say that."

In his entire career he had never fired a weapon other than on a range and he had never been shot at.  In fact, of all the cops I've known, they only ones I know did get shot at were guys who deployed to Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq... and they went as soldiers, not civilian police officers.

Things should be explained to them as fully as possible. I was turned off by a person who did not want to talk to me because I was not important enough. Maurice just wanted to preach to the converted, who already agreed with him. I try to be cordial, because that way you win people over. You cannot win them over by drawing the line of demarcation, saying you are on this side and I am on the other; that shows a lack of consciousness. After the Black Panther Party was formed, I nearly fell into this error. I could not understand why people were blind to what I saw so clearly. Then I realized that their understanding had to be developed.” Huey P Newton."

Think about it for a second. How can the US perpetually import? It's because the dollars used to finance those purchases are, in some measure, never coming back as claims against the nation's real economic output.

This is accomplished by compelling foreigners to hoard dollars. The mechanisms are eurodollar deposits and the Petro dollar recycling program."

As for your broader point, I really don't think Biden's execution of Afghanistan is humanitarian at all. I would point you toward some very tragic footage coming out of the area now but I doubt you'll be able to appreciate just how much people are suffering there due to the specific manner in which Biden withdrew.

There's nothing humanitarian about how we're handling the retreat in Afghanistan."

Inside my ideology, democracy and socialism are two different things, and socialism can of course have democracy.In the main city of Canada, such as Vancouver and Toronto, young people can't afford the house. The house is bought by foreign wealthy new immigrants. These young people can only rent a house until retired.All I can say is that these people have been robbed and they have become slaves of the homeowners.

1,"So, I preface this with saying, of course $3 million is a lot of money. It's more money than I can fathom and it's more money than like 99.99% of people will ever own.  But like, it's not a lot of money. The internet could drag every millionaire influence and it wouldn't make a dent that getting just a small amount of Bezos, Zuckerbergs, Musk's money that they profited by exploiting workers. Like every Ancom (not saying you are one) I've met is not interested in doing outreach, they're not interested in bringing people in the fold who is not 100% already on board. Their worker commune is very ideologically pure, but it's not exactly spreading class conciseness.  
As for mutual aid groups...man, I joined a mutual aid group in my city (Seattle). We fed the homeless (despite a lot of very angry NIMBYs), and collected clothing (at market value) to give out. And it was good! People were grateful and we kept a lot of people warm and full of food (homecooked btw). But you know what? The lines are getting longer.  We either organize and vote in people we want or we do a revolution. Mutual Aid groups are great, but if they can actually help homelessness I'd love to see it. I really do."

1,"But you contradicted yourself right there. It's about ""oppressor/oppressed"" not majority/minority; the idea of an oppressive [white, Christian male] minority is not some mind bending idea to those who promote critical theory. This was an ideology developed in critique of regimes like Apartheid.

When the majority is non-white, they are majoritarians [e.g. their criticisms of Afro-European states or Euro-Hispanic elites]. When the majority is white, they are self-styled defenders of minority rights [e.g. their criticism of Anglo-American states or European indigenous populist movement]."

1,"while your statement may technically be true, it seems to forget that the soviets were guilty of pretty similiar behavior... 

the only difference is the soviets justified it through their ideological dogma (the ends justify the means). because the soviets didn't feel the ""ends"" the anarchists were reaching, their criminal and violent behavior is somehow less legitimate than their own.

Simply that if he was adhering to socialist principles he would not hoard the wealth he does have, and use it to better the conditions of the people he covers, the people that make him money, particularly as they literally live in his city and by buying luxury houses like this he’s only contributing to gentrification and urban sprawl"

1,"Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, Woodrow Wilsons wife/first lady became a tyrant and unelected sitting president for her husband after he suffered a debilitating stroke. 

She even went so far as to cut off access to her husband from the press, congress, his own staff all while forging his signature on documents. 

She usurped power with the help of cover from the media and democrats in congress from Oct. 1919 until the inauguration of Warren Harding, in 1921. 

Interesting that Wilsons time is marked by 3 specific things; Debt, Degradation of race relations, and failed international involvement/policy. 

1) Wilson is the second-largest contributor to the debt, percentage-wise in US history. Surpassed only by FDR and perhaps soon Biden. And somehow created a year long recession despite the ending of WW1. 

2) Implemented the first segregation of federal government departments/offices. Purged the Blacks that William Taft (R) had named to patronage positions in the federal government. Newspapers ran racially inflammatory headlines and lead to increasing race riots and tensions across the country. The 1919 Red Summer and resurgence of extrajudicial lynching's and violence was across the country. 

3) Had a failed involvement (with tens of thousands of American Soldiers in active fighting) in the Russian Civil War that eventually led to pointless (and forgotten) deaths of Americans in Siberian wasteland, the victory and birth of the Communist Red Army, and a galvanized new communist government that would always view the US as dangerously adversarial. All without an actual plan of action while in Russia in the first place."
1,"More importantly, Hollywood, Youtube, Twitter, Reddit, Huffington Post, dailybeast, etc. are all mostly silent on the actual crime that has been committed.

Interestingly, what in my experience over the past weekend and today is showing, is that most folks don't realize that the Taliban took very seriously the Trump May 1 deadline. 

Biden Broke The Deal, so the Taliban were then not compelled to honor any of the previous negotiations, which called for a cautious but safe withdrawal. Not giving a lot of credit to the Taliban, but they played by our rules and Biden screwed them."

In case you don't know, the early communists were the wealthy class who could afford to study in France, and so was my great grandfather. However, most of these people died in the revolution. China was too poor at that time.people would sell their children for halfyear food, and people who died of hunger on the roadside were likely to be eaten by others. As a virtuous person, you have three meals a day , but then you find out that your best friend sold his two daughters inside a brothel. It's inevitable that a revolution will break out.

Although while Zuma&Co were ultimately unsuccessful, their inhumanety goes a bit beyond taking advantage of desperate people for political leverage in that, while everyone was distracted by citizens scrambling for much needed goods, there were organized attacks on roads and trucks depots critical to supply, grain storage warehouses were burned down, chemical companies that supply pharmaceuticals were destroyed, various ammo depots were robbed.

It’s so interesting that nobody has faith in our government to handle social equality issues or the homeless crisis.

But when it comes to letting our politicians decide whether or not we can leave our houses or pick and choose what is or isn’t essential we think they’ll nail it? This will be the one time they don’t abuse their power or use these new precedences to enable their political agenda? I just don’t see that being the case.

0,"The idea is that we will always field as competitive of a team as we can, averaging out at around 45 wins, and that in the long run we’ll naturally deviate from the mean +/- 10 wins - becoming a contender or underperforming and narrowly missing the playoffs. It’s really not a bad strategy for a small market. You can’t hope to build a warriors-esque dynasty in Indiana. Players will just leave and the payroll bill will come too high. 

We’ve had a lot of bad luck. We’ve been legit contenders in 3 distinct eras over the last 30 years. MJ, Shaq / Kobe Lakers, Malice, and the Heatles kept us from winning any titles. Also a firm believer that if Oladipo stayed healthy and stayed at even 90% of his 2017/18 level over the past couple of years, we would have been contenders in the east the last 2 years. 

When the strategy has worked and had us in a position to contend 3-4 times over 3 decades, why not keep that strategy when the risks of tanking are so high? Who knows, maybe Duarte turns out to be a Khris Middleton-level player or Sabonis becomes an All-NBA caliber center or Myles wins DPOY. All unlikely, but then again so was Oladipo’s rapid improvement or drafting a player of PG’s caliber at pick #10.

Basically a long winded way of saying if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. There’s gonna be some seasons spent in purgatory but that’s just the cost of doing business in a small market."

1,"I think generally your idea to broaden solidarity is a positive one. But one aspect you're missing is that revolutionary socialists aren't specifying classes/worker types just for the hell of it, we do so in order to focus on who to organize. A small business owner may work for example but they also employ others and exploit their labor, generally they will be less sympathetic to revolutionary politics. And cops may come from the working class in general but are class enemies based on their role in society. This is why we ""separate"" at times, in order to analyze the material conditions and figure out where best to put our organizing energy. That is why we focus on more exploited wage workers in direct conflict with the bosses, they have the most potential for a revolutionary uprising."

But why shouldn't the USA invade Iraq for oil? We're a stronger and bigger nation, we need the oil. Plus, the Iraqis didn't know how to use it and could possibly sell it to our enemies. If we own the oil, it can't be misused. Life has always been about the strongest surviving.

**Devils advocate stops**

Now, by using devils advocate like this and explaining both sides we can educate people on WHY it's wrong to invade Iraq and killions thousands upon thousands of people. We can discuss things like how ridicolous of an idea it is for some one to own natural resources. Especially people who have no previous contact with politics might think that some of the things I said, makes sense in a way. By preparing the other person for these other arguments, they can understand ""both sides"".

This is something my dad did a lot when I grew up. He made me question why I think in a certain why and why the other person thinks in a certain way. Asking why is a very good tool for education.

Both you and I know it's wrong to invade Iraq for oil but we need to explain why it's wrong. Imperialist propaganda, as we know, usually removes the human part of these things.

1,"Personally I don't think that's a good enough excuse for the theft that landlords commit against people.

Also if you look at actual examples of retired elderly landlords of the type your talking about there usually upper middle class and live a relatively luxurious lifestyle. 

Actual poor people can't afford to buy a second house and use the second house they don't live in as a source of unearned income.

If we did expropriate them without compensation they would still have the house they live in they just couldn't steal from other people anymore to make a living.

Also we have a pension system that old people are supposed to live off of instead of stealing from other people and making life harder for other people in the process. and I think any socialist government that would do expropriate without compensation of all landlords would as make it a top priority to expand pensions for the elderly to make life easier for old people.

In hockey both goals and assists award players points, which is a key stat to judge the all-around quality of an offensive player. Gretzky is the all-time leader in points by 970 points. That means if you subtracted his 894 goals from the record books he would STILL be the all-time points leader with just assists alone. 

In basketball we’ll talk about “points contributed” to include buckets and points off assists. Just imagine someone in basketball contributing to more points than any other player in history without ever making a bucket or in baseball leading in RBIs without hitting a home run. It’s pretty crazy IMO."

0,"THEORY ABOUT KING: 

King's race, which was thought to be extinct, lives on the Red Line and they are enemies of the certain race we are familiar with.

  
There is no information provided about the height of the Red Line, however we know that it reaches the clouds, so we can say that it is [6000 meters above sea-level](https://i.imgur.com/Q0wWIe9.png), while the ""White Sea"" of the Sky Islands starts at 7000 meters and the ""White-White Sea"" starts at 10000 meters.

  
During the Skypiea arc, we discovered that there are two ways to get to Skypiea, one being the Knock-up Stream and the other being ""The Summit of the High West"".

  
""The summit of the high west"" could be located on the Red Line(Summit means Top,and red line is located West of Skypiea) and since they're just Km's away from White Sea and White-White sea,they could be connected with something similar to the [""Milky Road"".](https://i.imgur.com/HTLLIwf.png)

  
The King's appearance, with fire burning, demon wings, and red eyes, makes him look like a demon. On the other hand, on Sky Island,we have people who have angelic features. One of their islands is even referred to as ""Angel Island"".King's race and people of the Sky Island are the opposites.

  
People from the Sky island and King's race waged war against each other in the past and King's race lost it, almost drawing them to extinction, though some still live on the Red Line. Gan Fall described using the Summit of the High West dangerous and not everyone will live using it to travel. Perhaps King's race will kill on sight, which could explain why Bellamy survived and the rest of his crew died when travelling to the Sky Island, he is strong enough to fight them off."

The COVID unemployment assistance is separate from COVID rental assistance, but there are huge swaths of the population that don't qualify for either. For the current phase of rental assistance in my state, for example, you have to prove that:

* Your income is below the limit AND
* You've lost income directly due to the pandemic AND
* You are at risk of eviction

Unemployment benefits usually have similar qualifications, and in many states are still maxed at 26 weeks per year (pandemic hit \~75 weeks ago). 

So yeah, even these shitty half-assed programs by Democrats still exclude a huge percentage of the population affected by the pandemic."

0,"I’m not sure many people still remember or know that Indiana was *the* basketball state for almost 100 years before Malice. James Naismith wrote extensively about Hoosier Hysteria and our particular obsession with basketball, and the inventor of the sport himself said “Basketball really had its origin in Indiana, which remains the center of the sport.” To this day we still have 7-8 of the 10 biggest HS basketball gyms in the nation. 

I think Malice really changed the self-image several generations of Hoosiers had as proud basketball fans. A lot of older fans that would’ve been integral for imparting the sanctity of local basketball succumbed to ‘’man screams at cloud’ level complaints about the Pacers being thugs and dissociated completely. Decades worth of die-hard fans immediately rejected the Pacers as a signifier of cultural/ethical changes, or at the very least as a touchy subject to avoid. Many typical Hoosiers I know who still attend 20 or more HS/college games a year are still bitterly dismissive of the Pacers to this day.

It’s also worth considering that up until 2004 the Colts and football in general took a definitive backseat in Indiana- but following Malice in 2004 and culminating in the 2007 Colt’s SB win, things started transitioning towards the Colts and away from Pacers. 

I think how the Pacers have approached branding and team building in the years since demonstrates the strange line they try to walk. There’s an emphasis on blue collar work ethic and old school traditions because they have a *state* history almost no other franchise shares or rivals, but there’s a ton of reticence there too as they try to avoid mentioning the alienating failures of the past. The other considerations in this thread about us being bottom 5 in revenue is another factor, but I don’t think it’s necessarily more important to our owner Herb Simmon as some of the other things I’ve mentioned above."

Almost 80% of the current problems can be traced back to capitalism (in both Operation Cyclone and its inheritors as well as Gorbachev’s policies). It would undoubtedly have been better for the DRA to continue existing but that’s long past possible. 

I believe that the funding of terrorism will be massively increased, with the aim of destabilizing the country and exporting terrorists to neighbors. Accordingly, it remains to be seen whether these neighbors will be able to finally stabilize Afghanistan, through a taliban government or otherwise.

I think South Korea is a much better model if you want to go around making democracies than West Germany (which was already a democracy in living memory).

1,"And even if America did have to use the atom bomb on Japan (they didn't), they could've bombed a military target instead of a civilian one. That would've had the same effect on the Japanese government, because they didn't actually care if civilians were killed. The most that was needed was a demonstration of the weapon.

But as Mr Mandela's said in this clip, they needed to demonstrate its impact on civilians to the Soviets as a show of force. It's disgusting."

But we can also talk about it in terms of relationships - the worker has no choice but to work without having a say in how to distribute or use the profit of the company. The boss/capitalist can through their social position alone order a worker to do things in order to sustain their riches.
And as I said, I think there is a value being extracted, but we can't easily derive the value of goods from that value."

For example I can't see why a shot from outside the area hitting the target would indicate confidence, while one that goes a bit wide doesn't. An alternative explanation would be that somebody feeling low on confidence may not back themselves to strike it properly so underhit the shot meaning it is on target but not dangerous while the confident player hits it hard backing themselves to make it without holding back on power. I wonder though if there is some statistical backing to this."

1,"“The different spheres of production, it is true, constantly tend to an equilibrium: for, on the one hand, while each producer of a commodity is bound to produce a usevalue, to satisfy a particular social want, and while the extent of these wants differs quantitatively, still there exists an inner relation which settles their proportions into a regular system, and that system one of spontaneous growth; and, on the other hand, the law of the value of commodities ultimately determines how much of its disposable working-time society can expend on each particular class of commodities.”

One example is how one of our highest ranked ministers was accused of an extremely violent and graphic rape by a woman, and our PM backed the minister and refused to conduct an internal investigation. The poor woman killed herself due to depression and now the police can't do anything. This happened this year. 

But for me what perfectly encapsulates what a massive piece of shit our government is is the case of [the Biloela family](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-56768529). The Biloela family are valued members of their rural community, having come to Australia as refugees, and have given birth and raised two kids here. Literally the definition of a refugee success story. But we can't have that, so the Australian government has spent millions trying to deport this family. They have kept them locked up in a detention centre in the middle of the Indian Ocean for 3 years now, and the children go to school in a police van. Just recently the 4 year old daughter had to be flown to Perth because of a blood infection because she wasn't being given proper treatment. 

But the Australian public will keep voting the cunts in, although hopefully their mismanagement of the vaccine rollout will change that"

He bought a house for *himself* in LA (mind this, LA is really f-cking expensive when it comes to property prices). He's a twitch streamer and is self-employed, doesn't exploit anybody.

1,"I mean I don't see it as ""doomerism"" or ""doomism"" or whatever. I don't see it as a call to do nothing and to just give up.

I see it as 1) a part of the natural grieving process. How can you read about the history of the USSR collapsing and not feel grief? How can you not read about the murder of Fred Hampton and not feel sadness and loss? How can you not read about attempts for universal healthcare to happen in the US since the 60s with nothing to result of it and not feel depressed. How can you hear how the US government is making only surface level changes to combat climate change and have never made more than surface level climate changes and not feel panic?

All of these are natural reactions to bad shit. If you lose a loved one it is natural to feel sad and a feeling of loss. If you're in the middle of a natural disaster it is natural to feel scared. Arguing that not reacting to these is the height of avoidance and toxic positivity and is no more productive than nihlism.

Because even if you feel negatively it doesn't mean that there is nothing to be done. I have been depressed and anxious for almost all of the Pandemic. I have also made sure that people in my community were fed and made sure that they didn't lose their housing, all while still doing my actual job of therapy with them. What I have decided that I cannot do enough about are global or national issues. There is nothing I can reasonably do about the US military polluting and destroying the world. There is nothing I can reasonably do to convince Biden and Congress to finally institute universal healthcare in the country. So...why focus on that? Why focus on electoralism that has failed to bring about lasting change in our country? I'd much rather disinvest from the national stage and focus solely on what I can change in my community (organizing, resource sharing, etc.) then support AOC in getting healthcare when even she doesn't think it will happen soon and I'm not even in her state. Being anxious or depressed doesn't really change what I'm going to do. I'm still going to try to make my community better no matter what. Will I try as hard to get Biden to change? Hahahaha no. Will I care as much about what Florida GOP or Michigan Dems or China or the Taliban are doing? Nope. That doesn't mean that I'm doing nothing though or that it's not important, it just means I'm focusing on what I can affect and change. It's honestly healthier that way."

He can keep up with the fastest guards in the league and use his length to shut off their passing lanes. He can block jumpers all the way out the three point line.

1,"Whoa, calm down, brother. You jumped to this pretty fast...

>but to say it was gonna be “either way” as in the same would have happened if Trump was POTUS I have to disagree

**Don't get defensive**. I know what it feels like to have an emotional attachment to a presidency too. Can I know, for a fact, that the situation would have gone down exactly the same? As you said, no one can know that.

We do know that Trump would have had essentially the same military (same enlisted soliders) and for the most part the same upper brass as Biden has right now. There are no orders that Trump could give to that military that would have fixed the situation. **If you can think of what that order would be, please tell me!!!!**

If you want a different perspective on that, you should ask **someone you know really well who has served**. When you give the enemy notice (and even when you don't) the gears start to turn. Below a certain troop level, you have to begin evacuating even faster and things get messy. This is pretty common for this kind of operation. There isn't anything Trump could have done differently to make this any better (or worse). It is a bandaid that just has to be ripped off.

Without American troops station in Afghanistan indefinitely (which has been the norm for the past 20 years) it was always going to return to the Taliban. They are the power in the area and that area has been in disarray much longer than 20 years. The Soviets made the same mistakes we did back in the 80s. It can't be held unless you want to own it and **pay for it in blood every year.**"

As for the mass strikes, you are perhaps referring to the ongoing farmer strikes? While they are against the right wing Government in general, the horde is itself largely comprised of parochial, hierarchical power structures of rural North India.

To the establishment clubs it's a travesty that goes against the natural order.

A good example of how these lines get blurred further is Liverpool's kit deal with warrior in 2012.

Most of the time the players don't bring it up but honestly I think it's OK for there to be some context.

Sixers want a win-now player in return. the wolves dont have one (or rather dont want to give them away) and can only offer young players + picks. Sixers dont want young players + picks because Embiid is not getting any younger (or healthier). 

so they need a 3rd team that has a win-now player and wants young players + picks. 

Wolves get Simmons, 3rd team gets young players + picks from minny and Sixers get win-now player from 3rd team.

Jesters may be on the rise, but Fire are still the big youth club in the city.

Also, if you went to any Jesters games this year, you almost certainly saw my dad as one of the referees. His certification only allows him to be an assistant referee at that level, but he still had to deal with Kenny's constant fucking whining.

Also, totally unrelated, but Jesuit's coach/Fire Executive Director and fellow Irishman Hubie Collins is basically a Great Value brand Kenny."

1,"Socialism is the logical conclusion of the laws of development of capitalism, but a conclusion that isn't promised to happen. The people living in the capitalist mode of production have to fight to bring about this conclusion, this revolution. 

As for dialectics, it's complicated to explain. In a way, dialectics is a form of logic, distinct from formal/analytical logic, as it analyzes categories in flux, in motion, full of contradictions, contradictions that transcend themselves... Basically, in philosophy, you have a whole bunch of categories, like quantity and quality, chance and necessity, one and many, identity and difference, absolute and relative, that are conceived as fixed and as complete opposites, as ""one or the other"" types of categories. Dialectics tries to show the continuity of these opposites, and how they move from one the other, while explaining as well how and why these categories oppose themselves, how they contradict themselves - i.e. a unity of opposites. Very important to dialectics is also motion, transformation. Often when analyzing phenomena with the dialectical method it is shown how these phenomena are historic, whether in natural history (life hasn't always existed and is therefore a historical category, a category that isn't eternal), or human history (class society is not an eternal category but one which has its birth and, hopefully, death). Dialectics puts things in the context of time, in a way.

To Hegel dialectics is sort of logical method, but not a method applied to the world as a method external to the world, but a method taking its source in the world to which it is applied, describing the internal laws of the world and each things themselves."

1,"Right? Not only that, but what is the desired outcome of right wing liberal democracies taking action? Western governments aren’t going to make India more socialist. In fact, they’re likely to continue to exploit and extract resources. It’s funny to me when people call for western countries to intercede as if that’s ever resulted in anything but a country moving further right or becoming more totalitarian. India becoming socialist in no way benefits the wealthy interests of western states.

Now if these calls are for “the people” of the west to do something, I totally agree. We should be, at the very least, showing solidarity and raising awareness. This post is doing that but I just have to call out the irony of asking for imperialist responses to problems created, in part, by imperialism from the same people who decry the imperialist west."

1,"It violates freedom of speech -- [Tinker v Des Moines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_v._Des_Moines_Independent_Community_School_District) I think covers this:

>The court's 7–2 decision held that the First Amendment applied to public schools, and that administrators would have to demonstrate constitutionally valid reasons for any specific regulation of speech in the classroom. The court observed, ""It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.""

If it's a public school then this would easily be overruled via supreme court given the present example. The family of the expelled child can and should threaten legal action against the school for violation of first amendment rights.

As a Hoosier, I'm well aware of the anti-leftist stigmas in many parts of the state. I was lucky to be in a comparatively progressive county, so I faced no repercussions for openly wearing a hammer and sickle t-shirt in high school, having explicitly communist pins on my backback, reading Lenin, Marx, etc during study periods, and so on. Best of luck for your friend in dealing with this issue. It shouldn't be hard to overturn at all as public schools do not have the right to censor the freedom of speech or expression of students, including by administrative action such as expulsion."

1,"> Zach Vorhies, who previously worked for Google, said in an interview with The Epoch Times that the tech titan specifically tailored its news algorithm to harm the former president.

> Vorhies has written a book about his experience working at Google. He said he wanted to “take conspiracy theory and turn it into conspiracy fact” by sharing the practices he saw as a longtime former employee, working on both Google and YouTube projects.

> “People kind of suspect this is happening. That certain keywords trigger things within the algorithm … That is actually happening,” he told the Times, noting that newly written stories about Trump were digitally married with older ones to ensure they remained at the top of search results.

> “They actually have that. They show like a graph, a tree, and they say actually this forms a super-story that spans eight days,” he said.

> “So, with the Trump/[former FBI Director James] Comey thing, they’re able to keep the stories boosted all the way at the top because the algorithm was able to fold a news story into the stories that were preceding it in the last five days,” Vorhies added.

> “They allowed the mainstream media to structure their stories so that they could remain at the top of their search index, of their news index,” he continued.

> Vorhies’ new book is called “Google Leaks: A Whistleblower’s Exposé of Big Tech Censorship.” The book dropped earlier this month.

> “The madness of Big Tech and their attempt to mold our reality into a version compatible with their globalist view of the world has never been portrayed better than in this chilling account by Google whistleblower,” the book’s listing on Amazon states.

> “As a senior engineer at Google for many years, Zach was aware of their bias, but watched in horror as the 2016 election of Donald Trump seemed to drive them into dangerous territory. The American ideal of an honest, hard-fought battle of ideas — when the contest is over, shaking hands and working together to solve problems — was replaced by a different, darker ethic alien to this country’s history,” the description adds.

> Vorhies said he left Google in 2019 with 950 pages of internal documents and gave them to the Justice Department.

> It is unclear what, if anything, the DOJ did with those documents.

> Vorhies also made the documents public with the help of Project Veritas in 2019. The former employee previously told Project Veritas and founder James O’Keefe how he was able to get ahold of the documents from his former employer in 2019.

> “These documents were available to every single employee within the company that was full time. And so as a full-time employee at the company, I just searched for some keywords, and these documents started to pop up,” he said.

> “And so once I started finding one document and started finding keywords for other documents and I would enter that in and continue this cycle until I had a treasure trove and archive of documents that clearly spelled out the system, what they’re attempting to do in very clear language,” he concluded.

> Vorhies spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this year, alongside O’Keefe and Project Veritas.

> “Google, Facebook and the Big Tech oligarchs represent the Trojan horse for totalitarianism,” he said."

What about the Willock we saw under Emery who was getting slated after every match for not being good enough? 

Martinelli is more experienced but he's not experienced enough to lead the line was my point. Every Arsenal fan I saw was happy in the pre-match line-up thread with the team we put out, it's only after the game everyone had a problem. 

Don't play Balogun = Arteta doesn't trust the youth.
Play Balogun = Arteta throws them into the fire.

Look, I dont rate Arteta at all but it's a bit strange to criticize him for not trusting young players. Maybe there just aren't any talents on the same level as Saka and ESR? How many teams have players breaking through from the academy every season? It's not realistic.

>Saying a 19 year old who’s starting out his first full season having” best seasons” is a small sample size and a bit premature, who’s to say they wouldn’t have reached higher levels anyway? 

That's not the same as saying every young player has regressed under him is it? 

>i think you’re just stating things for the sake of arguing at this point mate

Classic line when you don't have a leg to stand on. You can't really tell me any young players who have regressed under Arteta despite saying every single one has. All our signings are under 25, how is that not building for the future?"

I can't lie about US never profiting from war because they have as ı know US has profited from wars and ınstabilty ın central America. But ı don't think it is right to say that the current US government is profiting from any wars at least ones that they cause the thing is wars are expansive and no government can profit from it unless the region they are conquering is worth the lives and the money they are spending the better thing is to just support rebellions and separatist groups and when the nations is in a civil war or a conflict send a ""peacekeeping force"" to exploit local resources.  I support the argument you make and yes US has an a ınequality problem with top 1% being rich and population not having enough money but that would be a stupid way to recruit people US only relies on volunteers ıf they wanted more men in the army for a war they could just send a letter to some of the men that is fit for a military position and say ""Hey you are in the army now report to the nearest recruitment center"" that wouldn't be really hard or something that radical because they have done it in the past ı just think that US government is scared of doing something ""Communist"" and angering few old ppl which isn't evil that's what we called being ""Stupid""."

1,"Well, fair play for actually reading all of that.

Murray Bookchin is definitely worth a read. He was my route out of anarchism really. He advocated a synthesis of the best of anarchism and Marxism. To see what he was saying about local politics, you'd need to engage with his entire proposal which he called 'libertarian municipalism' or 'communalism'. Its central concern is the establishment of participatory democratic institutions. It was the primary (though not sole) intellectual influence on the Rojava revolution. He wrote about it in various articles, books, and you can find video interviews online too. *The Next Revolution* is a collection of essays published posthumously which offers a pretty good overview of his thought. I'm a bit hazy on his arguments around local vs. national elections though, it's been a while and I can't remember where he addresses it in a very practical way. Worth checking out regardless though.

I think the electoral question is a very difficult one (here follows a long summary of the Irish situation you didn't ask for and nobody asked for). For instance, I'm not sure what I think about the Irish situation. Ireland has effectively not had a Left compared to other countries. The space for radical politics has always been taken up by republicanism, which has had important left leaning minority strands but which never attained the status of the Left in, say, Britain or France. Today in the Republic of Ireland, electoral politics has entered a new phase. Traditionally, two conservative parties have dominated completely, which formed in the early C20 out of the war of independence and civil war: Fianna Fáil (FF) and Fine Gael (FG). With the mildly significant exception of a few minority Green and Labour coalition partners, which I might add have been even less left wing than Green and Labour parties elsewhere.

FF and FG are pretty much indistinguishable. FG is more ideologically neoliberal, whereas FF is a little more opportunist. But splitting hairs. The Greens are 'Fine Gael on bikes', and the Labour Party was annihilated electorally for its embrace of neoliberalism and full-throated attacks on anti-austerity movements. 

Into the fray walks Sinn Féin, the 'political wing' of the former Provisional Irish Republican Army. Hovering around 10% in the South for the past 10 years, it is now the most popular party and everyone expects it to be in government next election, due to its more or less progressive and populist programme of resistance to rentiers in housing, insurance, healthcare, and so on.

So what should an Irish leftist do? Join Sinn Féin and try to push it left (with a view to maybe breaking off in 10-20 years)? After all, there are some real progressives and even socialists within the party, even at the top levels (like Eoin O'Broin). And polling shows they have 50% support among under 35s. On the other hand, they have a history of opportunism, tend to be more committed to nationalism than socialism, and have an eerily similar politics to Fianna Fáil back in 1926 (before they became complete wankers). Join one of the many tiny Irish mostly Marxist-Leninist left wing parties? One of the two Trotskyist parties with a few TDs, who somehow haven't imploded yet? Or another one even fewer have heard of? Or start a new party? Or eschew electoral politics and just do movement work? Take up the violin?

It's really not an easy question. (I usen't to have to answer it because I was an anarchist!) These questions intrinsically depend on what *other people* are doing. In particular, when there's not much of a Left, as in Ireland, it's even harder to decide. As long as we recognise that the fate of the movement is determined by the objective conditions of the masses, we won't go insane trying to single-handedly change the course of history.

As for climate change, I know ('know') there won't be a revolution in 10 years in a developed country, but by 2050 we will be living in a totally different world. All bets are off - I think it will be constant tumult one way or the other. The people who believe that this 'normality' can just keep trundling along are really in for a shock. The thing about reality is that you can ignore it, but it can't ignore you. I often say to people 'come back to me in 30 years and tell me what you think then'.

>I guess that for now, I will keep organising in my union and Momentum,working on the small wins against our awful system and trying to raiseas much political consciousness as possible.

I'm detached but it seems to be an interesting time for the British left, difficult but a time of change.

Anyway, it takes discipline and courage to be an organiser so good on you and good luck comrade."

0,"Defense in hockey is not very well defined. Honestly even r/hockey has a very outdated idea of what it means to be good at defense. There are many types of defenses in hockey - just like how there's perimeter defense, transition defense and rim protection in basketball but the defenses are much more fluid and so are the roles. No one player excels at all aspects of defense and/or offense. 

But generally speaking, Gretzky was good defensively. He was particularly good at stealing the puck and positioning himself to take away passing lanes. His best trait however was keeping the puck in control for his team.

Edit: In terms of Mario being better, statistically the gap is just too large. However I saw both play and by my eye test?

In the Kane saga, I've seen a lot of comments that are essentially 'Levy can stick to his valuation all he wants and, if City don't meet it, then he doesn't have to sell'. Here we have a similar example where a City player is open to leaving provided City's valuation is met. But the comments I read here go completely against what's being said in the Kane saga and are pointing the finger at City for overvaluing a player. Some even saying City should lower they're valuation to meet other clubs valuations. 

My opinion is, he was worth around 60m when City bought him, he hasn't got any worse since then so 60m asking price isn't an unreasonable value. I'm also of the opinion that no club is entitled to a discount when buying a player and no team should be pressured into selling a player for less than their valuation. If a team wants him, put a respectable offer in and if City think it's fair, you'll have him signed. The exact same thing I think City should be doing with Kane seen as it's obvious Levy isn't going to back down at this point."
0,"Anyone seen any movies lately? 
I watched The World of Kanako and The Intouchables 

**The World of Kanako** is about an ex cop who looks for his estranged daughter who turns out to be a different person than everybody thinks. 

I really liked the first 20 minutes. They are stylish and sweaty with bursts of violence that quickly establish a seedy atmosphere of an unwelcoming, unappealing and uncompromising world where everyone is an asshole culminating in the Tarantino-esque intro sequence that shaped my expectations into thinking that it will be something along the lines of a dark, stylish, ultra violent but occasionally slightly tongue in cheek crime thriller, but it's misleading at best and after the third misogynistic scene, followed by yet another unnecessary scene of violence, neither of which add anything besides shock value for the sake of it, it quickly emerged that this is a movie without a single merit. For like 5 minutes the tastelessness actually works as intended but the repetition and brazenness make it wear off quickly, which means the remaining 90 minutes don't work at all and it only becomes more unwatchable with every instance. It tries so hard to derive meaning from its over the top shock value without knowing what that's supposed to be that any attempt to make this shallow, forced, offensive and disgusting piece of shit have any meaning is laughable and insulting. 

The story revolves around Kanako, who we barely get to see in the first half, and how her ruthless father does everything to find her. But not to safe her mind you, but so he can kill her himself. It's as subtle as it sounds. With every new lead arise scenes where he injures, kills or rapes someone for no reason other than to cheaply and abrasively establish the ""theme"" that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree and make it edgy. The way this is executed is so agressively disproportionate that it's like carpet bombing your house after finding a spider and since it's the only character trait he possesses, it runs its already short course rather quickly, which doesn't stop the movie from constantly doing it over and over again though. It's as one note as it gets. It's either rape, killing, or him calling his daughter a filthy whore without any substance being conveyed at any point or any rhyme or reason to how anything progresses or why things are happening. It's like The Rise of Skywalker with more rape. Rinse and repeat. 

When it eventually focuses on the daughter it's mostly through flashbacks from 3 years prior and the way it's shot and edited is fucking nauseating. As many cuts a second as Liam Neeson climbing over a fence and about as steady as Gaspar Noé on coke.
It makes even the most basic interactions unwatchable and that is before taking the awful and repetitive writing into account. 
How she shows her true nature and how it is explored is contrived and makes sense maybe once. It's actually kind of funny that this supposed mastermind that is able to wrap everyone around her finger has exactly one trick up her sleeve that she applies to everyone even if it makes no sense. It makes sense for the emo boy and the movie cranks up every element that plays into it to 11 to make sure the meanwhile brain damaged audience doesn't miss it. It doesn't even have a sliver of credibility. It's pathetic and transparent beyond belief. 

One of the worst part being where the one dude returns to school the first day after being in the gang's favor. I know it's supposed to be on the nose but it's way too on the nose. It makes power fantasies of nerdy characters in made for TV kids movies where the role of jock and nerd is reversed look restrained and thought out. How this is going to play out is obvious before it's even set in motion and that's something I could tell even though my brain was trying to make me forget this absolute dross while watching it and I'm sure the movie wanted it to be more surprising than it turned out to be, which isn't at all. 

It's so fucking disjointed and the cop is so comically evil that I thought his need to rape was so strong that he was raping a woman in a commercial at one point but that was apparently the wife or something of some mafia dude. Don't know if that was intentionally confusing or it's just a badly made movie. 

I don't even know if ""the apple doesn't fall far from the tree"" or some variation of that is literally all this movie wants to say or if something else was lost in the godawfulness but I wouldn't know because every second that's spent thinking about anything in this movie is a second more than it deserves und I tuned out around two-thirds in because I just wanted this insulting piece of shit to be over. The ""twist"", if it was supposed to even be one, where it turns out he raped his daughter isn't shocking or makes you see the cop in a new light because it's completely on-brand for him, which doesn't make it a twist as much as it's just another confirmation for what the movie already beats you over the head with. And even if the last 30 minutes turned out to be a  unparalleled experience in storytelling, it still wouldn't change the fact that it's a completely irredeemable in every way. 

It can't be overstated how incredibly trashy, vulgar and crass it is for the sake of it, while at the same time being vapid and predictable, consisting of a variation the same 3-4 scenes. It's absolutely worthless and everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves. Ai Hashimoto deserves better. Ranks somewhere among the worst 5 movies I have ever seen.
1/10


I tried to watch **The Vertical Ray of the Sun** but I fell asleep halfway through. 

But that was definitely on me and not the movie. 
Despite its simple premise it isn't straight forward at all so I couldn't just fill in the blanks and still get the full experience. 

Maybe it's a bit too leisurely paced but I really enjoyed the cinematography and how shots are framed and composed, always being busy and full of color, occasionally giving me some In The Mood For Love vibes. The writing is engaging and I enjoyed the interactions between the characters. The music was unusual for the setting but worked really well.
One thing that sucked is the terrible quality of the ""DVD"" I saw. This movie has to be experienced with all of its rich colors in full effect. 

So from what I actually saw I really liked it and I'm definitely going to give it another go some time.
If only I could have fallen asleep watching Kanako instead.


**The Intouchables** is about the unlikely relationship of a wheelchair bound millionaire and his caretaker. 

This movie doesn't reinvent the wheel and character and structure wise you've seen it a million times already. But where it shines is with the performances and the chemistry between the two leads, as well as an overall genuine and heartfelt execution. 

I don't think the opening scene was needed, however, playing September by Earth, Wind and Fire negates any criticism. How their relationship starts off isn't all that convincing and one of the few things that felt a bit too conventional, but it naturally and gradually develops into something very believable. The third act also feels a bit rushed at times and it's overall to the movie's detriment that it adheres so much to this basic structure. The necessary conflict for example doesn't really arise naturally and feels forced.
The daughter character and her boyfriend also don't add anything and their arcs are left unresolved. But all these things don't take too much away, even the comedy that occasionally tries too hard doesn't, because every interaction between the main characters, of which there are many, offers everything you could wish for in a movie like this, which makes it rise above its flaws. They carry the movie and it's nice to see their friendship develop so naturally and observe their growth without specifically having scenes that only serve to show that to the audience. 
Even though it's very funny and entertaining movie, the interactions are the heart and soul of it and a lot of the entertainment value is a product of them. 

I don't think it's as good as it's made out to be but it's still genuinely entertaining and way better than most comedies with a similar structure.

And then, when the capitalist camp eventually came out on top from the ashes they left in their wake during the Lebanese civil war, they did nothing but tank the economy and perpetuate the state of decay and devastation we still live in. They called it ""The miracle of free market capitalism"". We are a country that can be salvaged, but it would be unprofitable to do so.

0,"I strongly disagree with Sanji is in the 3rd place because someone has to be there. Oda made a conscious narrative decision when he created both Zoro and Sanji as two sides of the same coin, yin and yang, they complete each other as the wings of Pirate King. From their design, one uses primarily upper body, the other uses primarily lower body. One has right eye opens, the other has left eye opens. Their rivalry isn't created out of thin air. They are meant to be a pair.

As for why Sanji seems to always be excluded from the Monster Trio, it's because Sanji is the shadow to Zoro's light. Zoro already had a name attached to himself before joining Luffy, and is easily the most recognizable name in the Straw Hats, while Sanji is given an entire different role of working in the shadow, like a spy or stealth expert. In a way, Sanji works like a hidden trump card that Oda likes to use to catch the enemies off guard. This is also the reason why he got his bounty photo taken last, because Oda wants to keep Sanji in the shadow for as long as he could, because things will change once WCI comes. Sanji's bounty now being higher than Zoro signifies this change where the world finally recognizes that Luffy has more than one pillar support.

One last thing I want to mention is Luffy's dream is pretty much Zoro's and Sanji's dream combined. The competitiveness of being a pirate king is similar to Zoro wanting to be the strongest swordman, while One Piece the treasure is as mythical as All Blue. This is why saying that only Zoro shares similarity to Luffy is blatantly false, as Sanji also shares just as much as Zoro, even down to having a mentor with a missing limb."

my mother’s grandparents who came from Sicily were socialists running from the government and the mob, and when they got here my great grandfather became an organizer in the states. so i grew up hearing about that in glowing terms, even have his copy of Roberts rules actually. 

it also helped that i grew up in Texas, in a particularly conservative place even for here, and even having progressive politics will get you called a commie. which eventually has the effect of teaching you “so wanting good things for the world and the people in it means i’m a commie”, which kind of makes that transition easier imo. if all good things are a sign of communism, why wouldn’t you be a communist right?"

Then you consider his elite rebounding and defense, along with his great playmaking skills, there isn’t much of an argument for other players. He never had the luxury to play next to superstars like KD and Lebron. Teams literally have to triple/quadruple team him just to have a chance at slowing him down.

1,"First, the US is not at war with other countries, they are armed conflicts.  War is only possible when Congress allows it.  A president can authorize armed conflicts up to x amount of days till he has to ask Congress for authorization for more time.  The US Congress has always voted to allow these conflicts to continue.
  
  
Now for the reason to why the US get into armed conflicts.  The initial thought is that resources are the reason, but since globalization resources scarcity has most gone a way for most countries.  Resources still play a role, but they are indirectly involved.  One example is oil, the US does not need to control foriegn oil, but are trade partners do.  The UAE and other countries are extremely concerned with the price of oil and countries which sell oil at a lower price will hurt them financially.  This is one of the reasons the US and Iran are having issues.  It is not about their nuclear technology, but how much oil they are selling.
  
  
Like I said resources still have some sway over the conflicts the US becomes engaged in, but the main driving factor is politics.  Look at China, US, and Russia they are all competing for control of the global market.  China has been very vocal about its currency becoming the defacto currency.  It is attempting to do this by selling infrastructure in developing countries.  These developing countries now have a debt to China and China can influence their economy.
  
  
The US does something similar, but does this with military aid and humanitarian aid.  Some countries ask the US to become involved in their country's sovereignty by requesting assistance against a foreign government.  Ukraine has been asking for assistance against Russia for years but has been denied because well it is Russia.  Another example is the Syria and ISIS.  This was a major geopolitical crisis and I will not attempt to summarize the whole thing, but the short of it... Turkey and neighboring countries were extremely afraid of who ISIS would align with once they had control of Syria, think cold war era concerns.  This is why foreign powers got involved directly.  The hope was that after ISIS was taken care of the Syrian government would be able reestablished itself.
  
  
The final example is when the US gets involved due to humanitarian reasons.  An example of this is Cambodia after its civil war.  The US used its troops to remove civilians after the war ended, because of the known genocide at the time.  This a massive summerization of what was happening at the time.
  
  
The point I am trying to make is resources have no longer been the driving reason for since WW1.  War or armed conflicts are greatly influenced by political interests.  Look at the cold war, most Americans think this was about the spread of communism, but the US was afraid of the USSR sphere of influence.  The whole reason South America is having issues right now is because of the political puppets that were set up during the cold war.

Edit:

Forgot to include something helpful for learning.  Look up commanding heights.  It is both a book is documentarian film.  Real great for explaining how socialism and conflict are shown together."

The 1 trillion in losses is totally true, but that trillion was paid by the ""common American"" , basically the poor class who got worst end of it once more, not only because they literally paid this war but because that trillion could be used to significantly improve their lifes. Meanwhile we have the contractors and the military industry shareholders who got to pocket the majority of this trillion. Check the financial graphs of the biggest US  war industry companies.

That could be true, but I thinks, based on basic human psychology, it is much easier to get recruits if you give them the illusion of choice. Instead of giving the population a direct order(wich could go really badly, cause in that case all the schemes would be much clear,  and so it would be much easier to protest, cause they would have a direct measure to protest against(that why we our criminal systems(punishment)has gotten more hide from the public eyes over time(Read Vigilance and Punishment by Michael Focault). It is much more esiers for the power to give you the illusion of choice that a direct order, it is much more safe. 
Basically the Is government is saying, ""you are not obliged to go the army in any way, only if you want, while at the same time they saying, listen if you go the the army we will give you HealthCare, pay for you college, give you a job, make you a hero and you will get to see the world(just see a typical US army propaganda paper,  they are literally selling a dream)."

1,"I think people are taking somewhat of an antiquated view with this, and I don't think that just because ""it's not harming any workers"" doesn't mean it's entirely acceptable. Piker, as well as most YouTubers, streamers, podcasters etc. make their money off subscriptions and donations, so the more streamers and subscribers you get the more income you're pulling in. Sure, it's mostly if not entirely based on their own work, but it does quickly become a lot of money without much of a price decrease to make content more accessible.

When it comes to content creators oriented towards left-wing content, the point still stands that if they're raking in cash to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars a month (each member of CTH makes between $10k and $20k on Patreon; CumTown makes about as much if not slightly more per person) that if they choose only to use it on themselves, it does raise the question what they're doing it for.

If I were in the position where I was making left-wing content every day and espousing political views that align with the socialist/communist set and I really felt it, I would feel somewhat responsible for ensuring that if the government wasn't taxing me that I was still finding a way to build up my community and contribute to the people who need it as much as possible. The only content creator I know of who actually releases financial reports based on her earnings and how that money is spent is Anita Sarkeesian, and I think if these people want to prove that their money is where their mouth is they should do something similar.

I have no issue if Piker wants to buy a house, my issue is whether or not he's going off about left wing politics while still putting himself first with no regard for his community. That just seems like a grift to me, and the richer some of these people get off their content the more it feels that way. Traditional Marxist analysis won't really apply here when it's a self-employed entertainer accruing large sums of capital - you need to update your analysis with the times you live in."

1,"As I wrote, in the field of economics it is dated, as in it's not very usable. Like many early (or more modern, for that matter) economical theories, it lacks empirical evidence. This doesn't make it untrue, nor that any other theory of value is therefore correct. And as I also wrote, this is also because economics have become a very narrow discipline. But the LTH has to be seen in a more broad social sciences context, to be useful to us.  


Or as David Harvey wrote:  
*""Ricardo’s hope was that the labour theory of value would provide a basis for understanding price formation.  It is this hope that subsequent analysis has so ruthlessly and properly crushed.  Marx early on understood that this was an impossible hope even as he frequently slipped (I suspects for tactical reasons) from values to prices in his presentations as if they were roughly the same thing.""*  


Really, it's somewhat of an un-marxist thing to be married to the idea of the LTB, it was just a general idea that many economists used during the time - it's not something Marx invented or championed. He did use it as a stepping stone to model class relations, and that's what it's interesting for.  


David Harvey concludes with this:  
*""Marx’s value form, I conclude, is not a still and stable fulcrum in capital’s churning world but a constantly changing and unstable metric being pushed hither and thither by the anarchy of market exchange, by revolutionary transformations in technologies and organizational forms, by unfolding practices of social reproduction, and massive transformations in the wants, needs and desires of whole populations expressed through the cultures of everyday life.  This is far beyond what Ricardo had in mind and equally far away from that conception of value usually attributed to Marx.""*

1,"Bush was absolutely NOT a conservative.  He was a globalist wearing a conservative sticker.  We were coming off the shock of having our homeland attacked in a spectacular way which gave way to anger.  Before we knew it, we were involved in a war in Iraq  that spilled over into Afghanistan.   I think a lot of Americans wanted revenge for their loved ones' needless deaths.  

Like Vietnam and Korea, politicians and suits were directing the war instead of letting the commanders on the ground, and the soldiers were supposed to sort of fight them and not destroy them.    

So, in essence, this was not a conservative's war.  This was a war for the amusement of politicians, the bankers, and the war machine.

2) *looks at notebook* no, mostly he just costs ~2.5 times as much so it’s pretty hard to compare"

1,"People get mad about it because the companies are pushing out the activism.

Winning on the ground requires, by necessity, that you challenge the existing ideas, which makes people uncomfortable. This however conflicts with rainbow capitalism, pursuing the profit motive means pursuing the largest possible market.

The profit motive and activism can not coexist. Those pursuing the profit motive actively struggle against the people challenging ideas because the people challenging ideas make others uncomfortable resulting in a smaller market.

This is why you see such a war going on in the lgbt community about companies involving themselves in or coopting Pride - a radical liberation event - instead of making their own events separate to Pride. 

They want to take over Pride and turn it into a profitable fun family day out instead of using it to challenge ideas. They are actively deradicalising and neutering it by pushing out the activists and organisers who defend the radical and defend representing a real challenge to existing ideas and social norms."
0,"I don't think this is a good way to guarantee himself a big wage at his next club - he will not have had any gametime for a full season - there's plenty of other talented 18 year olds around that would be less risky to gamble on, not to mention the money he's asking for is quite significant for just a gamble."
1,"Ok, I disagree with that, but okay. What then would you propose to be our healthcare system in the US? Do we trust health insurance and pharma companies to be completely unregulated? I don’t know, to me, it seems like that would be a disaster for everyone besides the super wealthy. I’d much rather see a single payer system for everyone so that us normal people could get quality healthcare at an affordable price. That is NEVER going to happen without government regulation."

1,"Both my parents grew up in the USSR and they say it really depended on where you were living. For example, in Moscow, most shops were well-stocked however my father lived in the outskirts of a small town and he would occasionally have to travel a fair distance to find a shop with the food they needed. More luxurious items like beer were almost always sold out (especially towards the end of the 1980s), food expiration dates were missing and items would only stop being sold when they became obviously expired.

The USSR didn't go from a perfectly functioning society to rugged capitalism overnight and blankly stating that there was no famine after the start is just false. Even just thinking about that, during the second world war the government adopted a [scorched earth policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_earth) and Soviet soldiers burned crops, dislocated huge amounts of people as they retreated and Stalingrad was a fucking hellhole for 4 years. After this, massive quantities of resources were re-allocated to the cold war and the nuclear program along with proxy wars with America while the western USSR had to recover from the war which took time. During this time there was famine and while it was not as widespread toward the end of the USSR, there were many areas that could not get enough food due to governmental priorities and massive embargos.

Having said that. That wasn't the fault of communism and I completely agree with OP despite me preferring socialism to communism."

0,"I personally think he could have adopted the family name when he was with Luffy's mom. This idea comes from the fact that it seems like Oda has avoided Garp calling Dragon his son, only calling him Luffy's father. The only time Garp even mentioned a child of his was when he was chasing Luffy out of Water Seven, calling Luffy the ""child of my child"", which is such a roundabout way to say grandchild and also weirdly ambiguous to gender. This isnt a translation thing either, even in Japanese he says ""kodomo no kodomo"" which is also roundabout and ambiguous to gender. Also the physical traits Luffy and Garp share don't seem to be shared by Dragon, which makes sense if Luffy gets his looks from his mom instead."
