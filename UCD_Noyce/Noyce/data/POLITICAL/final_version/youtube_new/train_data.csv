This way when they arrive the ground, they're much more than the initial one that entered the Earth. So why are bits change more frequent if we go in a high altitude or in space? Shouldn't they be more frequent on the Earth ground since they become many more by hitting air particles?"

0,Because of the director
0,"I was reluctant to watch this movie because of how bad the first one was but you changed my mind and I'll give it a shot. It's disappointing that HQ is still a dumb character, it would have been great to either see her be the original or have WB do something like in the Batman: Whiteknight comics where there were two Harleys and the Joker was too mentally ill to notice that they were two different people until he took the non approved drugs he stole to treat his mental illness."
0,"I have this take where I from the videos I watched of Filmento and I watched a lot of his videos I think He doest know that much about the stuff he says. He just says things to sound like he knows what he is talking about. And why doesnt he critique when there was something shit about a movie like its not just worst or best movies you can have a movie that is ok but has its flaws but when the people say It was good He says It was good and vice versa I just think the whole Filmento channel is fake and if you understand it good , if you dont then thats your opinion. Well either way you can watch it to kill time . I bet ""why did shang-chi worked where the Black Widow failed "" will be out soon. Oh and I cant wait for the Filmento cult to comment on this

 Sorry so he already made a black widow failed video so my fortune telling will not come true"

0,"Harley Quinn is still annoying in this one, also the first half of the movie was good, but the second half was kinda shit, plus they killed the polka dot man which was one of the only two that had any care in his body for other people(he even remembered milton, i didnt even remember milton) plus they killed him in the dumbest way possible, the movie had some funny humor but it also did alot of the""america bad"" shit that was kinda cringe, the original iron man trilogy showed how to do the evil american government thing in a noncringe manor so did wolverine; the big end fight was very much a let down as only three people actually got involved and one(polkadot man) was instantly killed the moment he finished his arch; the main character bloodsport was almost utterly useless this entire film except in leading at the end and saving ratcatcher 2; the fight between peacemaker and bloodsport was so disapointing, this entire movie they suck each other off trying to prove how cool and prove that they are equal fighting wise and when they started to fight I thought ""wow this is gonna be a cool fight"" but no it lasted 2 seconds and was an utter disapointment, this movie was a step in the right direction for dc but it is still a shit movie(except for polkadot man and milton, they were mvps)"
0,"14:20  I think it's on purpose, Amanda Waller is the real bad guy in the suicide squad"
0,Do they ever explain what happened to the last members of the first suicide squad?
0,"I really like Harley's portrayal here--but I'm a big fan of her stand-along comic series, which is what Birds of Prey and The Suicide Squad seem to be pulling from. She's not an idiot--she just finds it more convenient for people to think she is. At the same time, she's impulsive and works from an emotional center (hence shooting Luna when she saw his ""red flags""). I love Rat Catcher 2, and I genuinely hope we see her character again, and I was surprised how attached I got to both Polka Dot Man and Nanaue by the end. I was really rooting for Polka Dot Man, his sudden death hurt a lot."
0,"It’s only a faint impression, but I got the slightest impression from this video that this commentator is not a huge fan of Waller’s character."
0,:)
0,"Honestly I disagree with you on a key point. Having a movie with a plot that jumps back and forth with the flashback-type events isn’t a bad way to make a movie. Sure a straight progression plot is good and traditionally preferable I personally love the cut back and forth style. That’s not to say the first movie was great but it comes down to preference. People don’t think in linear progression, your mind is constantly flipping back to previous situations and things you know about people or places. It was kinda like seeing into the minds of the slightly crazy characters in the first movie and I wish the second had kept at least a bit of that style"
0,The one thing I liked in Suicide Squad was the villain character Enchantress. I thought the design was cooler than Starro the Destroyer (which was still cool)
0,So that’s not deadshot? It’s bloodsport?
0,"bro i feel so fucking bad for savant
he was assigned to a group with a bunch of losers who couldnt carry a tenth of their own weight, and ran away because there is no reason not to, only to be killed by a devil woman with no moral compass. man literally watched his entire team get massacred to a degree i cannot explain, and knew that he is automatically dead, no matter how you put it. #freesavant"
0,Honestly I was a little bummed after cap boomerang was killed (Him being the only aussie in the bunch so I could kinda relate to him) but after seeing the rest of the movie I realised this was the only way he could actually fit in to the movie. And I enjoyed the movie a lot
0,"So I didn't watch the new Suicide Squard. I thought it would be just as silly as the first one. I'm only 2:45 in, and I'm getting the impression the new one was way better than the old one. I'm not gonna watch any more of this vid till I see the movie"
0,"Hearing John Cena say
""I don't care how many men, woman, and children I need to kill to get it"" hits different"

0,I didn’t even like the first movie but that title makes literally 0 sense and ngl legitimately makes you sound special in the head. Like bike helmet wearing kinda special.
0,yo your mic peakin
0,You spoiled the whole movie!!! No spoiler warning
0,I actually liked the first suicide squad better than the new one.
0,"This movie was so much better, because it didn't take itself so seriously."
0,Polka dot man is irrelevant and that's why they made his death so insignificant
0,"This was legitimately my first time seeing hobbits next to other characters and I’m losing it at how small they are
Anyways this video is helpful and I’ll keep it in mind when writing stories"
0,well also helps that the movie wasn't dark 80%of the time
0,"Theres no violence if theres noone to be violent with
-Peacemaker"
0,"I really feel this joker would've been interesting If they made him a broken robin, a billionaire's adopted kid trained by batman who got turned by the joker. It would've worked so perfectly on paper specially the way Ben Affleck wanted his batman to be (for example Bale's batman or any other batman it just wouldn't work because of the playboy side, but Afflecks batman was a broken billionaire who lost a son, the stubborn version of batman that always fights with Jason. It could've really worked)
Think about it, the tattoos would make sense he is a billionaire's kid trying to act gangster while also being a legitimate threat. Anything weird or goofy looking can be explained as the joker turning this kid into something batman hates, something that billionaire Bruce Wayne would never accept.
 How do you make robin/joker a threat? Killing the real joker and having batman as a father.
Batman would never kill his own child and even if he does want to it can be explained as batman wanting to stop his son at all costs (an evil mini batman/ mini joker baby is very dangerous to be left alive, the joker is unpredictable but batman knows this so he thinks outside of the box, how do you stop something that thinks like batman but acts like the joker?). What a wasted opportunity."
0,"batman vs superman, haley quin vs the army... well fuck logic"
0,"To be fair, TDK's name in the comics is ""Arm Fall-Off Boy"" then later ""Splitter"", so not even DC diehards would've recognized him."
0,The reason it worked was because they stayed the hell out of the way and let James Gunn do his thing.
0,the fact that it ended with a bunch of rats eating a giant space starfish makes it a 10/10 in my book
0,"Say what you will about this movie, it looks terrible in my opinion, the CGI makes me want to gouge my eyes out."
0,"I think if they portrayed Harley Quinn as a figure with more agency, rather than a hypercompetant dimwit, she'd be more engaging (at least to me). I don't hate Harley Quinn as she is but I think if they showed her as more of a figure that uses her goofy and unpredictable demeanor to get what she wants, she'd be a lot more respectable and would make sense with her status as a doctor. I don't mean go completely stonefaced once she has what she wants, but just the sense that her zaney personality is also tactical. It would encourage me more to see Birds of Prey."
0,Bruh all you had to say was they now have a better director😂
0,"Lol the original was 10x better than this stupid shit,,did u watch both the movies lol"
0,"I hate the current stile of Harley Quinn where she is betrayed as an idiot, sure she may have some problems but she has a PhD in psychology she isn't dumb"
0,Impressive film reviews. You’ve got skill. Movie companies should use you to vet their scripts.
0,"I disagree on your take on harley quinn, which is actually rare, I love ALL of your stuff and learnt so much from you. However, I think that harley's escape sequence is one of the best harley quinn representations I've seen in a while. Remaking her whole character after coming from suicide squad and birds of prey was hard, so keeping her core as a crazy young girl who plays dumb was the start. So how you make that interesting? Make her a proactive and competent character. She likes the hot rich asshole? She shows that after her deal with the joker she learnt to read red flags and avoid them. She gets captured? She plays dumb and crazy until she can ambush the guard and break free. She's surrounded by guards? she shows to be as deadly as our main characters Bloodsport and Peacemaker.  A teammate about mess up (polka dots blasting the guards near the explosives)? Show that she really plays dumb, but is actually aware of the situation, and her quick reflex saves polka dots life.  Need to give a character arc to a static character? Giver her a joke MacGuffin that ends up saving her life and being key to defeat the obligatory big cgi monster.

All this gives us a proactive character who's as smart, extremely competent and deadly, while also remaining true to the core of this dcu harley quinn of being innocent and crazy. The one moment where she's shown to be vulnerable was when Flag told her they were going to rescue her. And it was really sad, the way she hugged him coupled with her previous badassery really made me care for her character, and when she used the javelin to stab starro's eye I was cheering for her."
0,"Wait people actually thought this movie was good? I mean maybe compared to the first one, but as a movie on its own it was just garbage"
0,Tbh I like how the suits seem weird in the modern movies
0,"I think what makes this better is that The Suicide Squad doesn’t take itself seriously. When you look at it from afar, the concept of villains doing good sounds pretty weird, so seeing it take a dark, edgy turn makes it seem pretty dumb. But when you take these characters who didn’t belong it that dark genre, and put them in a movie where everyone is just having fun, it has a drastic difference that is much better."
0,"I was really sad for Starro. It's last words were ""I was happy floating and looking at the stars.""
It had no intention of being a conqueror or a destroyer of any kind until it was captured and tortured for 30yrs."
0,Huh I felt like the The Suicide Squad was a sequal to Suicide Squad...
0,"""Peacemaker. What a joke,"" and I hit my table when I heard that because the pun is too strong in this one."
0,"Oh, I thought this movie managed to make Amanda Wallwr hilarious. The perfect straight man. When the camera panned to her face after Peacemaker went ""What does he do, shoot polka dots?"" I lost it.  Or the way she stared down her employee when he didn't check to see if Weasel could swim."
0,What do you mean the first one was great
0,Nah the new film was woke trash.
0,um for me Suicide Squad is WAY better!
0,That guy going full bitch mode after seeing the slaughter made no sense.
0,The Suicide  Squad was the product of the best Weed and Acid known to man... Suicide Squad was a man on meth trying to write and direct at the same time... Not saying that Ayer never made anything good... But Gunn's better.
0,i personally didn't like the new suicide squad at all but polka dot man and king shark were the ones who motivated me to sit through the movie

0,He didn’t even mention the best character: Milton
0,I hate how Hollywood has portrayed harley especially since her original design in the comics is just batman with jokers ideals.
0,These comparisons involving the Suicide Squad movies are really just unnecessary and fickle. Both movies are good in their own right. The first one had more of a serious tone whereas the second one had a more comedic heartfelt tone.
0,i am sorry i see your point but dont call king shark killer shark like come on
0,"I would die for King Shark 
He is so wholesome"
0,Do they succeed? Lol the second was trash. Only thing I liked was poka for man and the shark.. the first was good  it was a decent storyline and was the suicide squad.. the second one just threw away the first cast members or killed them easily... they should have continued it...
0,"Gonna be honest, you lost me when you said that the Snyder cut was an improvement of the original. The only thing it added was some cyborg stuff but the rest was worse and less consistent with the universe it is meant to be placed in...."
0,i like both i dont know why u think different its just showing everything as well as people so both are great
0,this movie made the best your mom joke ever lol

0,Sad young legend in the prime die young rip never knew him and “Jordan” to say what he did is a outstanding respectful guy
0,They should make a movie about this guy! I would so watch it.  so much crap about aliens and zombies and super heroes when we had real human beings that were heroically larger than life. What a tragic end to his life but his legacy lives on!

0,"Those were incredible times in the NBA.
I remember there was a saying at the time.
'I went to a fight, and a basketball game broke out'.
The competitive tension in the early 90's was so high, that player were constantly fighting.  And not only each other but on an occasion a fan or two.
It got so bad that the NBA adopted a zero tolerance policy on fighting.
Players were kicked out of games, and suspended for multiple games.
And that's when they increased the levels of fouls, and their punishments.
It was getting out if hand, but it was exciting to watch.
And it was disruptive to the game.
So they clearly needed to do something to curb the escalation between players.
MJ could take it and handle it.
And luckily for Pippen, Jordan was there to keep him calm.  Scotty was a hot head when pushed.

But Fun Times none the less."
0,He's determine great player that's good to never give up

0,"Thanks for the video,  grew up watching this era NBA with my dad, didn't know about this man."
0,Haha... they lost every game. Nice try.
0,Trailblazer fan here. I was lucky enough to watch Drazen play live. I remember the night he was traded. We used to go where the Blazers parked and get autographs from them as they left. Some nights they would not sign anything for us. The night Drazen was traded he stood there and signed for every person who asked him. It was great to watch. It wasn't until the next morning we learned he was traded. He really was a wonderful person.
0,Y’all see lebron hair?
0,"Scared or not scared, MJ beat you."
0,"Petrovic on Gallis "" I would like to play in the same team with Gallis, so that I pass the ball to him and just enjoy watching him score "" 

The idea that Petrovic was just an egomaniac is wrong. He was highly respectable of worhty opponents. He often said he was the 2nd best European player after Gallis. But us Greeks consider him to be on a par."

0,"Guinness (and other beers) served on tap in the UK is pressurized with nitrogen and carbon dioxide, which in turn forms nitrous oxide. You ever spray a can of whipped cream into your mouth? Taste how when the whipped cream is gone but there is some sweet gas coming out? That sweet tasting gas is nitrous oxide. It's what makes Guinness have such a thick and creamy head, as opposed to artificially carbonated canned beer like Coors light or whatever. 
When you open the can of Guinness, the change in ambient pressure causes the ball to rupture, releasing the nitrogen into the beer which already contains the carbon dioxide. Voila! Just like it was poured from a tap in a pub.
Interesting side note; Guinness contains much less alcohol than other beers. If you want a beer with lunch (or before work), that's the one to choose.

1,"The Christo-fascists on the right sound SO cringey when they try to sound intelligent about racism. For one thing, they're white supremacists who don't think that racism exists except for all of the ""reverse racism"" claims that they've made in their inexhaustible quest for victimhood. They're also still using the 1950's playbook on what is/isn't racist. To their credit, their outdated understanding of racism means that SOME of them legitimately don't know how tone-deaf and hateful they sound."
1,Well I agree with Pelosi on one thing: I don't like them either.

Of course Pelosi is a racist; Of course she hates the poor and other commoners, the same way slave owners looked upon the people they whipped as animals who didn't feel pain the way humans did.

The word Trump will always be remembered as the time of lies ! America makes the lack of ethics in speech again a criminally prosecutable law! those same laws we had for almost 100 years slander and liability,, What happened to those ethical laws? why did the republicans change those laws? Here is why! FOX NEWS this Russian TV program, owned by the Russians, and made by Russia, would never have been legal in America without the end of our ethical laws!

1,"These ignorant republicans don't realize that the Fox news YouTube comment section is composed of a bunch of losers on fake YouTube accounts complaining to a bunch of other losers who are on their fake youtube accounts. 800 comments is really just 200 losers on multiple YouTube accounts. These losers stay anonymous because for some reason they think the government is tracking their insignificant, complete waste of space lives. These are all the same people who didn't show up to vote in their own state but then drove all the way to Washington DC on January 6th to stop the steal, lol!😃

  Ever notice how fox new turns off all comments when dealing with race? That's because even Fox news knows you are all a bunch racist and will leave racist comments. There is only one race and that's the human race. There are no racists in Heaven, its sad I have to say that.
    Also these are the same people who love their guns and the second amendment. These people don't realize that if they had faith in God they wouldn't need guns. Complete cowards, all of them."

1,An appeals court suspended Rudy Giuliani from practicing law in New York on Thursday because he made false statements while trying to get courts to overturn Donald Trump’s loss in the presidential race.

1,"One of President Donald Trump’s lesser known but profoundly damaging legacies will be the explosive rise in the national debt that occurred on his watch. The financial burden that he’s inflicted on our government will wreak havoc for decades, saddling our kids and grandkids with debt.

The national debt has risen by almost $7.8 trillion during Trump’s time in office. That’s nearly twice as much as what Americans owe on student loans, car loans, credit cards and every other type of debt other than mortgages, combined, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It amounts to about $23,500 in new federal debt for every person in the country.

The growth in the annual deficit under Trump ranks as the third-biggest increase, relative to the size of the economy, of any U.S. presidential administration, according to a calculation by a leading Washington budget maven, Eugene Steuerle, co-founder of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. And unlike George W. Bush and Abraham Lincoln, who oversaw the larger relative increases in deficits, Trump did not launch two foreign conflicts or have to pay for a civil war.


Economists agree that we needed massive deficit spending during the COVID-19 crisis to ward off an economic cataclysm, but federal finances under Trump had become dire even before the pandemic. That happened even though the economy was booming and unemployment was at historically low levels. By the Trump administration’s own description, the pre-pandemic national debt level was already a “crisis” and a “grave threat.”

The combination of Trump’s 2017 tax cut and the lack of any serious spending restraint helped both the deficit and the debt soar. So when the once-in-a-lifetime viral disaster slammed our country and we threw more than $3 trillion into COVID-19-related stimulus, there was no longer any margin for error.

Our national debt has reached immense levels relative to our economy, nearly as high as it was at the end of World War II. But unlike 75 years ago, the massive financial overhang from Medicare and Social Security will make it dramatically more difficult to dig ourselves out of the debt ditch.

Falling deeper into the red is the opposite of what Trump, the self-styled “King of Debt,” said would happen if he became president. In a March 31, 2016, interview with Bob Woodward and Robert Costa of The Washington Post, Trump said he could pay down the national debt, then about $19 trillion, “over a period of eight years” by renegotiating trade deals and spurring economic growth.

After he took office, Trump predicted that economic growth created by the 2017 tax cut, combined with the proceeds from the tariffs he imposed on a wide range of goods from numerous countries, would help eliminate the budget deficit and let the U.S. begin to pay down its debt. On July 27, 2018, he told Sean Hannity of Fox News: “We have $21 trillion in debt. When this [the 2017 tax cut] really kicks in, we’ll start paying off that debt like it’s water.”"
