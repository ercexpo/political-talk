1,Amazing cop
1,Why aren't people  talking about on how calm the cops are
0,You cant reason with a person that has no reason.
1,Hesuck in his mental health
1,"WHY do police officers have to tell armed dangerous criminals to put their damned weapons down 2-4 dozen times? Tell them once. If they don't comply, then they are choosing lawful disobedience and they should be shot."
0,Just a little bit higher n u wudhave had his arm mate
1,"when civilians get hurt in these situations it's not the fault of the police. probably could have gassed this guy too.... 7.5 billion people in the world, who's the next nutcase? step right up."
1,Everyone is lucky the taser worked; often they don't.  This would have had a much different outcome otherwise.  Odd that the bad guy had the deadly weapons and the police had just a taser.  Not good.
0,"He really wasn't much of a threat,I could of easily disarm him with one arm behind my back, Chuck Norris style."
0,He would be dead if he came at me with those knifes no questions ask.
1,Over in th UK  the police  have one defense     against the bad guys running  away........They yell  STOP !!!.....Or I will say STOP  again......LOL.......no guns ... that's a joke......LOL
1,I dont believe  in the use   of Tasers ......its simple ....it should be like the old days.....the police say put  down the knife   you follow  orders .....if you dont drop the knife  and  try to attack  the police they shoot  you!!!......no stupid  bean bag rounds either ....just shoot the guy...period!!!!.....LOL
1,Now this video will probably be used as example of Police violence or something according to some radical SJWS etc lol

0,Very poor tactics on their part.  The cops got lucky...
1,"i absolutely would agree with use of lethal force in this case. why should that officer die, he was not far away from being stabbed"
1,Police officers shouldn't have to be put into this much danger.  Obviously this wasn't in the USA.
0,Hey mate if I buy you dinner & give you complimentary reach around will you put the knives down?
0,"Policia estupido una sola puñalada y lo matan, mucho riesgo"

1,"Those police officers are absolute heroes, and deserve every ounce of respect."
0,Call Him The Knife man
1,"Those police officers need two receive bravery award as well as professional approach where they de-escalate, instead of escalate situation like most nervous cops do."
0,"They definitely need to increase the voltage in those things. He obviously wanted to die, that was clear."
0,Thats exactly how they come at with a knife.
0,Big bools !
1,UK POLICE ARE WEAK PUSSYS
1,Officer in the US would've lit him up with a AR-15
1,this video should be shown to all cop trainees under the title: how to regain trust and respect from the public...
1,lesson learned london police super polite usa that guy woulda died maybe they can catch a lesson themselves
0,He wants to carve up the piggy make some Chicharons
0,"Wow. A more determined attacker could have stuck him in the gut. That could’ve been really really bad. 
Glad luck was on their side. He’s lucky they didn’t call armed officers in and that he didn’t stab one of those officers."
1,why didnt they just opened the door fast and threw gaz grenade than shut it it. less risky for the police and the knifer dude.
0,Should consider himself lucky to still be breathing after a stunt like that.

What's so troubling is that if a normal person off the street did this they would be executed for High Crimes against Humanity and Treason."

The plane was so heavily laden with greed, graft and corruption it could hardly take off."
1,"WOW! It is all over for Democrats, and biden now!  Yeah, right. Lying is the Democrats natural language. Truth is as far from them as the East is from the West. What is old Ron Johnson going to do, wash their mouths out with soap? Make them write 100 times"" I shall not lie ""? Give them a good spanking, and send them to their rooms? He isn`t going to do anything except bloviate, and look all flustered, and bothered. He should order them to be handcuffed, and legs shackled, then drug out by their feet, thrown into solitary confinement and left there for six months before any legal proceedings are started. That would open the eyes of every Democrat hack in Washington, DC, then you would see the rats abandoning ship in droves."

0,You think? 🙄
1,The Democrat criminals have the protection of the FBI
1,"Even though this article might be a little negative what they're saying on the news of Fox business.I hopefully it's not true.Anyways Hunter Biden looks just like his father Joe Biden except the younger version of him.Two good looking guys, yep!!!! One is a grandpa, which is Joe Biden.Hunter Biden I think is a father. Hey Hunter Biden you look just like your daddy, in it is younger years of Joe Biden!!!! 
P.S. word of advice.If Joe Biden needs help speaking on a national TV. The people from news Fox Business should give him a teleprompter or script to read from to make it easier for Joe Biden.If they don't like the way Joe Biden speaks on TV. Anyways I think Joe Biden has a nice family. They seem like they're nice people but I don't know for sure. Joe Biden kind of reminds me of my grandfather. I think the people in government should help Joe Biden manage the White House better so that he's doing his job more correctly and efficiently in all areas of the government. The bottom line is 
I think they all need to work together the Republicans and the Democrats, to be on the same page,to get things done the right way,amen. I really miss my grandpa tremendously,!!!! Take care, best of wishes to you's. I just hope and pray that everything works itself out but the people in the government to work together not against each other. P.S. My grandfather would say two hands make light work.With that being said everybody needs to put their minds together all politicians,Democrats,the Republicans,and etc people to get things really accomplished there in the White House of government in Washington DC.
Well anyways have a great day,!!!! God Bless You's All White House Government There in Washington DC. I really hope things get better with our country in all areas of government, no matter who's in charge,amen. Keep America safe,& well protected on all sides of the government, and the border completely because we need it. I really hope that everything works for the best here in the United States and around the world. Really Amen,&Amen."

1,The bidens are a living lie
1,"Four years of Trump lying on a daily basis and NOW the RNC starts to care about the truth.

The hypocrisy is astonishing."
1,"It's a travesty for sure.  PR 101 says you come out and face the public sooner rather later.  If Biden came out and stated he exercised poor judgement when he threatened to withhold American $Billions unless the prosecutor was removed, he might gain some respect.  Not from me of course, but from his base.  As it stands, once republicans gain control of the Congress in 2022, Impeachment proceedings will be filed.  The likelihood that Joe can even remember any of this is scary NO."
1,Cought Biden in a lie ??? It's more unusual for him to tell the truth!!

0,L'u'nch mob
1,Of course nobody says anything about the child porn guess it’s ok if your a democrat. Biden is guilty of so many crimes yet DOJ doesn’t do anything. How about lying to get a gun then losing it. How about flying all over the world in Air Force 1 meeting with spy’s. Yet this family is allowed to be president. But the DOJ is a joke Obama was guilty of even more yet they don’t even investigate.

1,Biden should keep the fences up and the troops surrounding the White House and congress bc it’s “gunna b” a bumpy four year ride.
1,Twitter and Facebook permanently banned me for reposting joe’s and hunters pedophila photos. Why is pedophila acceptable to democrats?

Pat won't be running again from what I hear. Just as well. I don't for the life of me understand WHY when the Democrats didn't even apologize along with the Media for 1. Wasting the tax payers money on needless investigations on you when you were doing such a great job. #2. Why didn't You have them held accountable for the Slander, misleading the Americans, treasonous acts , endangering our lives for their own agendas. Pelosi is seen in a video .when a reporter asked her Why didn't Congress  let the Stimulus go through when the Trump Administration first created it before the Holidays when so many families were in dire need  yet NOW after the holidays they did. She simply said Well there's a different President!!! how about that? No care for the poor families that desperately were trying to  have a Holiday for their children , that were maybe laid off , behind in their rent, worried about putting food on the table or if they'd be going back to work  . Pelosi held us hostage to make it look like it went through under the Biden Administration. That takes a very deranged , desperate human being to that.. i can go on here but i'm getting sick over it. I think the Republicans let them get away with way too much."

As a transwoman with a checkered past of illicit drug consumption and participation in all that comes with it, PLEASE help change drug law policies. 

Harm reduction is the best approach to helping the world reduce the carnage brought about by criminalizing the health issues of dependence/addiction. The fact that drugs are readily available in prisons, should be a clue as to how the drug war has been permanently won, by drugs.

I survived using Boy, girl, rock and raw on the streets of Baltimore's West Side. The best way to help is to offer pure medical grade heroin to maintenance people. This would bring people addicted to opiates under the wings of medical personnel. Saving people from the streets. 

The DEA sucks billions of tax dollars, pumps people with addictions straight into the private prison industry, to build $8,000.00 desks for people like South Dakota Governor Kirsti Noem. Isn't that special?

No, try, disgusting. Surely none of those sweet bikers at Sturgis were using drugs. 😕 But you know, they don't  live in the projects, where the bad people are...hunted...daily.

We lost a wonderful actor when Michael K. Williams passed. We will lose thousands more people today. Tomorrow. And on and on.

Only 321 people have commented here. Please  share this person's death and what harm reduction, all drug decriminalization, drug maintenance programs can do to save lives.

It may be someone you loves turn to die next."

And even if a driver is sued, Uber and Lyft's legal departments have probably advised their Board of Directors and executives that such a case would likely be easily dismissed.    I don't think there is any precedent for this and they know that.

What are the damages even?  Some random person is just going to sue some lyft driver for a gazillion dollars because they drove somebody else to an abortion clinic?

Also republicans: You can ban a woman from getting an abortion because even though it is their body, it is not their choice.

If abortion is murder, then isn't allowing people to put others at risk of getting sick and dying because of their ignorance murder too?

Also, I have every confidence that most judges would consider any law that punishes a driver for taking someone somewhere without knowing if the person is committing a crime or not, to be unconstitutional, or at the very least has no legal ground to stand on."
1,"""Consider a scenario where you are a perfect bone marrow match for a child with severe aplastic anemia; no other person on Earth is a close enough match to save the child's life, and the child will certainly die without a bone marrow transplant from you.""

""If you decided that you did not want to donate your marrow to save the child, for whatever reason, the state cannot demand the use of any part of your body for something to which you do not consent. It doesn't matter if the procedure required to complete the donation is trivial, or if the rationale for refusing is flimsy and arbitrary, or if the child is a genius or a saint or anything else - the decision to donate must be voluntary to be constitutional.""

""This right is even extended to a person's body after they die; if they did not voluntarily commit to donate their organs while alive, their organs cannot be harvested after death, regardless of how useless those organs are to the deceased or how many lives they would save. That's the law.""

""Use of a woman's uterus to save a life is no different from use of her bone marrow to save a life - it must be offered voluntarily.""

""By all means, profess your belief that providing one's uterus to save the child is morally just, and refusing is morally wrong. That is a defensible philosophical position, regardless of who agrees and who disagrees. But legally, it must be the woman's choice to carry out the pregnancy.""

""She may choose to carry the baby to term. She may choose not to. Either decision could be made for all the right reasons, all the wrong reasons, or anything in between.

1,"Another nice piece of work, Chris. However, let's be honest. Kayleigh, DJT and most of the GOP are literally a ""Falsehood Factory"" of epic proportions, providing a very target-rich environment for journalists in need of unsavory characters to report about. Still, your videos are always much appreciated."
1,This accusation about anyone coming out of CNN is kinda hilarious tho.
1,"Daily reminder: Trump punked out over 6,000 service member and contractors (losers and fools to him) who died to support the democratically elected government of Afghanistan.


⁍ Trump surrendered AF to a terrorist organization without the permission of the  democratically  elected government.

⁍ He constantly capitulated while they only met 1/4 of their terms.

⁍ Trump transferred all of the military equipment before January 15 - Biden became president on January 20th

⁍ Trump forced the Afghans to spring 5,000 high value POWs who controlled 70% of the country with Al Qaeda

⁍ Trump and Steph Miller completely wrecked the (SIV) and trapped our allies. Americans should have left on their own. They put our service members in danger 

⁍ In 2020 Congress withheld funding for troop withdrawals without informing the public about Afghan army desertions, government stability, and police readiness. He broke the law and reduced troops to 2500

⁍ Biden had two choices: Disregard the trump surrender resulting in American hostages, beheadings, and service casualties or do what he did GET US OUT

⁍ Trump could have done the job if that was his goal. Instead he set the end date well (100 days) into the next administration to hamstring his successor, cause political damage, and reap power from chaos just like his brothers the Taliban do with suicide bombs"

1,Compared to Psaki she is an oracle of truth. So no insurrection according to the FBI. No migrant crisis at the border. Covid deaths still climbing for Biden. No disasterous withdrawal from Afghanistan.  Chris you’re gaslighting if anyone is.
1,"why not call it what it is, propaganda...initial steps to a fascist state...attack the press, repeat the same lie over and over again, claim (false) patriotism, etc.  we are in a very serious situation...don't forget Hitler was a elected official... this isnt politics as usual, this is a fight for what semblance we have of a democracy."

Biden has done all the above in 8 months, I think cnn's gaslight ran out of gas probably from this dweeb chris huffing it all"
1,KAYLY MAGA-NANNY
1,"You really have to give it up for collective group thought of imbeciles. Will deny that they made a mistake with Biden all the way up to being inturned in camps and actually having to speak Chinese. It won't be the $8 a gallon that they'll be paying in a year or the fact that the dollar is not worth less than $0.50, oh no they're a special kind of brainwashed unapologetic arrogant stupid."
1,"Okay. CNN. These videos with their silly sound effects, #HipMemes, cheesy jokes, and stock music in the background are so incredibly bad. It looks like a really bad YouTube channel, but it says fucking CNN on it. How are YouTube channels doing this better than you?

Not to mention missing an opportunity to list the myriad of crisis' during the Trump administration. I understand you don't have hours to go through them all, but just hitting the ones that everyone remembers that Republicans would handwave away? This is Fox News' competition? You are failing at your only job."

0,She should because its true.
1,"The big chaotic items Chris listed were mostly political measures manufactured by democrats (Ukraine impeachment? Give me a freaking break!!!). The only real bad decision by Trump was easing up on the COVID restrictions when democrats called him racist for doing so. Our Country was was on an incredible glide path before Wuhan leaked the ‘Rona upon us all. In 8 months Biden has far more serious errors in judgment than Trump in four years. It’s really not even close. BTW, I’m a political moderate who voted Trump in ‘16, then Biden in ‘20."

On the other hand: trump is just so badasss that he should be in jail since day 1. But nothing is really happening to him…… even under joes admin, they still can’t put him into jail, so what is the point to keep reporting negative things about him?"
