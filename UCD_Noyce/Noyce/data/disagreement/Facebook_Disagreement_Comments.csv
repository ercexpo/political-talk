That caused the tragedies in most cases (there were war-crime sex-violence in the front line and occupied area by the Japanese army , but the trials and executions were done already). That's the main reason why Japanese government, since early 1990's, expressed apologies many times for the victims of this system and in 1994 founded ""the Asian Women's Fund"" for the surviving ex-comfort women of several countries and afforded compensation with apology letter of the prime minister of Japan and supported medical expenses for more than ten years since its foundation (the follow-up operation lasted until 2016) in several countries including South Korea (For 285 women from Philippines, Taiwan and South Korea. 79 from Netherlands. Not personally specified projects in Indonesia as Indonesian government did not accept personal compensation). 60 Korean ex-comfort women received the compensation money and the medical support but some denied it(The reason was that the 40% of the compensation and medical support<about 45 thousand US$ each> was from the fund raising among the Japanese citizens and not totally governmental).So for the final solution, in December, 2015, Japan and Korea reached the agreement for those ex-comfort women support, expressing the apology from the prime minister of Japan.

Firstly, the whole point of a section is that it is often against the wishes of both the patient and families. Families don't 'let' it happen- they have no choice. It only happens if the patient is deemed too unwell to be managed in society and lots of people are involved in making that decision. 
Secondly, mental health wards really aren't the scary places people think they are.
