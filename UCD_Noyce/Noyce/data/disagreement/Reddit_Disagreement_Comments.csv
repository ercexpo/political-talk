My short answer for how I would change the US system, (or how I would like to see my state legislature work, if numbers were adjusted)

I like the bicameral system and think it creates an oppertunity.

* Senate: Simple Instant Runoff Voting with one winner, and keep terms the same.

* House: 
1)  Have multi candidate districts out of which four representatives are elected, using a multi candidate Single Transferrable Vote method. 
2) Up the number of representatives in the house of representatives to 1000.

Now here is the long explanation of why I think this is the best system.

First we need to look at the goal of represenation.  In my mind we are trying to take the complex and scattered views throughout the country, have representatives that can speak on behalf of those views, and then create the best compromise policies possible by looking at the totality of these different viewpoints.

* Remember originally in the United States Senators were not elected.  It was not mandatory to have senators elected until the 17th amendment in 1913.  The concept was that you would have state interests represented by the appointment of senators by the state (who were elected by the voting public), and then you would have the house which was the direct voice of the people.  The idea was different viewpoints would create better policy.  I am not suggesting going back to this but think it is important when considering what the purpose of having two legislative bodies is, if both are elected the same way.

* The system of voting in my new Senate is IRV, which has been explained throughout this forum.  Here are two videos if you don't know what it is.  
[Explained with every day life example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtW3QkX8Xa0)

 [Explained in a more traditional way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FstA45lxgFs)

Now what effect does this have on the kinds of candidates elected, and the kinds of campaigns run?  Well it means that the candidates elected tend to be more moderate (I know sad for many of us, but that is where the house of reps comes in).  Because we take out the smallest supported candidates first, and let them go to their second choice until a candidate has achieved a majority, we ensure that the candidate is one that is favored at least to some extent, by at least half the population.  Meanwhile voters now can express their preference for smaller parties by voting for them in their early choices which allows these issues to not only gain visability, but gives the more mainstream or popular candidates a chance and a strategic reason to want to court these votes in order to become their second or third choice.  This is also how this system can lead to less negative campaigning.

So we have candidates that should approximate the political center of there state in the senate who have been elected by courting minority or single issue party views that seem to resonate with voters.  Sound good right?

*Now we move onto the house.

The house has a less talked about election scheme, although it is actually similar to the preferential voting used in IRV, and thus the actual way you vote will be completely consistent.
The way this system differs is that you are no longer cutting out the smallest candidates until there is one candidate with a majority, instead we will cut small candidates until we have 4 candidates each with more than 20% of the vote.  
Here is a video to show how this works [Gummy Bears Voting!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=887sGavI9kY)

This system gives minority representation, as any candidate popular enough to achieve 20% support in a district can be a representative. 

What this means is that now you would have socialists, libertarians, greens, constitution party, working families party, neocon's, business parties, evangelicals, and ideologies of all stripes represented throughout the districts in the country.  These different groups would come together in congress, forming Caucasus's most of the time with no single party able to pass legislation on its own.  Instead the issues that would be passed, would be those that parties could come to agree on.  This means that different kinds of issues would be talked about, pushed, and would be able to pass the house than normally rise to the top of american politics.  Look at issues that cut the political parties, Physician Assisted Suicide laws for example.  Libertarians (who tend to be republicans) tend to like these laws, as do many liberals, yet more mainstream democrats are more warry.  Under our system that means no one wants to touch this issue as it alienates them from their base.  The only states that have the law passed it through referendum, with little support by established politicians.  Other examples are Marijuana legalization, cutting defense spending, and many others.  I find it easier to think of policies I support, but this would really create an environment where many policies I don't like would gain traction as well, however I think it is a better democratic process.
So to counter the moderate nature of the Senate, we instead have voting districts which ensure that in each region many viewpoints can be represented.  (Right now Rural Democrats and Urban Republicans have little voice).  This makes the house the inovative body, coming up with solutions and legislation while the senate ensures nothing to crazy gets passed.

* Now onto why I would up the house to 1000.  It comes down to campaign financing.  This election system in general makes it more difficult for moneyed interests to get their way.  Under the current system it is easy to pick winners in an election, and easy for moneyed interests to get involved in primaries early to ensure sympathetic candidates rise to the top.  However to do this to all four winning candidates is much more difficult, as each one only needs 20% of their district to support them to win.  It is much easier to get 20% through grassroots efforts, than it is to get 50%.  There are a million things to say about how having more candidates and lower winning threshold would effect campaign money, but I don't want to get to bogged down in it, and instead ask that you think about it yourself as it isn't that hard to figure out.

Now the 1000 house members.  If the purpose of lobbying and putting big money into politics is to buy/influence/gain sympathetic votes, then one way to make this much more difficult is add dramatically more votes.  If one congressmen is only one vote of 435 and maybe one of a handful on an important committee, then that is a much more valuable position to buy than if they are 1 in 1000, and one of 2 handfuls in a committee.  This makes lobbying a hell of a lot more expensive, and that is in a first past the post system, in this multi candidate STV system it would have even more of an impact.
In my mind this means more decisions will be made on the merits of the question at hand rather than pissing off the wrong people for reelection concerns.


TL DR;
Moderate senate acts as gatekeeper to a house of representatives that has political opinions all over the map in a way that more closely represents the views of voters in each district.  In addition money in politics would be less influential.

After some reassuring that I'd be home, I hung up agitated.

Needless to say, I was tired, frustrated and ready to call it a night when I got a phone call from one of the employees in the office. She said she too was staying late and asked if it would be ok to try one of the cigars that I had hand rolled for the office. 

I never paid much attention to this employee because she was rather new and was pretty much a glorified intern. She wasn't a looker, but she was always down to party. Everyone in the office loved her because she was the life of the party.

Anyway, I say ""sure, have at it."" and she offered to light me one too. ""What the hell?"" I responded. It was already late and my wife was most likely already asleep so wouldn't miss me if I stuck around for another hour, smoking a cigar. 

This is where things got strange. So the intern comes knocks on my door as I'm shutting down the computer and packing up my things. I open up and she goes ""All lit and ready sir!"" At this point I was pretty much used to being called sir, but this was a first. She stood there with two cigars in hands in nothing but a company t-shirt.

My mouth dropped and I stumbled to get out ""This... this is not what I was expecting."" Before I even had a chance to stammer out that sentence, she takes the tubo and says ""Now that I hid it, are you ready to find it?""

Your experience of Houston will more likely be the Rice experience. The people of the Rice community are some of the brightest, most diverse, and most individualistic you'll find anywhere in the world. You will find the most engaging conversation and the most imaginative parties, all with people that are really serious about their academic disciplines. But that also means you will be subjected to people with the traits that compliments those behaviors: neurosis, mania, exclusion, and depression. 

You will be judged, for better or for worse; it just won't be because of your sexual preference. You just have to shrug that stuff off and embrace the rigor and magic. Being gay is only a problem in the suburbs, and in particular, the older, working-class suburbs with high penetration of practiced religion.* 

Because of the location of campus, Rice students without roots in Houston may miss some of the best parts of this city. It's in an affluent area with a fair degree of cultural homogeneity. I recommend befriending some locals that can help you explore. 

Doing so will not only provide you with broader exposure to the city, but may also help you ignore Houston's largest fault: poor access to public transportation. ""Close"" means something different in Houston than it does in other large cities. Even though the Rice campus is situated on the rail system, it's a 10-20 minute walk from most parts of campus to get to the train, and most of what you'd want to do will be another 10-20 minutes off the rail or a bus transfer away. All in all, it can take an hour or more to get someplace that would be 7 minutes by car. Don't let that discourage you; it just means you will have to be a little flexible if you don't have a car. 

As for music, Rice hosts some great shows, and there are a lot of venues nearby (by Houston standards). Post specific genres and we can respond with some recommendations. The arts community and gay community both center around a neighborhood called the Montrose, which is connected to Rice by the museum district. Following the same corridor a little farther down you'll find the Heights. Arts venues are scattered throughout these areas, and many of them are multi-purpose.

You say candidates will need to be centrist to win but in FPTP candidates fight to define where the middle of the political spectrum is and place themselves there. Here is an example... whoever puts themselves closer to the middle collects more votes.  -------D-R----.  Now clearly there is also a force that pulls candidates away from the center as well, but this to exists to some extent in both systems.

* The force that *pulls* candidates out of the middle in both FPTP and this system is the worry that alienating the base will lead to suppressed voter turnout.  It is the candidate in the middle of voters that actually turn out that will win under this system, so effecting turnout will still make a huge difference...

* I don't think candidates do need to cater to the entire electorate with Approval.  In IRV candidates compete over being someones second choice or third choice.  They are scared to do negative campaigning because they do not want to alienate the other candidates supporters, as they may be their supporters further down the ballot.  In this system you are not trying to get people to support you, because you could lose even if 60% support you if someone else is supported 61%.  Your goal is to get people to not vote for the other viable candidates.  It is similar to the zero sum game under FPTP that leads to all the negative ads we see in our elections.  I don't want vote suppression to be the dominant style of campaigning.

* Now for what I consider the most important point, which is related to the strategic voting.  How do I know who I want to approve of.  In FPTP I look and decide which of two candidates I like better, under IRV I just order the candidates in the order I would like to see them in office.  However, under this if I have my candidates in order of preference, how do I know where to stop voting... how do I know where the threshold of approval is.
The only way for me to know how to vote, is to look at polling data, and vote based on who I think the election will come down to.  So if it comes down to two candidates, I am essentially doing the same thing as in FPTP, choosing which one of the two I think is the best.  If it comes down to more than two candidates that are close, then I am in a situation where I may be voting against my own interests based on my guess as to what is going to happen.  If I really want ML but want M over MR, I don't know who to vote for.

What do you see as the advantages of this over IRV?

In my mind IRV is similar but handles all of these issues much better.  It has a potential strategic voting problem, but it is much much less dramatic and much much rarer.  IRV discourages negative ads.  IRV has the same effect of making the moderate candidate win most of the time.  
Your system does make it happen a little more because of the universal second choice problem, however this is not only rare, but I question if it is good for an election to encourage people to be so bland and nonaggressive in their proposals so as to attempt to be the universal second choice.

However, with radical reform, it is theoretically possible to move to a multi-party system, thanks to the stark social cleavages in American society - whether this would be a good thing is unknowable.

Duverger's Law is a principle in political science that states that plurality based electoral systems (So, ones where a plurality rather than a majority of votes are required to win, as nearly all American elections do) favour two party systems. There are what are called ""mechanical"" and ""strategic"" effects from plurality based voting systems which maintain this.

Mechanical effects have to do with the way votes are translated into seats, or public offices. Take a state, say, Subotania, that has multiple congressional districts, with concentrations of Republicans in the South and Democrats in the North of the state. If a new party, such as the Whig Party, is established and quickly gathers broad electoral appeal across Subotania, when it comes to election time, they'll be screwed over. As the Whig vote is spread across the state, rather than being concentrated in particular districts like the two main parties are, they'll be second place in a lot of the districts, but first in none. Under a proportional system, with congressmen elected across the state on the proportion of the votes their party receives, the Whigs stand a good chance of getting some seats.

Strategic effects have to do with how the electoral system changes voter behaviour. Even if you really like the small Whig Party, if you absolutely detest the Democrats, whilst being less unfavourable towards Republicans, under a plurality-based system, you are likely as a voter to vote in order to keep your least-preferred preference out i.e. you will vote GOP to stop the Dems from getting in. This is not a problem you would have under proportional representation, as seats are allocated on the proportion of votes each party receives. Of course, if you as the typical voter are doing this, then loads of other typical would-be Whig voters are doing the same,[ in order to stop the wrong lizard from getting in.](http://wso.williams.edu/~rcarson/lizards.html)

Another strategic effect is that new political elites, although they may prefer to set up their own party, will in a plurality based system hitch on to the party closest to their views, in order to secure power. This harms the ability of new parties to organise effectively and campaign for votes.

Multi-party systems are also a lot more common in parliamentary systems of government, as these allow for the possibility of inter-party coalitions. Given that the US Executive is concentrated in one individual, this is not possible in the USA. If you are a voter for the Whig party in a United States that has proportional elections to Congress, in order to secure preferable policy outcomes, you may vote for one of the two main party's candidates for President, in order to keep the other lizard out. If the United States had a parliamentarian system of government (Which, unlike electoral reform, is not a reform that could ever happen), then you could happily vote for the Whigs knowing that they had a chance of participating in government.

One of the necessary conditions for a multi-party system are multiple, politicised social cleavages - the United States has a bazillion of these. A social cleavage is something which makes two different groups distinct, and is potentially political. The main ones are class, religious-secular, urban-rural, peripheral-central, ethnic and materialist-post-materialist (So environmentalism vs. growth). The United States has all of these, and all are extremely politicised - it is probably only the Constitution and its electoral system which stops an actual multi-party system from developing. What's interesting is that these cleavages are often not only represented between the two main parties already (As in - most blacks vote for Democrats, those wanting a less centralised government vote Republican), but that they are also reflected within the *parties*. For example, look at environmentalism and the Democrats - most Dems in Congress are for action on CO2 emissions, except those representatives from coal states. It is the electoral system which confines such divisions within the parties and stops the development of multiple, electorally effective parties that clearly reflect these social divisions.

In conclusion, the end of the two party system requires social cleavages (which the USA has) and is really strongly helped by a proportional voting system (There are examples of two-party systems in countries with proportional voting, such as Malta, but these are very rare, and have very few social cleavages). Given the level of entrenchment of parties within the United States in the present day, electoral reform is *de facto* necessary. Voting via the internet has nothing whatsoever to do with it, and people calling for a third party without corresponding electoral reform may as well be calling to build a bridge to the moon. Pretty much any proportional system will do - I personally like the mixed German version.

I'm so sorry you are going through this but things can and will change. You are at university which means two great things: new people are going to arrive all the time, so you can make new friends who will love and support you for who you are; and you are getting an education which means when you graduate you don't have to stay where you are. You can go anywhere, and you should. Apply to jobs with gay friendly policies that have offices in big cities with a big gay population; work on your self-confidence (maybe see if there is counselling available on campus); find interests that you like and make you happy and where cool liberal people tend to hang out; get the best degree you can; and then get the fuck out of there. 


The thing about being young (teens, early twenties) is that you think the way you/things are now will be the way it is forever. I'm only 24 but I'm finally learning that shit just ain't true. Things change all the time, usually for the better. You can improve the odds of things improving by believing that it will and letting it happen when it does.

In Houston there is by far more opportunities then is first seen when looking at this city. The arts are here and growing.  If you like art, theatre, live shows,  music or what not you can find it.  As others have said Rice sits right near the heart of the ""gayborhood"" and there by puts it very close to the most accepting area of town.

I have never had a problem since I moved here in 2005.  Pretty much most in Houston keep to them selves unless invited in.  But at the same time will outwardly be friendly even if they don't accept 100% our sexual identity. 

I would say in many ways the Gay community here in Houston is in it's Young Adult phase of maturity.  It has ironed out a bunch of the drama and childhood growing pains, but still at times throws a fit about stuff. It has a long way to go to being like other major cities who have very well established gay communities.

The best thing you can do is get involved find groups on campus and off of campus.  Getting involved in the local community and not just campus community is key to feeling included.  I for one am involved with a nice group of people we meet every Thursday at the StarBucks at West Grey and Shepard (very close to Rice and Montrose) for Coffee and Conversation.  It is a GLBT group and includes all types people. Feel free to always stop by.  We are there between 7:30ish till 11ish.  But the first Thursday we meet around 7 and then go out to eat together near by.  It's very casual and we always welcome new people.

So in a nut shell get involved and get out.  You will feel secluded if you stay on campus all the time and not included in the community. Involvement is key.

If they can recognize chord tones vs non-chord tones and extended harmony 9ths 11ths 13ths etc..

Maybe introduce song form AAB, AABA; point them to some jazz to listen to in order to hear the difference. Possibly even find an arrangement that is written out, but in an ""authentic jazz style"" (as much as it pains me to say that) to make sure its something they like. 

Analyze it (aforementioned arrangement); chords? extentions? where is the melody? bass-line? where does the harmonic progression end, and subsequently begin again?

And most importantly, make sure they understand the importance of rhythm, not even necessarily jazz rhythms, but just basic, four beats in a measure, rhythm.

Make sure they can execute 3/4 and 4/4 without adding or dropping beats.

Learn scales. Have at least a minimal amount of facility on the piano.

Strategic voting is why our current system only has two parties...

If we have 5 candidates

FL L M R and FR 
(listed in order of ideology from left to right)  
Under this system I am supposed to vote for the candidates I approve of.  I am going to assume that in this example I am in ideological agreement with FL, but even if I were moderate or on the right, the same problem would exist. 
I prefer ANYONE to FR, but I think it is unlikely he will win, so I likely will not approve of R as I want him less than any other candidate other than FR who I have already discarded.  Now the question is who do I think out of L M and R has the best chance of winning.

If I think that based on polling data L and M are the strongest candidates I DO NOT want to vote for M, as this only hurts the chances of L winning.

On the other hand, if I think the race is between R and M, well then I want to vote for M as I don't want R to win.

This means that I now have base my vote, not after what I want the outcome of the election to be but instead based on how I think everyone else is going to vote.
This is backwards, as it is making votes reflect expected votes, not voter desires.  I think this strategic voting problem is even more dramatic than the strategic voting problem in the current First Past the Post voting system.

Now, this is true in the South...but Houston isn't really part of the South. I was born and raised there, and my parents are super liberal.

I would say both political parties are in delusion. The Republicans have been squandered by the criminal neoconservative agenda. An oppressive group driven by a military big business resource stealing worldwide. Far, far from the ideals of the original Republican Party.

Until public opinion and understanding of this, change will not happen. Those in control of the party structure must be removed and routed.

I've had a few students who have come from teachers who focus on beginner/intermediate players who have attempted to teach them jazz.  The students come away with knowledge of the blues scale and a few vanilla-sounding root-position voicings.  We generally have to start over at the beginning.

Things in the classical world can be easier to teach because you're usually dealing with a set piece of music with very rigid rules.  There are still rules in jazz, but they are much more flexible and the amount of freedom can be overwhelming for student and teacher if they are unprepared.

Anyway, that's just my two cents.  I feel that knowing your limitations as a teacher will make you a better teacher in the long run.",t1_c4bezv5,t3_s64k3,,t3_s64k3,1,SE
